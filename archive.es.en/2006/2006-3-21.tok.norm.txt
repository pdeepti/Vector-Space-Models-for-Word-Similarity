fifa says there is no link between the injury of oulmers and where charleroi finished in the league last season , fifth . " we are in court today because fifa were not willing to reach a compromise out of court with the club , " charleroi 's lawyer jean-pierre deprez told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter will have to stay on the ball in the tricky case deprez said charleroi chairman abbas bayat met fifa president sepp blatter late on friday but they were unable to reach agreement . " we will drop our case if we receive compensation , " deprez said .
" the figure is 615,000 euros -lrb- $ 749,100 -rrb- . " g14 says fifa regulatio n s u n fair in his opening speech to a belgium court on monday , g14 lawyer jean-louis dupont said fifa should be forced to compensate clubs who have been deprived of players ' services because they played in the national team and perhaps subsequently missed club games because of injury while playing at international level . " the g14 demands 860 million euros in damages from the international football federation -lrb- fifa -rrb- to cover the losses incurred by the 18 clubs in the g14 over the past 10 years , " dupont said .
" this figure covers the cost of putting players at fifa 's disposal and their unavailability after they have been injured while playing for the national team . " fifa called for a suspension of the hearing , which was refused by the court . g14 , which in the past has often been at loggerheads with soccer 's world ruling body , has also called for a revision of fifa 's regulations which they say constitute an abuse of power and violates european law on human rights . currently , players who are uninjured and eligible for international duty can not be retained by their clubs - a ruling which the g14 feels violates european law . article 37 of fifa 's regulations also stipulates that a club which provides players for international duty has no right to financial compensation , and the club alone is responsible for paying any insurance for the player . g14 thus regard clubs as being sanctioned twice when players return injured from international duty : as well as missing his services they must also continue paying his salary as well as pay for his treatment . pote n tially la n dmark case if this case follows the path of the one which changed the face of soccer a decade ago , it could have huge ramifications for fifa , and the game itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the world cup are on in full swing in germany ten years ago , the european courts ' jean-marc bosman ruling opened the way for players in europe to ply their trade openly in any other country affiliated with uefa . g14 lawyer dupont said in spite of the revenue generated by fifa at this summer 's world cup , none of the clubs who provide players will benefit . " the world cup in germany this year will generate 2.5 billion euros in revenue , " he said .
" yet not one euro will be given back to the clubs who have provided the crucial ingredient to this truly global tournament : the players , the employees of the clubs . " the case is n't expected to be decided before the soccer world cup in germany this summer and is most likely expected to end up in the european court of justice . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fifa faces legal action over world cup image rights the world 's media is threatening to take legal action against fifa unless soccer ’ s governing body lifts the restrictions it has imposed on coverage at this year 's world cup .

spain missed a deadline to explain its actions for preventing the move . on monday , the european commission shrugged off spain 's failure to meet a friday deadline in telling brussels why the government had widened the powers of the country 's energy regulator , which would enable it to block e.on 's all-cash bid of 29.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.6 billion -rrb- for endesa . " we have enough information to come to a conclusion without the information from the spanish government , " eu spokesman oliver drewes told ap . according to those close to the matter , proceedings against spain for violation of eu treaties could begin next month .
such an action could last years and could eventually end up in the european court of justice . brussels has voiced concerns that madrid 's plans could create " obstacles " to energy firms from other eu countries seeking to move into the spanish market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on is ready to pay 29 billion euros for spain 's endesa the plans have spurred eu regulators into action because german energy giant e.on is in the midst of a hostile bid for the spanish group endesa , which madrid is deeply opposed to and wants to block , favoring instead an earlier but lower bid from a domestic company , gas natural . judge orders suspension but on tuesday , a madrid judge ordered the provisional suspension of the hostile takeover bid by gas natural for endesa at endesa 's request , a judicial source said . the judge made the suspension conditional on endesa paying the court within 10 days a guarantee of billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- against any damages arising from the proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endesa filed to have a bid by gas natural stopped , and was successful endesa brought the case saying that a pre-agreement for spanish energy group iberdrola to pick up between seven billion and nine billion euros of gas natural assets , to be divested in the event of a successful bid , violated article 81 of eu rules on free trade . gas natural can appeal against the decision which came less than a week after the european commission refused to extend madrid 's deadline to explain its backing for the bid in preference to a bigger offer from german giant e.on. the judge also suspended a pre-agreement reached between gas natural and electricity provider iberdrola sa on the sale of assets if the takeover went ahead . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

such an action could last years and could eventually end up in the european court of justice . brussels has voiced concerns that madrid 's plans could create " obstacles " to energy firms from other eu countries seeking to move into the spanish market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on is ready to pay 29 billion euros for spain 's endesa the plans have spurred eu regulators into action because german energy giant e.on is in the midst of a hostile bid for the spanish group endesa , which madrid is deeply opposed to and wants to block , favoring instead an earlier but lower bid from a domestic company , gas natural . judge orders suspension but on tuesday , a madrid judge ordered the provisional suspension of the hostile takeover bid by gas natural for endesa at endesa 's request , a judicial source said . the judge made the suspension conditional on endesa paying the court within 10 days a guarantee of billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- against any damages arising from the proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endesa filed to have a bid by gas natural stopped , and was successful endesa brought the case saying that a pre-agreement for spanish energy group iberdrola to pick up between seven billion and nine billion euros of gas natural assets , to be divested in the event of a successful bid , violated article 81 of eu rules on free trade . gas natural can appeal against the decision which came less than a week after the european commission refused to extend madrid 's deadline to explain its backing for the bid in preference to a bigger offer from german giant e.on. the judge also suspended a pre-agreement reached between gas natural and electricity provider iberdrola sa on the sale of assets if the takeover went ahead . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .
by that time , the restrictions placed upon the 10 member states which joined the eu in 2005 will have expired and the entire european market will be open for both workers and services r & d essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more r & d could be good for german carmakers , verheugen thinks despite the problems about staying competitive , verheugen called on member states and companies to invest more heavily in research and development .
studies have shown that investment in these areas leads to better economic performance .
he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation . " the company does n't even mention its double-digit rates of return , since those are simply a result of this approach , " he said .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .

he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation .

spain missed a deadline to explain its actions for preventing the move . on monday , the european commission shrugged off spain 's failure to meet a friday deadline in telling brussels why the government had widened the powers of the country 's energy regulator , which would enable it to block e.on 's all-cash bid of 29.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.6 billion -rrb- for endesa . " we have enough information to come to a conclusion without the information from the spanish government , " eu spokesman oliver drewes told ap . according to those close to the matter , proceedings against spain for violation of eu treaties could begin next month .
such an action could last years and could eventually end up in the european court of justice . brussels has voiced concerns that madrid 's plans could create " obstacles " to energy firms from other eu countries seeking to move into the spanish market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on is ready to pay 29 billion euros for spain 's endesa the plans have spurred eu regulators into action because german energy giant e.on is in the midst of a hostile bid for the spanish group endesa , which madrid is deeply opposed to and wants to block , favoring instead an earlier but lower bid from a domestic company , gas natural . judge orders suspension but on tuesday , a madrid judge ordered the provisional suspension of the hostile takeover bid by gas natural for endesa at endesa 's request , a judicial source said . the judge made the suspension conditional on endesa paying the court within 10 days a guarantee of billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- against any damages arising from the proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endesa filed to have a bid by gas natural stopped , and was successful endesa brought the case saying that a pre-agreement for spanish energy group iberdrola to pick up between seven billion and nine billion euros of gas natural assets , to be divested in the event of a successful bid , violated article 81 of eu rules on free trade . gas natural can appeal against the decision which came less than a week after the european commission refused to extend madrid 's deadline to explain its backing for the bid in preference to a bigger offer from german giant e.on. the judge also suspended a pre-agreement reached between gas natural and electricity provider iberdrola sa on the sale of assets if the takeover went ahead . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

" that they have now turned against me , is not something i had wanted , " he said . a town official for pulheim said the local authorities were surprised at sierra 's decision but would respect it .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .
by that time , the restrictions placed upon the 10 member states which joined the eu in 2005 will have expired and the entire european market will be open for both workers and services r & d essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more r & d could be good for german carmakers , verheugen thinks despite the problems about staying competitive , verheugen called on member states and companies to invest more heavily in research and development .
studies have shown that investment in these areas leads to better economic performance .
he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation . " the company does n't even mention its double-digit rates of return , since those are simply a result of this approach , " he said .

" i feel misunderstood , " the 39-year-old artist said .
he said he did not create a gas chamber but " a work of art with the gas chamber as its theme " in the synagogue in the town of pulheim which lies near the western city of cologne . " there is a difference , " he said , adding that artists had the duty to " create difficult art to deal with painful episodes in history .

fifa says there is no link between the injury of oulmers and where charleroi finished in the league last season , fifth . " we are in court today because fifa were not willing to reach a compromise out of court with the club , " charleroi 's lawyer jean-pierre deprez told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter will have to stay on the ball in the tricky case deprez said charleroi chairman abbas bayat met fifa president sepp blatter late on friday but they were unable to reach agreement . " we will drop our case if we receive compensation , " deprez said .
" the figure is 615,000 euros -lrb- $ 749,100 -rrb- . " g14 says fifa regulatio n s u n fair in his opening speech to a belgium court on monday , g14 lawyer jean-louis dupont said fifa should be forced to compensate clubs who have been deprived of players ' services because they played in the national team and perhaps subsequently missed club games because of injury while playing at international level . " the g14 demands 860 million euros in damages from the international football federation -lrb- fifa -rrb- to cover the losses incurred by the 18 clubs in the g14 over the past 10 years , " dupont said .
" this figure covers the cost of putting players at fifa 's disposal and their unavailability after they have been injured while playing for the national team . " fifa called for a suspension of the hearing , which was refused by the court . g14 , which in the past has often been at loggerheads with soccer 's world ruling body , has also called for a revision of fifa 's regulations which they say constitute an abuse of power and violates european law on human rights . currently , players who are uninjured and eligible for international duty can not be retained by their clubs - a ruling which the g14 feels violates european law . article 37 of fifa 's regulations also stipulates that a club which provides players for international duty has no right to financial compensation , and the club alone is responsible for paying any insurance for the player . g14 thus regard clubs as being sanctioned twice when players return injured from international duty : as well as missing his services they must also continue paying his salary as well as pay for his treatment . pote n tially la n dmark case if this case follows the path of the one which changed the face of soccer a decade ago , it could have huge ramifications for fifa , and the game itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the world cup are on in full swing in germany ten years ago , the european courts ' jean-marc bosman ruling opened the way for players in europe to ply their trade openly in any other country affiliated with uefa . g14 lawyer dupont said in spite of the revenue generated by fifa at this summer 's world cup , none of the clubs who provide players will benefit . " the world cup in germany this year will generate 2.5 billion euros in revenue , " he said .
" yet not one euro will be given back to the clubs who have provided the crucial ingredient to this truly global tournament : the players , the employees of the clubs .

spain missed a deadline to explain its actions for preventing the move . on monday , the european commission shrugged off spain 's failure to meet a friday deadline in telling brussels why the government had widened the powers of the country 's energy regulator , which would enable it to block e.on 's all-cash bid of 29.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.6 billion -rrb- for endesa . " we have enough information to come to a conclusion without the information from the spanish government , " eu spokesman oliver drewes told ap . according to those close to the matter , proceedings against spain for violation of eu treaties could begin next month .
such an action could last years and could eventually end up in the european court of justice . brussels has voiced concerns that madrid 's plans could create " obstacles " to energy firms from other eu countries seeking to move into the spanish market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on is ready to pay 29 billion euros for spain 's endesa the plans have spurred eu regulators into action because german energy giant e.on is in the midst of a hostile bid for the spanish group endesa , which madrid is deeply opposed to and wants to block , favoring instead an earlier but lower bid from a domestic company , gas natural . judge orders suspension but on tuesday , a madrid judge ordered the provisional suspension of the hostile takeover bid by gas natural for endesa at endesa 's request , a judicial source said . the judge made the suspension conditional on endesa paying the court within 10 days a guarantee of billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- against any damages arising from the proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endesa filed to have a bid by gas natural stopped , and was successful endesa brought the case saying that a pre-agreement for spanish energy group iberdrola to pick up between seven billion and nine billion euros of gas natural assets , to be divested in the event of a successful bid , violated article 81 of eu rules on free trade . gas natural can appeal against the decision which came less than a week after the european commission refused to extend madrid 's deadline to explain its backing for the bid in preference to a bigger offer from german giant e.on. the judge also suspended a pre-agreement reached between gas natural and electricity provider iberdrola sa on the sale of assets if the takeover went ahead . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.03.2006 opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration courses should help immigrants on the path to citizenship germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .
but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .
but do these new tests unfairly target muslims ?

but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .
by that time , the restrictions placed upon the 10 member states which joined the eu in 2005 will have expired and the entire european market will be open for both workers and services r & d essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more r & d could be good for german carmakers , verheugen thinks despite the problems about staying competitive , verheugen called on member states and companies to invest more heavily in research and development .
studies have shown that investment in these areas leads to better economic performance .
he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation . " the company does n't even mention its double-digit rates of return , since those are simply a result of this approach , " he said .

but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .

he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation .

" restricting entry visas is possible if it is done selectively and aims to affect the people surrounding lukashenko , " spd foreign affairs spokesperson gert weisskirchen told the berli n er zeitu n g . " the european union can not accept these perverted , soviet-style elections , " eckart von klaeden of the cdu said . marie-luise beck , green party politician and election observer from the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , told ndr radio that in the run-up to the elections , " every type of democratic election process was completely abandoned . " the united states has also said it would work with the european union in taking action against those belarus officials responsible for election fraud and human rights abuses .
white house spokesperson scott mcclellan said travel restrictions and targeted financial sanctions , such as freezing foreign accounts of particular individuals , could be possibilities . lukashe n ko oppo n e n ts detai n ed meanwhile , four aides to belarus ' main opposition presidential candidate , alexander milinkevich , were detained on tuesday close to a square in central minsk where protesters had spent the night . " alexander dobrovolsky , anatoly lebedko , alexei yanukiyevich and valentina polevikova were arrested , " pavel mazheika , a spokesman for milinkevich , told the afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milinkevich supporters are not giving up easily he added that " several dozen " other people who had been protesting against the landslide re-election victory of authoritarian president alexander lukashenko had also been detained overnight . lebedko is head of the united civil party -lrb- ucp -rrb- , a liberal group that chose milinkevich to represent the united democratic forces coalition against lukashenko in sunday 's controversial presidential vote . polevikova and dobrovolsky are senior ucp officials and yanukiyevich is a member of another opposition group , the belarussian popular front . polevikova , who was later released , told the afp news agency , that she was with lebedko and dobrovolsky when they were arrested .
she said she had been prevented from re-entering oktyabrskaya square , where around 300 mostly young people rallied in freezing temperatures and in defiance of a government ban . " we came back to the square but some police officers in plain clothes arrived , " polevikova said , adding she had been forcibly taken home by the officers .
" they took the men and put them in a minibus and they told the women to stay at home and bring up children . " there was no information on the whereabouts of the other three activists . lebedko had been due to attend a hearing tuesday for " insults " uttered during a brief detention on march 15 in the run-up to the election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.03.2006 opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration courses should help immigrants on the path to citizenship germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .
but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .
by that time , the restrictions placed upon the 10 member states which joined the eu in 2005 will have expired and the entire european market will be open for both workers and services r & d essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more r & d could be good for german carmakers , verheugen thinks despite the problems about staying competitive , verheugen called on member states and companies to invest more heavily in research and development .
studies have shown that investment in these areas leads to better economic performance .
he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation . " the company does n't even mention its double-digit rates of return , since those are simply a result of this approach , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.03.2006 opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration courses should help immigrants on the path to citizenship germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .
but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .
but do these new tests unfairly target muslims ?

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .
by that time , the restrictions placed upon the 10 member states which joined the eu in 2005 will have expired and the entire european market will be open for both workers and services r & d essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more r & d could be good for german carmakers , verheugen thinks despite the problems about staying competitive , verheugen called on member states and companies to invest more heavily in research and development .
studies have shown that investment in these areas leads to better economic performance .
he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation . " the company does n't even mention its double-digit rates of return , since those are simply a result of this approach , " he said .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .
by that time , the restrictions placed upon the 10 member states which joined the eu in 2005 will have expired and the entire european market will be open for both workers and services r & d essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more r & d could be good for german carmakers , verheugen thinks despite the problems about staying competitive , verheugen called on member states and companies to invest more heavily in research and development .
studies have shown that investment in these areas leads to better economic performance .
he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation . " the company does n't even mention its double-digit rates of return , since those are simply a result of this approach , " he said .

fifa says there is no link between the injury of oulmers and where charleroi finished in the league last season , fifth . " we are in court today because fifa were not willing to reach a compromise out of court with the club , " charleroi 's lawyer jean-pierre deprez told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter will have to stay on the ball in the tricky case deprez said charleroi chairman abbas bayat met fifa president sepp blatter late on friday but they were unable to reach agreement . " we will drop our case if we receive compensation , " deprez said .
" the figure is 615,000 euros -lrb- $ 749,100 -rrb- . " g14 says fifa regulatio n s u n fair in his opening speech to a belgium court on monday , g14 lawyer jean-louis dupont said fifa should be forced to compensate clubs who have been deprived of players ' services because they played in the national team and perhaps subsequently missed club games because of injury while playing at international level . " the g14 demands 860 million euros in damages from the international football federation -lrb- fifa -rrb- to cover the losses incurred by the 18 clubs in the g14 over the past 10 years , " dupont said .
" this figure covers the cost of putting players at fifa 's disposal and their unavailability after they have been injured while playing for the national team . " fifa called for a suspension of the hearing , which was refused by the court . g14 , which in the past has often been at loggerheads with soccer 's world ruling body , has also called for a revision of fifa 's regulations which they say constitute an abuse of power and violates european law on human rights . currently , players who are uninjured and eligible for international duty can not be retained by their clubs - a ruling which the g14 feels violates european law . article 37 of fifa 's regulations also stipulates that a club which provides players for international duty has no right to financial compensation , and the club alone is responsible for paying any insurance for the player . g14 thus regard clubs as being sanctioned twice when players return injured from international duty : as well as missing his services they must also continue paying his salary as well as pay for his treatment . pote n tially la n dmark case if this case follows the path of the one which changed the face of soccer a decade ago , it could have huge ramifications for fifa , and the game itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the world cup are on in full swing in germany ten years ago , the european courts ' jean-marc bosman ruling opened the way for players in europe to ply their trade openly in any other country affiliated with uefa . g14 lawyer dupont said in spite of the revenue generated by fifa at this summer 's world cup , none of the clubs who provide players will benefit . " the world cup in germany this year will generate 2.5 billion euros in revenue , " he said .
" yet not one euro will be given back to the clubs who have provided the crucial ingredient to this truly global tournament : the players , the employees of the clubs . " the case is n't expected to be decided before the soccer world cup in germany this summer and is most likely expected to end up in the european court of justice . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fifa faces legal action over world cup image rights the world 's media is threatening to take legal action against fifa unless soccer ’ s governing body lifts the restrictions it has imposed on coverage at this year 's world cup .

" i feel misunderstood , " the 39-year-old artist said .
he said he did not create a gas chamber but " a work of art with the gas chamber as its theme " in the synagogue in the town of pulheim which lies near the western city of cologne .

" that they have now turned against me , is not something i had wanted , " he said . a town official for pulheim said the local authorities were surprised at sierra 's decision but would respect it .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .

he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation .

fifa says there is no link between the injury of oulmers and where charleroi finished in the league last season , fifth . " we are in court today because fifa were not willing to reach a compromise out of court with the club , " charleroi 's lawyer jean-pierre deprez told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter will have to stay on the ball in the tricky case deprez said charleroi chairman abbas bayat met fifa president sepp blatter late on friday but they were unable to reach agreement . " we will drop our case if we receive compensation , " deprez said .
" the figure is 615,000 euros -lrb- $ 749,100 -rrb- . " g14 says fifa regulatio n s u n fair in his opening speech to a belgium court on monday , g14 lawyer jean-louis dupont said fifa should be forced to compensate clubs who have been deprived of players ' services because they played in the national team and perhaps subsequently missed club games because of injury while playing at international level . " the g14 demands 860 million euros in damages from the international football federation -lrb- fifa -rrb- to cover the losses incurred by the 18 clubs in the g14 over the past 10 years , " dupont said .
" this figure covers the cost of putting players at fifa 's disposal and their unavailability after they have been injured while playing for the national team . " fifa called for a suspension of the hearing , which was refused by the court . g14 , which in the past has often been at loggerheads with soccer 's world ruling body , has also called for a revision of fifa 's regulations which they say constitute an abuse of power and violates european law on human rights . currently , players who are uninjured and eligible for international duty can not be retained by their clubs - a ruling which the g14 feels violates european law . article 37 of fifa 's regulations also stipulates that a club which provides players for international duty has no right to financial compensation , and the club alone is responsible for paying any insurance for the player . g14 thus regard clubs as being sanctioned twice when players return injured from international duty : as well as missing his services they must also continue paying his salary as well as pay for his treatment . pote n tially la n dmark case if this case follows the path of the one which changed the face of soccer a decade ago , it could have huge ramifications for fifa , and the game itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the world cup are on in full swing in germany ten years ago , the european courts ' jean-marc bosman ruling opened the way for players in europe to ply their trade openly in any other country affiliated with uefa . g14 lawyer dupont said in spite of the revenue generated by fifa at this summer 's world cup , none of the clubs who provide players will benefit . " the world cup in germany this year will generate 2.5 billion euros in revenue , " he said .
" yet not one euro will be given back to the clubs who have provided the crucial ingredient to this truly global tournament : the players , the employees of the clubs .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .
by that time , the restrictions placed upon the 10 member states which joined the eu in 2005 will have expired and the entire european market will be open for both workers and services r & d essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more r & d could be good for german carmakers , verheugen thinks despite the problems about staying competitive , verheugen called on member states and companies to invest more heavily in research and development .
studies have shown that investment in these areas leads to better economic performance .
he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation . " the company does n't even mention its double-digit rates of return , since those are simply a result of this approach , " he said .

but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

spain missed a deadline to explain its actions for preventing the move . on monday , the european commission shrugged off spain 's failure to meet a friday deadline in telling brussels why the government had widened the powers of the country 's energy regulator , which would enable it to block e.on 's all-cash bid of 29.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.6 billion -rrb- for endesa . " we have enough information to come to a conclusion without the information from the spanish government , " eu spokesman oliver drewes told ap . according to those close to the matter , proceedings against spain for violation of eu treaties could begin next month .
such an action could last years and could eventually end up in the european court of justice . brussels has voiced concerns that madrid 's plans could create " obstacles " to energy firms from other eu countries seeking to move into the spanish market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on is ready to pay 29 billion euros for spain 's endesa the plans have spurred eu regulators into action because german energy giant e.on is in the midst of a hostile bid for the spanish group endesa , which madrid is deeply opposed to and wants to block , favoring instead an earlier but lower bid from a domestic company , gas natural . judge orders suspension but on tuesday , a madrid judge ordered the provisional suspension of the hostile takeover bid by gas natural for endesa at endesa 's request , a judicial source said . the judge made the suspension conditional on endesa paying the court within 10 days a guarantee of billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- against any damages arising from the proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endesa filed to have a bid by gas natural stopped , and was successful endesa brought the case saying that a pre-agreement for spanish energy group iberdrola to pick up between seven billion and nine billion euros of gas natural assets , to be divested in the event of a successful bid , violated article 81 of eu rules on free trade . gas natural can appeal against the decision which came less than a week after the european commission refused to extend madrid 's deadline to explain its backing for the bid in preference to a bigger offer from german giant e.on. the judge also suspended a pre-agreement reached between gas natural and electricity provider iberdrola sa on the sale of assets if the takeover went ahead . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .
by that time , the restrictions placed upon the 10 member states which joined the eu in 2005 will have expired and the entire european market will be open for both workers and services r & d essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more r & d could be good for german carmakers , verheugen thinks despite the problems about staying competitive , verheugen called on member states and companies to invest more heavily in research and development .
studies have shown that investment in these areas leads to better economic performance .
he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation . " the company does n't even mention its double-digit rates of return , since those are simply a result of this approach , " he said .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .
by that time , the restrictions placed upon the 10 member states which joined the eu in 2005 will have expired and the entire european market will be open for both workers and services r & d essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more r & d could be good for german carmakers , verheugen thinks despite the problems about staying competitive , verheugen called on member states and companies to invest more heavily in research and development .
studies have shown that investment in these areas leads to better economic performance .
he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation . " the company does n't even mention its double-digit rates of return , since those are simply a result of this approach , " he said .
" a few german automakers could learn a thing or two from that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.03.2006 opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration courses should help immigrants on the path to citizenship germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .
but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .
by that time , the restrictions placed upon the 10 member states which joined the eu in 2005 will have expired and the entire european market will be open for both workers and services r & d essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more r & d could be good for german carmakers , verheugen thinks despite the problems about staying competitive , verheugen called on member states and companies to invest more heavily in research and development .
studies have shown that investment in these areas leads to better economic performance .
he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation . " the company does n't even mention its double-digit rates of return , since those are simply a result of this approach , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.03.2006 opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration courses should help immigrants on the path to citizenship germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .
but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .
but do these new tests unfairly target muslims ?

" that they have now turned against me , is not something i had wanted , " he said . a town official for pulheim said the local authorities were surprised at sierra 's decision but would respect it .

spain missed a deadline to explain its actions for preventing the move . on monday , the european commission shrugged off spain 's failure to meet a friday deadline in telling brussels why the government had widened the powers of the country 's energy regulator , which would enable it to block e.on 's all-cash bid of 29.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.6 billion -rrb- for endesa . " we have enough information to come to a conclusion without the information from the spanish government , " eu spokesman oliver drewes told ap . according to those close to the matter , proceedings against spain for violation of eu treaties could begin next month .
such an action could last years and could eventually end up in the european court of justice . brussels has voiced concerns that madrid 's plans could create " obstacles " to energy firms from other eu countries seeking to move into the spanish market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on is ready to pay 29 billion euros for spain 's endesa the plans have spurred eu regulators into action because german energy giant e.on is in the midst of a hostile bid for the spanish group endesa , which madrid is deeply opposed to and wants to block , favoring instead an earlier but lower bid from a domestic company , gas natural . judge orders suspension but on tuesday , a madrid judge ordered the provisional suspension of the hostile takeover bid by gas natural for endesa at endesa 's request , a judicial source said . the judge made the suspension conditional on endesa paying the court within 10 days a guarantee of billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- against any damages arising from the proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endesa filed to have a bid by gas natural stopped , and was successful endesa brought the case saying that a pre-agreement for spanish energy group iberdrola to pick up between seven billion and nine billion euros of gas natural assets , to be divested in the event of a successful bid , violated article 81 of eu rules on free trade . gas natural can appeal against the decision which came less than a week after the european commission refused to extend madrid 's deadline to explain its backing for the bid in preference to a bigger offer from german giant e.on. the judge also suspended a pre-agreement reached between gas natural and electricity provider iberdrola sa on the sale of assets if the takeover went ahead . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

spain missed a deadline to explain its actions for preventing the move . on monday , the european commission shrugged off spain 's failure to meet a friday deadline in telling brussels why the government had widened the powers of the country 's energy regulator , which would enable it to block e.on 's all-cash bid of 29.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.6 billion -rrb- for endesa . " we have enough information to come to a conclusion without the information from the spanish government , " eu spokesman oliver drewes told ap . according to those close to the matter , proceedings against spain for violation of eu treaties could begin next month .
such an action could last years and could eventually end up in the european court of justice . brussels has voiced concerns that madrid 's plans could create " obstacles " to energy firms from other eu countries seeking to move into the spanish market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on is ready to pay 29 billion euros for spain 's endesa the plans have spurred eu regulators into action because german energy giant e.on is in the midst of a hostile bid for the spanish group endesa , which madrid is deeply opposed to and wants to block , favoring instead an earlier but lower bid from a domestic company , gas natural . judge orders suspension but on tuesday , a madrid judge ordered the provisional suspension of the hostile takeover bid by gas natural for endesa at endesa 's request , a judicial source said . the judge made the suspension conditional on endesa paying the court within 10 days a guarantee of billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- against any damages arising from the proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endesa filed to have a bid by gas natural stopped , and was successful endesa brought the case saying that a pre-agreement for spanish energy group iberdrola to pick up between seven billion and nine billion euros of gas natural assets , to be divested in the event of a successful bid , violated article 81 of eu rules on free trade . gas natural can appeal against the decision which came less than a week after the european commission refused to extend madrid 's deadline to explain its backing for the bid in preference to a bigger offer from german giant e.on. the judge also suspended a pre-agreement reached between gas natural and electricity provider iberdrola sa on the sale of assets if the takeover went ahead . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .
by that time , the restrictions placed upon the 10 member states which joined the eu in 2005 will have expired and the entire european market will be open for both workers and services r & d essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more r & d could be good for german carmakers , verheugen thinks despite the problems about staying competitive , verheugen called on member states and companies to invest more heavily in research and development .
studies have shown that investment in these areas leads to better economic performance .
he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation . " the company does n't even mention its double-digit rates of return , since those are simply a result of this approach , " he said .

but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

spain missed a deadline to explain its actions for preventing the move . on monday , the european commission shrugged off spain 's failure to meet a friday deadline in telling brussels why the government had widened the powers of the country 's energy regulator , which would enable it to block e.on 's all-cash bid of 29.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.6 billion -rrb- for endesa . " we have enough information to come to a conclusion without the information from the spanish government , " eu spokesman oliver drewes told ap . according to those close to the matter , proceedings against spain for violation of eu treaties could begin next month .
such an action could last years and could eventually end up in the european court of justice . brussels has voiced concerns that madrid 's plans could create " obstacles " to energy firms from other eu countries seeking to move into the spanish market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on is ready to pay 29 billion euros for spain 's endesa the plans have spurred eu regulators into action because german energy giant e.on is in the midst of a hostile bid for the spanish group endesa , which madrid is deeply opposed to and wants to block , favoring instead an earlier but lower bid from a domestic company , gas natural . judge orders suspension but on tuesday , a madrid judge ordered the provisional suspension of the hostile takeover bid by gas natural for endesa at endesa 's request , a judicial source said . the judge made the suspension conditional on endesa paying the court within 10 days a guarantee of billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- against any damages arising from the proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endesa filed to have a bid by gas natural stopped , and was successful endesa brought the case saying that a pre-agreement for spanish energy group iberdrola to pick up between seven billion and nine billion euros of gas natural assets , to be divested in the event of a successful bid , violated article 81 of eu rules on free trade . gas natural can appeal against the decision which came less than a week after the european commission refused to extend madrid 's deadline to explain its backing for the bid in preference to a bigger offer from german giant e.on. the judge also suspended a pre-agreement reached between gas natural and electricity provider iberdrola sa on the sale of assets if the takeover went ahead . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .
by that time , the restrictions placed upon the 10 member states which joined the eu in 2005 will have expired and the entire european market will be open for both workers and services r & d essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more r & d could be good for german carmakers , verheugen thinks despite the problems about staying competitive , verheugen called on member states and companies to invest more heavily in research and development .
studies have shown that investment in these areas leads to better economic performance .
he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation . " the company does n't even mention its double-digit rates of return , since those are simply a result of this approach , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.03.2006 opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration courses should help immigrants on the path to citizenship germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .
but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .
but do these new tests unfairly target muslims ?
-lrb- march 16 , 2006 -rrb- german citizenship-seekers to face strict tests the german state of hesse plans to introduce a test for foreigners seeking german citizenship .
they would have to answer questions about german language and culture , and swear their loyalty to the country .
-lrb- march 15 , 2006 -rrb- politicians want migrants to be put to the test the german government will again debate the possibility of nationwide citizenship tests for migrants in a special bundestag session monday .
-lrb- march 1 , 2006 -rrb- feedback do you agree with the idea of a citizenship test ?

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .
by that time , the restrictions placed upon the 10 member states which joined the eu in 2005 will have expired and the entire european market will be open for both workers and services r & d essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more r & d could be good for german carmakers , verheugen thinks despite the problems about staying competitive , verheugen called on member states and companies to invest more heavily in research and development .
studies have shown that investment in these areas leads to better economic performance .
he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation . " the company does n't even mention its double-digit rates of return , since those are simply a result of this approach , " he said .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .

fifa says there is no link between the injury of oulmers and where charleroi finished in the league last season , fifth . " we are in court today because fifa were not willing to reach a compromise out of court with the club , " charleroi 's lawyer jean-pierre deprez told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa president sepp blatter will have to stay on the ball in the tricky case deprez said charleroi chairman abbas bayat met fifa president sepp blatter late on friday but they were unable to reach agreement . " we will drop our case if we receive compensation , " deprez said .
" the figure is 615,000 euros -lrb- $ 749,100 -rrb- . " g14 says fifa regulatio n s u n fair in his opening speech to a belgium court on monday , g14 lawyer jean-louis dupont said fifa should be forced to compensate clubs who have been deprived of players ' services because they played in the national team and perhaps subsequently missed club games because of injury while playing at international level . " the g14 demands 860 million euros in damages from the international football federation -lrb- fifa -rrb- to cover the losses incurred by the 18 clubs in the g14 over the past 10 years , " dupont said .
" this figure covers the cost of putting players at fifa 's disposal and their unavailability after they have been injured while playing for the national team . " fifa called for a suspension of the hearing , which was refused by the court . g14 , which in the past has often been at loggerheads with soccer 's world ruling body , has also called for a revision of fifa 's regulations which they say constitute an abuse of power and violates european law on human rights . currently , players who are uninjured and eligible for international duty can not be retained by their clubs - a ruling which the g14 feels violates european law . article 37 of fifa 's regulations also stipulates that a club which provides players for international duty has no right to financial compensation , and the club alone is responsible for paying any insurance for the player . g14 thus regard clubs as being sanctioned twice when players return injured from international duty : as well as missing his services they must also continue paying his salary as well as pay for his treatment . pote n tially la n dmark case if this case follows the path of the one which changed the face of soccer a decade ago , it could have huge ramifications for fifa , and the game itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparations for the world cup are on in full swing in germany ten years ago , the european courts ' jean-marc bosman ruling opened the way for players in europe to ply their trade openly in any other country affiliated with uefa . g14 lawyer dupont said in spite of the revenue generated by fifa at this summer 's world cup , none of the clubs who provide players will benefit . " the world cup in germany this year will generate 2.5 billion euros in revenue , " he said .
" yet not one euro will be given back to the clubs who have provided the crucial ingredient to this truly global tournament : the players , the employees of the clubs .

spain missed a deadline to explain its actions for preventing the move . on monday , the european commission shrugged off spain 's failure to meet a friday deadline in telling brussels why the government had widened the powers of the country 's energy regulator , which would enable it to block e.on 's all-cash bid of 29.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.6 billion -rrb- for endesa . " we have enough information to come to a conclusion without the information from the spanish government , " eu spokesman oliver drewes told ap . according to those close to the matter , proceedings against spain for violation of eu treaties could begin next month .
such an action could last years and could eventually end up in the european court of justice . brussels has voiced concerns that madrid 's plans could create " obstacles " to energy firms from other eu countries seeking to move into the spanish market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on is ready to pay 29 billion euros for spain 's endesa the plans have spurred eu regulators into action because german energy giant e.on is in the midst of a hostile bid for the spanish group endesa , which madrid is deeply opposed to and wants to block , favoring instead an earlier but lower bid from a domestic company , gas natural . judge orders suspension but on tuesday , a madrid judge ordered the provisional suspension of the hostile takeover bid by gas natural for endesa at endesa 's request , a judicial source said . the judge made the suspension conditional on endesa paying the court within 10 days a guarantee of billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- against any damages arising from the proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endesa filed to have a bid by gas natural stopped , and was successful endesa brought the case saying that a pre-agreement for spanish energy group iberdrola to pick up between seven billion and nine billion euros of gas natural assets , to be divested in the event of a successful bid , violated article 81 of eu rules on free trade . gas natural can appeal against the decision which came less than a week after the european commission refused to extend madrid 's deadline to explain its backing for the bid in preference to a bigger offer from german giant e.on. the judge also suspended a pre-agreement reached between gas natural and electricity provider iberdrola sa on the sale of assets if the takeover went ahead . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .

spain missed a deadline to explain its actions for preventing the move . on monday , the european commission shrugged off spain 's failure to meet a friday deadline in telling brussels why the government had widened the powers of the country 's energy regulator , which would enable it to block e.on 's all-cash bid of 29.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.6 billion -rrb- for endesa .

such an action could last years and could eventually end up in the european court of justice . brussels has voiced concerns that madrid 's plans could create " obstacles " to energy firms from other eu countries seeking to move into the spanish market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on is ready to pay 29 billion euros for spain 's endesa the plans have spurred eu regulators into action because german energy giant e.on is in the midst of a hostile bid for the spanish group endesa , which madrid is deeply opposed to and wants to block , favoring instead an earlier but lower bid from a domestic company , gas natural . judge orders suspension but on tuesday , a madrid judge ordered the provisional suspension of the hostile takeover bid by gas natural for endesa at endesa 's request , a judicial source said . the judge made the suspension conditional on endesa paying the court within 10 days a guarantee of billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 billion -rrb- against any damages arising from the proceedings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endesa filed to have a bid by gas natural stopped , and was successful endesa brought the case saying that a pre-agreement for spanish energy group iberdrola to pick up between seven billion and nine billion euros of gas natural assets , to be divested in the event of a successful bid , violated article 81 of eu rules on free trade . gas natural can appeal against the decision which came less than a week after the european commission refused to extend madrid 's deadline to explain its backing for the bid in preference to a bigger offer from german giant e.on. the judge also suspended a pre-agreement reached between gas natural and electricity provider iberdrola sa on the sale of assets if the takeover went ahead . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .
he added , though , that service providers must do business under the rules of the country in which they are performed , particularly wage and social security regulations . he warned member states about opposing the services guidelines too strongly , since provisions for the free movement of labor go into effect in 2011 .
by that time , the restrictions placed upon the 10 member states which joined the eu in 2005 will have expired and the entire european market will be open for both workers and services r & d essential bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more r & d could be good for german carmakers , verheugen thinks despite the problems about staying competitive , verheugen called on member states and companies to invest more heavily in research and development .
studies have shown that investment in these areas leads to better economic performance .
he cited the example of japanese carmaker toyota , whose company philosophy puts first priority on the qualification and motivation of its employees followed by a strong emphasis on research , development and innovation . " the company does n't even mention its double-digit rates of return , since those are simply a result of this approach , " he said .

moving again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen has vowed to slash red tape the eu 's commissioner in charge of boosting europe 's economic performance , günter verheugen , says the entire bloc has to pull together and improve conditions for business if it wants to ever get on the right track . in 2000 , the european union unveiled its lisbon strategy which aimed to make the eu the most competitive economic region on the globe by 2010 .
that ambitious goal has been basically abandoned by eu leaders , since in 2006 many members of the bloc are still struggling with anemic growth rates . " we are going to have to try very hard if we want to at least reverse this trend by 2010 , " said verheugen . europe is trailing on international markets regarding productivity , growth and employment rates , he said , putting the blame on a lack of clear priorities , programs and guidelines within the 25-nation club . also hurting growth are rules set forth by the bloc 's national governments , which hinder the free movement of goods .
the patchwork of complicated and differing regulations across the continent has put an undue burden on companies , verheugen said . part of his approach to untying the gordian knot is an initiative he kicked off last year to reduce red tape in the eu .
while the program is still in its infancy , verheugen said it has had some effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the bureaucratic paperwork is putting the brakes on growth , verheugen said " for example , all new european legislation , all new proposals must pass a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and bureaucracy test , " he said .
" that means , what are the real cost effects for a company and will it create new levels of bureaucracy ? " competition rules at the same time , however , verheugen has called on companies to adhere to eu competition rules , and criticized the protectionist measures that some national governments have put in place to prevent takeovers by foreign companies . in the last few weeks , france has intervened to prevent a planned takeover of the french utility suez by italy 's enel .
madrid has objected to the bid by germany 's e.on for the spanish power company endesa . " the wave of national protectionism and even cheap populism is passing through europe that is very worrying , " he said .
" it runs against the idea of creating one large european domestic market whose development is determined by market forces and not by politics . " the idea of a unified domestic market has been an issue that the eu has had trouble with , especially regarding the issue of services .
it is a topic that worries both companies and employees , who are worried about foreign workers offering their services at lower costs and putting downward pressure on incomes and overall living standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-globalization protestors in warsaw the european parliament has already watered down the eu services directive , although verheugen says it is essential that service providers from all over europe are free from discrimination .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.03.2006 opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration courses should help immigrants on the path to citizenship germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .
but it should be the result of a national debate about what 's fair to demand of all foreigners - not just muslims , says dw 's deanne corbett . two german states have so far put forward proposals on how to make the citizenship process for foreigners more rigorous .
they include a list of questions on cultural norms to serve as a guideline in discussions with citizenship candidates in the state of baden-württemberg , and a list of general knowledge questions on german history , geography , politics and culture which , according to state ministers in hesse , new citizens should be able to answer . the proposals are a step in the right direction .
the fact that several other states are now considering how they would wish to regulate citizenship in the future is proof that this discussion is long overdue , just as the political debate about how to regulate immigration - a debate that was unsatisfactorily resolved only two years ago - was also long overdue . germany is an immigration country , despite the fact that many germans would prefer to continue denying the obvious .
given its demographic development , it will continue to need immigrants in the future .
integration , however , is in desperate need of improvement .
the decisions now being made about integration measures , as well as citizenship tests , are aimed at ending the ghettoization of foreigners , especially germany 's large population of muslim , mainly turkish , immigrants . it 's no coincidence that the push to regulate immigration and citizenship - not just in germany , but also in other eu countries - is happening in the post-9/11 climate when muslims are under unprecedented scrutiny .
the broad threat of islamic extremists with their well-documented hatred of the western way of life has opened germans ' eyes to the presence of islam 's followers among them , and much of what they see is negative , whether it 's a newspaper report about an honor killing in berlin , schoolyards where more turkish is spoken than german , or the forced marriage of a young , headscarf-clad woman . national approach while the desire to " weed out " those immigrants who steadfastly refuse to assimilate to or even accept the german way of life is understandable , germany should not fall into the trap of allowing each of the federal states to regulate citizenship as it sees fit ; this would only allow a plethora of flawed concepts such as those proposed by baden-württemberg and hesse to flourish . baden-württemberg 's " conversation guidelines " for civil servants , for example , immediately earned the nickname of the " muslim test , " and not without reason .
but many of the questions included to help the interviewer evaluate how tolerant a muslim candidate is - questions about female equality and homosexuality , for example - would likely elicit politically incorrect responses even from born-and-bred germans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state of hesse released a list of 100 questions that foreigners should be able to answer hesse 's list of 100 questions that someone becoming a german citizen should be able to answer was also dubious .
it 's doubtful that a large majority of germans would be able to rattle off three non-alpine german mountain ranges , know what otto hahn was famous for , or remember that caspar david friedrich 's painting of rügen features chalk cliffs as its motif . an intimidating list of quiz show-like questions is not the answer , nor is a conversation aimed at interrogating muslims about the intensity of their beliefs .
if anything , questions asked in a citizenship interview should focus on what it means to be german , though for this to happen , germans must first come up with a definition they themselves are comfortable with .
german lawmakers would also do well to remember that granting citizenship means more than rubber-stamping an application and issuing a passport .
rather , it is the culmination of an integration process that takes place in the years leading up to an immigrant 's application for citizenship .
in this respect , a continued commitment to funding integration initiatives is essential . it is perfectly acceptable to demand that immigrants who want german citizenship be asked to demonstrate their commitment to their chosen country by learning the language and making an effort to understand the political system , history and culture .
an appropriate , nationally approved test , as well as a citizenship ceremony as is common in countries founded on immigration - the united states and canada , for example - could even turn the granting of citizenship into a proud moment to be celebrated . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : testing the limits of tolerance citizenship tests are currently in fashion in europe , with germany , the netherlands and britain all revising the process by which immigrants are admitted or made nationals .
but do these new tests unfairly target muslims ?
-lrb- march 16 , 2006 -rrb- dw-world : german citizenship-seekers to face strict tests the german state of hesse plans to introduce a test for foreigners seeking german citizenship .
they would have to answer questions about german language and culture , and swear their loyalty to the country .

hayley williams , who was 13 and from newport , died in december , after the seizure began unexpectedly .
gaynor williams said she was only told once - in passing - that her daughter 's epilepsy could one day prove fatal .

hayley died during a swimming lesson at ashgrove special school in penarth in the vale of glamorgan .
" she 'd done a pe lesson .

" although it 's a rare thing to happen it does happen and people need to understand that and live their lives accordingly . "

in a series of articles from interested parties supporting and opposed to the ban , simon clark , director of the freedom organisation for the right to enjoy smoking tobacco -lrb- forest -rrb- , raises concerns over its impact .
mr clark believes the law will have repercussions for business and that it treats adults like children . "
forest opposed legislation to ban smoking in all indoor public places and although we have lost this particular battle we will continue to fight the ban and fight for choice .
tobacco is a legal product and as long as smokers do not seriously inconvenience non-smokers it is quite wrong for politicians and anti-smoking lobbyists to target them in such a brutal fashion .
for example , what on earth is wrong with companies providing a designated smoking room for employees ?
or a private members ' club choosing to allow people to smoke on their premises ?
time will tell what impact the ban will have in scotland , but ireland is probably a good guide .
the vast majority of people are law-abiding so do n't expect mass disobedience .
there will , however , be considerable grumbling about a law that treats adults like children , denies freedom of choice to millions , and has to be enforced by tobacco control officers who actively encourage members of the public to grass on their fellow citizens . "
like many anti-smoking initiatives , the ban could actually be counter-productive " since campaigners will almost certainly demand further action against smokers - bans on smoking in parks , cars and beaches , for example - such grumbling wo n't go away .
it will intensify as people realise the extent to which politicians are dictating our daily lives .
pubs and restaurants that can provide a comfortable , well-heated outdoor area for smokers and their friends will probably survive , and some may thrive .
others wo n't be so lucky .
the vintners federation of ireland estimate that many pubs lost 15-25 % of their business and several hundred had to close .
the effect on some rural communities could be enormous .
common sense like many anti-smoking initiatives , the ban could actually be counter-productive .
according to a recent , fascinating report by jerome adda and francesca cornaglia of university college london and the institute of fiscal studies : " smoking bans have on average no effects on non-smokers .
" bans in recreational public places can ... perversely increase their exposure by displacing smokers to private places where they contaminate non-smokers , and in particular young children . "
adda and cornaglia also found that " smoking bans increase the exposure of poorer individuals , while it decreases the exposure of richer individuals , leading to wider health disparities " .
reading that i did n't know whether to laugh or cry .
common sense tells you that while a smoking ban may force -lrb- or encourage -rrb- some people to quit , the overwhelming majority of smokers will continue to light up .
unable to smoke in a well-ventilated bar or restaurant -lrb- or a separate , designated smoking room -rrb- , they will light up outside buildings , in the street and , very likely , at home .
far from giving up , many smokers will reach for their fags in defiance .

legend has it that one out of every five black people on earth is a nigerian .
but that can only be an assumption , for every headcount held in nigeria in the past 30 years has ended in national controversy and with strong allegations of population inflation .
the last census was carried out in 1991 .
its figures - which are regarded only as being marginally less manipulated than the others - put the total population at 88.9 million , almost equally divided between the two sexes .
since then the population has been projected on an annual growth rate of about 2.9 % .
the official projected figure for 2003 was 126 million .
headcount a new census was to have been held between november and december last year .
preparations for it by the national population commission -lrb- npc -rrb- started in 2003 .
why should i be counted ?
it will be the same as what happened in 1991 .
the common man does n't benefit from it madonna h , sokoto , nigeria send us your comments but last july , president olusegun obasanjo delayed the exercise until this coming march .
the official reason given for the postponement was that vital material would not arrive from abroad in time for the headcount to be held as scheduled .
what was not openly acknowledged was the gathering political storm over the type of data to be collected .
the controversy relates to ethnicity and religion .
how many nigerians are muslims and how many are christians ?
what is the strength of each ethnic group in the country ?
traditional and political leaders in the largely muslim northern states announced last year their strong opposition to the inclusion of questions on religious persuasion and ethnicity in the census questionnaire .
the last census was carried out 14 years ago they warned that they would mobilise people in the states against taking part in the census if the questions were included .
but governors of states in the south-east responded with a counter warning - they would mobilise against the headcount in their states if the data to be collected did not include the numerical strengths of every religious and ethnic group .
amidst the growing furore , came the announcement from the npc that it was abandoning the inclusion of the sensitive subjects - although it is not known whether it had made its decision before or after the heated arguments began .
professor jg ottong , a social scientist at the university of calabar , explained that population has been a sensitive and controversial issue " because of its implications for shaping regional , state and ethnic relations and balance of power " .
in the past , census figures were believed to have been manipulated for political advantage .
when nigeria had three regions , the combined population of the two in the south was said to be less than that of the north .
therefore the north was - and still is - assured of absolute control of the federal government .
funds southern leaders claimed at the time that election rigging began at the census level .
their argument was that it ran against all known demographic principles for the largely semi-arid north to be more populated than the coastal south .
and such deep-seated suspicion continues .
the mutual hostilities it engenders are thinly veiled .
each side is struggling for population and , therefore , political advantage .
the distribution of funds which accrue to the nation among the 36 component states is also based largely on population .
if a state is assigned a bloated populace , its draw from the national purse is more than that of those with smaller populations .
this accounts for the sharp interest shown by state governors in how the census is conducted .
in addition to the regional balancing of power on a population basis , there are also the ethnic and religious equations .
the nigerian constitution stipulates that the " federal character " must be reflected in every government appointment .
this means that the relative strengths of every ethnic and religious group must be taken into consideration in determining appointments in the civil service , the armed forces and political institutions .
the " federal character " principle is a very touchy issue in nigeria .
political and community leaders study the personnel composition of every institution of government with a microscope to find a breach of the principle where they are not favoured .
christians across nigeria refuse to accept past census conclusions that they are in a minority to muslims .
on the other hand , muslim leaders always point to the fact of their acknowledged numerical superiority to claim dominance in public institutions .

legend has it that one out of every five black people on earth is a nigerian .
but that can only be an assumption , for every headcount held in nigeria in the past 30 years has ended in national controversy and with strong allegations of population inflation .
the last census was carried out in 1991 .
its figures - which are regarded only as being marginally less manipulated than the others - put the total population at 88.9 million , almost equally divided between the two sexes .
since then the population has been projected on an annual growth rate of about 2.9 % .
the official projected figure for 2003 was 126 million .
headcount a new census was to have been held between november and december last year .
preparations for it by the national population commission -lrb- npc -rrb- started in 2003 .
why should i be counted ?
it will be the same as what happened in 1991 .
the common man does n't benefit from it madonna h , sokoto , nigeria send us your comments but last july , president olusegun obasanjo delayed the exercise until this coming march .
the official reason given for the postponement was that vital material would not arrive from abroad in time for the headcount to be held as scheduled .
what was not openly acknowledged was the gathering political storm over the type of data to be collected .
the controversy relates to ethnicity and religion .
how many nigerians are muslims and how many are christians ?
what is the strength of each ethnic group in the country ?
traditional and political leaders in the largely muslim northern states announced last year their strong opposition to the inclusion of questions on religious persuasion and ethnicity in the census questionnaire .
the last census was carried out 14 years ago they warned that they would mobilise people in the states against taking part in the census if the questions were included .
but governors of states in the south-east responded with a counter warning - they would mobilise against the headcount in their states if the data to be collected did not include the numerical strengths of every religious and ethnic group .
amidst the growing furore , came the announcement from the npc that it was abandoning the inclusion of the sensitive subjects - although it is not known whether it had made its decision before or after the heated arguments began .
professor jg ottong , a social scientist at the university of calabar , explained that population has been a sensitive and controversial issue " because of its implications for shaping regional , state and ethnic relations and balance of power " .
in the past , census figures were believed to have been manipulated for political advantage .
when nigeria had three regions , the combined population of the two in the south was said to be less than that of the north .
therefore the north was - and still is - assured of absolute control of the federal government .
funds southern leaders claimed at the time that election rigging began at the census level .
their argument was that it ran against all known demographic principles for the largely semi-arid north to be more populated than the coastal south .
and such deep-seated suspicion continues .
the mutual hostilities it engenders are thinly veiled .
each side is struggling for population and , therefore , political advantage .
the distribution of funds which accrue to the nation among the 36 component states is also based largely on population .
if a state is assigned a bloated populace , its draw from the national purse is more than that of those with smaller populations .
this accounts for the sharp interest shown by state governors in how the census is conducted .
in addition to the regional balancing of power on a population basis , there are also the ethnic and religious equations .
the nigerian constitution stipulates that the " federal character " must be reflected in every government appointment .
this means that the relative strengths of every ethnic and religious group must be taken into consideration in determining appointments in the civil service , the armed forces and political institutions .
the " federal character " principle is a very touchy issue in nigeria .
political and community leaders study the personnel composition of every institution of government with a microscope to find a breach of the principle where they are not favoured .
christians across nigeria refuse to accept past census conclusions that they are in a minority to muslims .
on the other hand , muslim leaders always point to the fact of their acknowledged numerical superiority to claim dominance in public institutions .

kenneth farr , 37 , died in 2002 , when an unsecured car park barrier smashed through his car windscreen at the asda store in cardiff bay .
an inquest jury found that mr farr from penarth had been unlawfully killed .
south wales police said that a review into the case will be undertaken following the jury 's verdict .
detective superintendent dave bishop , of south wales police , said the investigation team would look again at the evidence .
" in view of the verdict of unlawful killing , the crown prosecution service , south wales police and the local environmental health department will review the sufficiency of the evidence , and consider any future prosecution , " he said .
" our thoughts remain with the family of mr farr at this time . "
ken has missed the first words of his youngest daughter and the first day at school of another helen farr mr farr , an electronics engineer , who had gone to the store to buy a garden shed , was travelling with his three-year-old daughter at the time of the incident .
she was unharmed .
but his widow , helen , has said that the loss of her husband and the father of three had been " difficult " for the family .
" my husband 's death was pointless and futile and totally avoidable , " she said .
" ken was a lovely family man who totally idolised his daughters and has been greatly missed since this happened .
" it 's been difficult to get through but we have had to do it for the children .
" but ken has missed the first words of his youngest daughter and the first day at school of another . "
the youngest of mr farr 's three daughters was in the car she said that now when she drives around she notices car park barriers to see whether they are properly secure .
" really , these gates are lethal and should not be in existence .
they should be removed , especially if people do not pay any attention to securing them , " she said .
" the next thing now really from our viewpoint is the prosecution of asda . "
but asda has said it intends to seek a judicial review to reverse the verdict of unlawful killing reached by the inquest jury .
the company has said that it believed the jury should not have been given the option of unlawful killing .
" in the light of this meticulous investigation , it is simply unjust that the inquest jury were permitted to consider an unlawful killing verdict - especially as an inquest is designed to find out facts , not apportion blame , " said nick agarwal from asda .
" we are just as upset today at the tragic death of mr farr as we were in 2002 , " " we continue to express our sympathies to mrs farr and her family . "
the padlock on the barrier was broken , the inquest heard the cardiff inquest , which lasted for two weeks , heard how mr farr was hit on the head when a swing steel barrier was blown into the path of his car by a gust of wind as he drove into the supermarket car park .
it crashed through his windscreen striking him on the head before going through the driver 's side window .
he was pronounced dead in hospital following the incident .
the jury heard how the barrier in the car park had not been properly secured and witnesses reported seeing it swinging in the wind .
the court also heard about two similar incidents at other asda stores when barriers had struck cars , and in one case asda was fined for breaching health and safety regulations .
since the accident , all similar security barriers have been removed from asda car parks throughout the uk , the inquest was told .

" our thoughts remain with the family of mr farr at this time . "
" ken has missed the first words of his youngest daughter and the first day at school of another " helen farr mr farr , an electronics engineer , who had gone to the store to buy a garden shed , was travelling with his three-year-old daughter at the time of the incident .
she was unharmed .
but his widow , helen , has said that the loss of her husband and the father of three had been " difficult " for the family .
" my husband 's death was pointless and futile and totally avoidable , " she said .
" ken was a lovely family man who totally idolised his daughters and has been greatly missed since this happened .
" it 's been difficult to get through but we have had to do it for the children .
" but ken has missed the first words of his youngest daughter and the first day at school of another . "
she said that now when she drives around she notices car park barriers to see whether they are properly secure .
" really , these gates are lethal and should not be in existence .
they should be removed , especially if people do not pay any attention to securing them , " she said .
" the next thing now really from our viewpoint is the prosecution of asda . "
but asda has said it intends to seek a judicial review to reverse the verdict of unlawful killing reached by the inquest jury .
the company has said that it believed the jury should not have been given the option of unlawful killing .
" in the light of this meticulous investigation , it is simply unjust that the inquest jury were permitted to consider an unlawful killing verdict - especially as an inquest is designed to find out facts , not apportion blame , " said nick agarwal from asda .
" we are just as upset today at the tragic death of mr farr as we were in 2002 , " " we continue to express our sympathies to mrs farr and her family . "
the cardiff inquest , which lasted for two weeks , heard how mr farr was hit on the head when a swing steel barrier was blown into the path of his car by a gust of wind as he drove into the supermarket car park .
it crashed through his windscreen striking him on the head before going through the driver 's side window .
he was pronounced dead in hospital following the incident .
the jury heard how the barrier in the car park had not been properly secured and witnesses reported seeing it swinging in the wind .
the court also heard about two similar incidents at other asda stores when barriers had struck cars , and in one case asda was fined for breaching health and safety regulations .
since the accident , all similar security barriers have been removed from asda car parks throughout the uk , the inquest was told .

she was strongly criticised in the press after it emerged that foreign ministry pressure had led to the closure of a far-right party 's website .
the site had been due to publish the cartoons , which sparked a furore after their initial publication in denmark .
she was also criticised over the swedish response to the asian tsunami , in which about 500 swedes died .
ms freivalds resigned just six months before an election in sweden , in which the ruling social democrats face a resurgent opposition .
" under the current circumstances i find it impossible to conduct my work and therefore choose to resign , " ms freivalds said at a joint news conference with prime minister goran persson .
" it was her own decision , " mr persson said after her announcement .
he said deputy prime minister bosse ringholm would take over as foreign minister temporarily .
ms freivalds was rounded on by the press when a far-right website was forced to close on 9 february , after a foreign ministry official contacted the site 's hosting company .
critics said this was an intrusion on freedom of speech .
the minister said she did not order the official to contact the company , but a later report from the ministry said she was involved in the decision .

" we should now , however , be focusing on trying to reduce exposure to problematic chemicals . "
jamie page , chairman of the cancer prevention and education society , which campaigns to reduce exposure to potentially cancer-causing chemicals , said : " this research is very important and suggests that there are links between chemicals and cancer . "
but professor john toy , cancer research uk medical director , said : " people should not be alarmed by this study .
" it is a review of previously reported research and does not present new findings .
" the authors suggest that it is feasible that certain chemicals could be a factor in causing cancer but do not find compelling scientific evidence to prove a link . "
rosie dodds , of the national childbirth trust said : " while there is reason for parents to be concerned about the level of chemicals their baby is exposed to , it is wrong to suggest that women who are breastfeeding , or who plan to breastfeed , should be more concerned , or indeed refrain from breastfeeding their baby , because of worry about levels of chemicals and pesticides in breastmilk .

an undercover investigation reveals the secret world of estate agents ' dirty tricks .
my boss congratulates me on getting an offer on a flat that has been overvalued by £ 60,000 .
the newly-wed young couple viewing the property are stretched to their financial limit .
but my manager is happy .
he takes me aside and explains how to convince a surveyor that the flat in london 's fashionable notting hill is worth more than it is .
he calls it " slightly simmering " - i call it cooking the books .
the scenario is not uncommon , in fact the manager himself boasts : " this kind of s * * * happens all the time ... that 's why we estate agents are here . "
that night i head to the weekly sales meeting at sloane square .
it 's held at 7pm on a friday night - when other people are relaxing in the pub .
heckled under-performers are heckled and those who have done the most deals are applauded and given champagne and £ 50 .
young agents in foxtons exchange high-fives as they swap tales of gazumping and over-valuing .
i 'm unaccustomed to a sales environment , but when i tell one of the directors that failure is not an option , he looks thrilled the ambitious young graduates in sharp suits are full of bravado as they discuss their equally sharp practices while their sales figures are projected onto a giant screen .
but i ca n't stop thinking back to the hard-working young family who dream of getting on the property ladder and have wasted their money unnecessarily .
for bbc one 's whistleblower programme , i spent eight months investigating the murky world of the estate agent .
this involved spending time in five very different agencies and within days , i got a shocking glimpse inside this largely unregulated industry .
going to war during the investigation i saw the depths to which some agents will sink to get a deal - not only offering a house and a mortgage , but also a fake british passport .
an estate agent was also able to obtain a false passport together with a bbc colleague , emma clarke , i spent three months in foxtons .
londoners will know the brand by its ubiquitous fleet of branded minis and the trendy high-street offices that look more like wine bars than estate agencies .
but behind the stylish facade it is easy to see why the company has made its owner jon hunt one of the wealthiest estate agents in britain .
i 'm told he encourages his agents to adopt the mantra : " our clients expect us to go to war for them ! " - so it 's hardly surprising the lengths his staff will go to keep the deals coming in .
according to the sunday times rich list , jon hunt is worth £ 345m and also owns independent mortgage brokers alexander hall .
unlawful i soon discovered his mortgage brokers work closely with foxtons ' agents .
they openly discuss potential buyers ' budgets so they can squeeze as much money out of them as possible .
jon hunt , head of foxtons , where the undercover reporter worked some buyers have no idea that the foxtons agents showing them around properties already know exactly what they can afford .
after an excruciatingly intense two-hour job interview and presentation with 20 other young hopefuls - i got the job .
i have a cover story but i 'm still nervous when i 'm quizzed for 20 minutes about my work history and squirm as i reel off what i think they want to hear .
i 'm unaccustomed to a sales environment , but when i tell one of the directors that " failure is not an option " , he looks thrilled .
two days later i got the job .
pressure i was posted to the notting hill branch , a former pasta restaurant where jon hunt started his foxtons empire 24 years ago .
i was convinced my cover could be blown at any time as i worked round the corner from where i live .
my friends did n't know about my new day job , and i felt exposed as i zipped around my neighbourhood in my foxtons mini .
it 's a punishing regime and the pressure is palpable working undercover is exhausting .
i have to start at dawn , making sure my cameras are working and well-hidden .
estate agents are a well-turned-out bunch and it 's a struggle to make sure my two cameras are concealed .
life as an estate agent is arduous .
we work six days a week , 12 hours a day .
we work together and socialise together , but we are also pitted against one another as we battle for deals .
it 's a punishing regime and the pressure is palpable .
some foxtons agents earn a basic salary of £ 10,000 - nowhere near enough to live in this trendy hub of west london populated by city high-fliers and celebrities .
the company demand that you live close to your office and they tell you it should take no longer than 40 minutes to get to work .
clinching a deal is a necessity if you are to survive , and some agents will do whatever it takes .
faking documents in another foxtons office , lettings staff jump up and down in delight after they successfully fake a signature on an absent landlord 's paperwork .
faking documents is something of a habit in the st john 's wood office , where emma clarke worked undercover in the lettings department .
i was shocked when she played me her secret footage which showed staff cutting , pasting and gluing signatures onto contracts .
they call it " chop chop " .
relentless nothing prepared me for working at foxtons .
it 's not just a job - it 's a way of life .
rewards include booze-filled weekends away with management and a weekly breakfast club where you have the dubious pleasure of dining at 7.30am with your bosses .
the staff are young and keen and usually straight out of university - happy to get a job and drive a company car the pressure is relentless and even on your one day off , your company mobile buzzes as head office texts you new property details .
staff turnover is high and new recruits quickly burn out .
the staff are young and keen and usually straight out of university - happy to get a job and drive a company car .
i spoke to a number of former employees who told me about the intense pressure and how it made agents behave .
only one former employee would help us with our investigation , and even he refused to waive his anonymity because he too feared reprisals .
when we revealed our findings to jon hunt , his lawyers threatened emma and me with personal lawsuits and even hand-delivered letters to our homes .
if they thought this would deter us from showing how his company works , they were wrong .
lying the undercover team also worked in a very different agency called time2move .
the company 's three small offices are a far cry from the upmarket locations favoured by jon hunt .
but some of the practices are not dissimilar .
the maverick owner of t2m , bruce burkitt , was fined last year by the office of fair trading after he failed to disclose that a member of his family had purchased a property .
so i went to see if the agency had cleaned up its act .
i got a job and within an hour of joining t2m , i was shown exactly how they sold their properties .
it was simple .
once they value a property and get the owner to use their services , they then lie about offers they have n't had .
then after a while , when the owner is utterly desperate to sell , they make up false offers well below the original valuation so the owner reduces the price .
the manager called it " price reduction hour " and " vendor care " - everyone else calls it lying .
there was no way i could join in with this " vendor care " and i was n't sure how long i would be able to maintain my cover .
t2m were on high alert .
something had made the manager jumpy and when i questioned the need to lie , he got suspicious and asked what newspaper i worked for .
his paranoia led to him reading one of my text messages - this time i was sacked .
backhanders i then joined ranks with a property developer who taught me some other tricks of the trade .
it was n't long before i found agents asking for cash backhanders in return for cheating owners out of tens of thousands of pounds .
he told me lots of agents would take a cash bung in return for getting properties at knock-down prices .
after just a few days trawling the high street agencies , we found one unscrupulous agent who asked for a £ 10,000 backhander to cheat a pensioner out of more than £ 50,000 .
the manager of a chard estate agency branch in fulham , west london , showed us round a flat worth more than £ 190,000 .
yet if our developer was happy to grease his palm to the tune of £ 10,000 , he 'd tell the owner to take the offer of £ 140,000 .
deception months later , we found an agent willing to go to even further .
i was totally shocked when we were offered a fake identity in order to get a fraudulent mortgage .
we visited primetime mortgage and property in north london and within minutes of our meeting we were offered a fake british passport , p60 forms and forged utility bills .
i still was n't convinced that he 'd be able to come through with the passport .
but after one more meeting and £ 550 , we had a fake british passport in my name .
perhaps , like in the united states , estate agents should be required to have a qualification when we embarked upon the investigation , i would never have suspected that an estate agent would go to such lengths to make a sale .
there are more than 12,000 registered estate agencies in the uk , and not all of them are as murky as the ones i came across .
but during my eight-month investigation , i discovered a litany of dishonesty , deception , deceit and outright criminality .
the industry desperately needs better regulation and perhaps , like in the united states , estate agents should be required to have a qualification other than a sharp suit .
in response to the reports of the whistleblower programme , foxtons said : " foxtons limited and alexander hall limited pride themselves on the professionalism and transparency of their respective businesses and has the utmost respect for the needs of its client and will always act in the client 's best interest .
" foxtons has in place a rigorous training process , during which its employees are told repeatedly of their statutory and contractual duties , and the high standards expected of them . "
the programme also contacted time2move about their manager .
he said : " i have no knowledge of your accusations and i have not acted inappropriately " .
he also stated that t2m does not , and has never held a " price reduction hour " .
the chard estate agency said : " we are shocked at these allegations and are grateful to the bbc for bringing them to our attention .
on learning of them , we 've taken immediate action to question the individual involved and then to suspend him .
we are now conducting a full investigation of the circumstances . "
a spokesman for primetime mortgage and property said that a member of staff had been suspended while the matter was being fully investigated , and that they were not aware of any illegal practices .
he said the company prided itself on providing an efficient , honest and high standard of service to its clients .
whistleblower is broadcast on bbc one , tuesday 21 march , 2100 gmt .
add your comments on this story , using the form below .
i have worked as a mortgage broker and i was appalled at the practices estate agents use to secure sales and their own income .
as a mortgage broker i could literally have been imprisoned for not looking after the interests of my clients , so how come estate agents can get away with it ?
in this day and age , unregulated estate agency is a complete anomaly and it 's time the government took action !
the mortgage man , chatham having been in estate agency in london for over eight years , i can confirm that this sort of thing goes on a hell of a lot in the industry .
during my time i have come across numerous negotiators who will happily sit on the phone and blatantly lie about what interest their property has been getting , putting forward ridiculously low offers that do n't exist in order to bring the price down and eventually achieve a quick and undervalued deal .
managers too have happily condoned this approach , and in some cases have often over-valued a property to give false hope to the owner and to beat the opposition to the property , only for them to then focus on offers in some cases 40 % less than the asking price .
mr smith , london i too have been at the sharp end of estate agent malpractice .
had my father not personally known the owner of the property i now own , we would never have known the estate agent was withholding our offer .
this same estate agent had also conspired to defraud a friend years ago , withholding offers .
she only found out when she got a friend to put in a fake offer and it was n't passed on .
i also have a builder friend who told me it is common practice for estate agents to take ' bungs ' to lower the price on a property .
i will never trust an estate agent again .
chris , hartlepool an agent tried to get more money out of me after finding out what mortgage i was getting from " independent " financial advisor who worked at the same office .
steve , exeter when i sold my london flat i got four estate agents to value it .
there was a 22 % difference between the lowest and highest quotes which made me quite suspicious of some of the methods which might be employed by the company at the expensive end of the scale .
i still have sleepless nights thinking about the poor person who eventually bought it as i know they paid far too much .
but as long as the industry continues to largely unregulated what is the individual to do , other than attempt to protect their own interests ?
ian , kingston seems to me that a complete overhaul of the way in which we buy and sell property is needed with a view to eliminating the involvement of the estate agent from the financial elements of the transaction .
martin stanton , lutterworth it 's incredible that in britain consumers have more rights when they buy a toaster than they do when they buy a house - probably the biggest purchase they will ever make .
the industry needs reforming and regulating and fraudulent practices must be punished with prison sentences just like any other sort of fraud .
hopefully the investigation done by anna and emma will bring this about very soon .
michael jamieson i worked for a large , nationwide chain of estate agents for a number of years .
there was always rigourous training and , to my knowledege , none of the above scams were carried out .
the industry needs regulating with stiff fines for non-compliers .
sam , hull the behaviour in this " self regulated " industry can only be changed through punitive fines because it is all about money for the agents .
recently had my accepted offer gazumped through the activity of unscrupulous estate agent .
gazumped , reading as a first time buyer i was unfortunate to have experienced the way estate agents operate .
they acted more like con-men rather than estate agents .

i was convinced my cover could be blown at any time as i worked round the corner from where i live .
my friends did n't know about my new day job , and i felt exposed as i zipped around my neighbourhood in my foxtons mini .
it 's a punishing regime and the pressure is palpable working undercover is exhausting .
i have to start at dawn , making sure my cameras are working and well-hidden .
estate agents are a well-turned-out bunch and it 's a struggle to make sure my two cameras are concealed .
life as an estate agent is arduous .
we work six days a week , 12 hours a day .
we work together and socialise together , but we are also pitted against one another as we battle for deals .
it 's a punishing regime and the pressure is palpable .
some foxtons agents earn a basic salary of £ 10,000 - nowhere near enough to live in this trendy hub of west london populated by city high-fliers and celebrities .

the staff are young and keen and usually straight out of university - happy to get a job and drive a company car .
i spoke to a number of former employees who told me about the intense pressure and how it made agents behave .
only one former employee would help us with our investigation , and even he refused to waive his anonymity because he too feared reprisals .
when we revealed our findings to jon hunt , his lawyers threatened emma and me with personal lawsuits and even hand-delivered letters to our homes .
if they thought this would deter us from showing how his company works , they were wrong .
lying the undercover team also worked in a very different agency called time2move .
the company 's three small offices are a far cry from the upmarket locations favoured by jon hunt .
but some of the practices are not dissimilar .
the maverick owner of t2m , bruce burkitt , was fined last year by the office of fair trading after he failed to disclose that a member of his family had purchased a property .
so i went to see if the agency had cleaned up its act .
i got a job and within an hour of joining t2m , i was shown exactly how they sold their properties .
it was simple .
once they value a property and get the owner to use their services , they then lie about offers they have n't had .
then after a while , when the owner is utterly desperate to sell , they make up false offers well below the original valuation so the owner reduces the price .
the manager called it " price reduction hour " and " vendor care " - everyone else calls it lying .
there was no way i could join in with this " vendor care " and i was n't sure how long i would be able to maintain my cover .
t2m were on high alert .
something had made the manager jumpy and when i questioned the need to lie , he got suspicious and asked what newspaper i worked for .
his paranoia led to him reading one of my text messages - this time i was sacked .
backhanders i then joined ranks with a property developer who taught me some other tricks of the trade .
it was n't long before i found agents asking for cash backhanders in return for cheating owners out of tens of thousands of pounds .
he told me lots of agents would take a cash bung in return for getting properties at knock-down prices .
after just a few days trawling the high street agencies , we found one unscrupulous agent who asked for a £ 10,000 backhander to cheat a pensioner out of more than £ 50,000 .
the manager of a chard estate agency branch in fulham , west london , showed us round a flat worth more than £ 190,000 .
yet if our developer was happy to grease his palm to the tune of £ 10,000 , he 'd tell the owner to take the offer of £ 140,000 .
deception months later , we found an agent willing to go to even further .
i was totally shocked when we were offered a fake identity in order to get a fraudulent mortgage .
we visited primetime mortgage and property in north london and within minutes of our meeting we were offered a fake british passport , p60 forms and forged utility bills .
i still was n't convinced that he 'd be able to come through with the passport .
but after one more meeting and £ 550 , we had a fake british passport in my name .
perhaps , like in the united states , estate agents should be required to have a qualification when we embarked upon the investigation , i would never have suspected that an estate agent would go to such lengths to make a sale .
there are more than 12,000 registered estate agencies in the uk , and not all of them are as murky as the ones i came across .
but during my eight-month investigation , i discovered a litany of dishonesty , deception , deceit and outright criminality .
the industry desperately needs better regulation and perhaps , like in the united states , estate agents should be required to have a qualification other than a sharp suit .
in response to the reports of the whistleblower programme , foxtons said : " foxtons limited and alexander hall limited pride themselves on the professionalism and transparency of their respective businesses and has the utmost respect for the needs of its client and will always act in the client 's best interest .
" foxtons has in place a rigorous training process , during which its employees are told repeatedly of their statutory and contractual duties , and the high standards expected of them . "
the programme also contacted time2move about their manager .
he said : " i have no knowledge of your accusations and i have not acted inappropriately " .
he also stated that t2m does not , and has never held a " price reduction hour " .
the chard estate agency said : " we are shocked at these allegations and are grateful to the bbc for bringing them to our attention .
on learning of them , we 've taken immediate action to question the individual involved and then to suspend him .
we are now conducting a full investigation of the circumstances . "
a spokesman for primetime mortgage and property said that a member of staff had been suspended while the matter was being fully investigated , and that they were not aware of any illegal practices .
he said the company prided itself on providing an efficient , honest and high standard of service to its clients .
whistleblower is broadcast on bbc one , tuesday 21 march , 2100 gmt .

i have worked as a mortgage broker and i was appalled at the practices estate agents use to secure sales and their own income .
as a mortgage broker i could literally have been imprisoned for not looking after the interests of my clients , so how come estate agents can get away with it ?
in this day and age , unregulated estate agency is a complete anomaly and it 's time the government took action !
the mortgage man , chatham having been in estate agency in london for over eight years , i can confirm that this sort of thing goes on a hell of a lot in the industry .
during my time i have come across numerous negotiators who will happily sit on the phone and blatantly lie about what interest their property has been getting , putting forward ridiculously low offers that do n't exist in order to bring the price down and eventually achieve a quick and undervalued deal .
managers too have happily condoned this approach , and in some cases have often over-valued a property to give false hope to the owner and to beat the opposition to the property , only for them to then focus on offers in some cases 40 % less than the asking price .
mr smith , london i too have been at the sharp end of estate agent malpractice .
had my father not personally known the owner of the property i now own , we would never have known the estate agent was withholding our offer .
this same estate agent had also conspired to defraud a friend years ago , withholding offers .
she only found out when she got a friend to put in a fake offer and it was n't passed on .
i also have a builder friend who told me it is common practice for estate agents to take ' bungs ' to lower the price on a property .
i will never trust an estate agent again .
chris , hartlepool an agent tried to get more money out of me after finding out what mortgage i was getting from " independent " financial advisor who worked at the same office .
steve , exeter when i sold my london flat i got four estate agents to value it .
there was a 22 % difference between the lowest and highest quotes which made me quite suspicious of some of the methods which might be employed by the company at the expensive end of the scale .
i still have sleepless nights thinking about the poor person who eventually bought it as i know they paid far too much .
but as long as the industry continues to largely unregulated what is the individual to do , other than attempt to protect their own interests ?
ian , kingston seems to me that a complete overhaul of the way in which we buy and sell property is needed with a view to eliminating the involvement of the estate agent from the financial elements of the transaction .
martin stanton , lutterworth it 's incredible that in britain consumers have more rights when they buy a toaster than they do when they buy a house - probably the biggest purchase they will ever make .
the industry needs reforming and regulating and fraudulent practices must be punished with prison sentences just like any other sort of fraud .
hopefully the investigation done by anna and emma will bring this about very soon .
michael jamieson i worked for a large , nationwide chain of estate agents for a number of years .
there was always rigourous training and , to my knowledege , none of the above scams were carried out .
the industry needs regulating with stiff fines for non-compliers .
sam , hull the behaviour in this " self regulated " industry can only be changed through punitive fines because it is all about money for the agents .
recently had my accepted offer gazumped through the activity of unscrupulous estate agent .
gazumped , reading as a first time buyer i was unfortunate to have experienced the way estate agents operate .
they acted more like con-men rather than estate agents .

i 'm unaccustomed to a sales environment , but when i tell one of the directors that " failure is not an option " , he looks thrilled .
two days later i got the job .
pressure i was posted to the notting hill branch , a former pasta restaurant where jon hunt started his foxtons empire 24 years ago .
i was convinced my cover could be blown at any time as i worked round the corner from where i live .
my friends did n't know about my new day job , and i felt exposed as i zipped around my neighbourhood in my foxtons mini .
it 's a punishing regime and the pressure is palpable working undercover is exhausting .
i have to start at dawn , making sure my cameras are working and well-hidden .
estate agents are a well-turned-out bunch and it 's a struggle to make sure my two cameras are concealed .
life as an estate agent is arduous .
we work six days a week , 12 hours a day .
we work together and socialise together , but we are also pitted against one another as we battle for deals .
it 's a punishing regime and the pressure is palpable .
some foxtons agents earn a basic salary of £ 10,000 - nowhere near enough to live in this trendy hub of west london populated by city high-fliers and celebrities .
the company demand that you live close to your office and they tell you it should take no longer than 40 minutes to get to work .
clinching a deal is a necessity if you are to survive , and some agents will do whatever it takes .
faking documents in another foxtons office , lettings staff jump up and down in delight after they successfully fake a signature on an absent landlord 's paperwork .
faking documents is something of a habit in the st john 's wood office , where emma clarke worked undercover in the lettings department .
i was shocked when she played me her secret footage which showed staff cutting , pasting and gluing signatures onto contracts .
they call it " chop chop " .
relentless nothing prepared me for working at foxtons .
it 's not just a job - it 's a way of life .
rewards include booze-filled weekends away with management and a weekly breakfast club where you have the dubious pleasure of dining at 7.30am with your bosses .
the staff are young and keen and usually straight out of university - happy to get a job and drive a company car the pressure is relentless and even on your one day off , your company mobile buzzes as head office texts you new property details .
staff turnover is high and new recruits quickly burn out .
the staff are young and keen and usually straight out of university - happy to get a job and drive a company car .
i spoke to a number of former employees who told me about the intense pressure and how it made agents behave .
only one former employee would help us with our investigation , and even he refused to waive his anonymity because he too feared reprisals .
when we revealed our findings to jon hunt , his lawyers threatened emma and me with personal lawsuits and even hand-delivered letters to our homes .
if they thought this would deter us from showing how his company works , they were wrong .
lying the undercover team also worked in a very different agency called time2move .
the company 's three small offices are a far cry from the upmarket locations favoured by jon hunt .
but some of the practices are not dissimilar .
the maverick owner of t2m , bruce burkitt , was fined last year by the office of fair trading after he failed to disclose that a member of his family had purchased a property .
so i went to see if the agency had cleaned up its act .
i got a job and within an hour of joining t2m , i was shown exactly how they sold their properties .
it was simple .
once they value a property and get the owner to use their services , they then lie about offers they have n't had .
then after a while , when the owner is utterly desperate to sell , they make up false offers well below the original valuation so the owner reduces the price .
the manager called it " price reduction hour " and " vendor care " - everyone else calls it lying .
there was no way i could join in with this " vendor care " and i was n't sure how long i would be able to maintain my cover .
t2m were on high alert .
something had made the manager jumpy and when i questioned the need to lie , he got suspicious and asked what newspaper i worked for .
his paranoia led to him reading one of my text messages - this time i was sacked .
backhanders i then joined ranks with a property developer who taught me some other tricks of the trade .
it was n't long before i found agents asking for cash backhanders in return for cheating owners out of tens of thousands of pounds .
he told me lots of agents would take a cash bung in return for getting properties at knock-down prices .
after just a few days trawling the high street agencies , we found one unscrupulous agent who asked for a £ 10,000 backhander to cheat a pensioner out of more than £ 50,000 .
the manager of a chard estate agency branch in fulham , west london , showed us round a flat worth more than £ 190,000 .
yet if our developer was happy to grease his palm to the tune of £ 10,000 , he 'd tell the owner to take the offer of £ 140,000 .
deception months later , we found an agent willing to go to even further .
i was totally shocked when we were offered a fake identity in order to get a fraudulent mortgage .
we visited primetime mortgage and property in north london and within minutes of our meeting we were offered a fake british passport , p60 forms and forged utility bills .
i still was n't convinced that he 'd be able to come through with the passport .
but after one more meeting and £ 550 , we had a fake british passport in my name .
perhaps , like in the united states , estate agents should be required to have a qualification when we embarked upon the investigation , i would never have suspected that an estate agent would go to such lengths to make a sale .
there are more than 12,000 registered estate agencies in the uk , and not all of them are as murky as the ones i came across .
but during my eight-month investigation , i discovered a litany of dishonesty , deception , deceit and outright criminality .
the industry desperately needs better regulation and perhaps , like in the united states , estate agents should be required to have a qualification other than a sharp suit .
in response to the reports of the whistleblower programme , foxtons said : " foxtons limited and alexander hall limited pride themselves on the professionalism and transparency of their respective businesses and has the utmost respect for the needs of its client and will always act in the client 's best interest .
" foxtons has in place a rigorous training process , during which its employees are told repeatedly of their statutory and contractual duties , and the high standards expected of them . "
the programme also contacted time2move about their manager .
he said : " i have no knowledge of your accusations and i have not acted inappropriately " .
he also stated that t2m does not , and has never held a " price reduction hour " .
the chard estate agency said : " we are shocked at these allegations and are grateful to the bbc for bringing them to our attention .
on learning of them , we 've taken immediate action to question the individual involved and then to suspend him .
we are now conducting a full investigation of the circumstances . "
a spokesman for primetime mortgage and property said that a member of staff had been suspended while the matter was being fully investigated , and that they were not aware of any illegal practices .
he said the company prided itself on providing an efficient , honest and high standard of service to its clients .
whistleblower is broadcast on bbc one , tuesday 21 march , 2100 gmt .

i have worked as a mortgage broker and i was appalled at the practices estate agents use to secure sales and their own income .
as a mortgage broker i could literally have been imprisoned for not looking after the interests of my clients , so how come estate agents can get away with it ?
in this day and age , unregulated estate agency is a complete anomaly and it 's time the government took action !
the mortgage man , chatham having been in estate agency in london for over eight years , i can confirm that this sort of thing goes on a hell of a lot in the industry .
during my time i have come across numerous negotiators who will happily sit on the phone and blatantly lie about what interest their property has been getting , putting forward ridiculously low offers that do n't exist in order to bring the price down and eventually achieve a quick and undervalued deal .
managers too have happily condoned this approach , and in some cases have often over-valued a property to give false hope to the owner and to beat the opposition to the property , only for them to then focus on offers in some cases 40 % less than the asking price .
mr smith , london i too have been at the sharp end of estate agent malpractice .
had my father not personally known the owner of the property i now own , we would never have known the estate agent was withholding our offer .
this same estate agent had also conspired to defraud a friend years ago , withholding offers .
she only found out when she got a friend to put in a fake offer and it was n't passed on .
i also have a builder friend who told me it is common practice for estate agents to take ' bungs ' to lower the price on a property .
i will never trust an estate agent again .
chris , hartlepool an agent tried to get more money out of me after finding out what mortgage i was getting from " independent " financial advisor who worked at the same office .
steve , exeter when i sold my london flat i got four estate agents to value it .
there was a 22 % difference between the lowest and highest quotes which made me quite suspicious of some of the methods which might be employed by the company at the expensive end of the scale .
i still have sleepless nights thinking about the poor person who eventually bought it as i know they paid far too much .
but as long as the industry continues to largely unregulated what is the individual to do , other than attempt to protect their own interests ?
ian , kingston seems to me that a complete overhaul of the way in which we buy and sell property is needed with a view to eliminating the involvement of the estate agent from the financial elements of the transaction .
martin stanton , lutterworth it 's incredible that in britain consumers have more rights when they buy a toaster than they do when they buy a house - probably the biggest purchase they will ever make .
the industry needs reforming and regulating and fraudulent practices must be punished with prison sentences just like any other sort of fraud .
hopefully the investigation done by anna and emma will bring this about very soon .
michael jamieson i worked for a large , nationwide chain of estate agents for a number of years .
there was always rigourous training and , to my knowledege , none of the above scams were carried out .
the industry needs regulating with stiff fines for non-compliers .
sam , hull the behaviour in this " self regulated " industry can only be changed through punitive fines because it is all about money for the agents .
recently had my accepted offer gazumped through the activity of unscrupulous estate agent .
gazumped , reading as a first time buyer i was unfortunate to have experienced the way estate agents operate .
they acted more like con-men rather than estate agents .

an undercover investigation reveals the secret world of estate agents ' dirty tricks .
my boss congratulates me on getting an offer on a flat that has been overvalued by £ 60,000 .
the newly-wed young couple viewing the property are stretched to their financial limit .
but my manager is happy .
he takes me aside and explains how to convince a surveyor that the flat in london 's fashionable notting hill is worth more than it is .
he calls it " slightly simmering " - i call it cooking the books .
the scenario is not uncommon , in fact the manager himself boasts : " this kind of s * * * happens all the time ... that 's why we estate agents are here . "
that night i head to the weekly sales meeting at sloane square .
it 's held at 7pm on a friday night - when other people are relaxing in the pub .

for bbc one 's whistleblower programme , i spent eight months investigating the murky world of the estate agent .

the staff are young and keen and usually straight out of university - happy to get a job and drive a company car .
i spoke to a number of former employees who told me about the intense pressure and how it made agents behave .
only one former employee would help us with our investigation , and even he refused to waive his anonymity because he too feared reprisals .
when we revealed our findings to jon hunt , his lawyers threatened emma and me with personal lawsuits and even hand-delivered letters to our homes .
if they thought this would deter us from showing how his company works , they were wrong .
lying the undercover team also worked in a very different agency called time2move .
the company 's three small offices are a far cry from the upmarket locations favoured by jon hunt .
but some of the practices are not dissimilar .
the maverick owner of t2m , bruce burkitt , was fined last year by the office of fair trading after he failed to disclose that a member of his family had purchased a property .
so i went to see if the agency had cleaned up its act .
i got a job and within an hour of joining t2m , i was shown exactly how they sold their properties .
it was simple .
once they value a property and get the owner to use their services , they then lie about offers they have n't had .
then after a while , when the owner is utterly desperate to sell , they make up false offers well below the original valuation so the owner reduces the price .
the manager called it " price reduction hour " and " vendor care " - everyone else calls it lying .
there was no way i could join in with this " vendor care " and i was n't sure how long i would be able to maintain my cover .
t2m were on high alert .
something had made the manager jumpy and when i questioned the need to lie , he got suspicious and asked what newspaper i worked for .
his paranoia led to him reading one of my text messages - this time i was sacked .
backhanders i then joined ranks with a property developer who taught me some other tricks of the trade .
it was n't long before i found agents asking for cash backhanders in return for cheating owners out of tens of thousands of pounds .
he told me lots of agents would take a cash bung in return for getting properties at knock-down prices .
after just a few days trawling the high street agencies , we found one unscrupulous agent who asked for a £ 10,000 backhander to cheat a pensioner out of more than £ 50,000 .
the manager of a chard estate agency branch in fulham , west london , showed us round a flat worth more than £ 190,000 .
yet if our developer was happy to grease his palm to the tune of £ 10,000 , he 'd tell the owner to take the offer of £ 140,000 .
deception months later , we found an agent willing to go to even further .
i was totally shocked when we were offered a fake identity in order to get a fraudulent mortgage .
we visited primetime mortgage and property in north london and within minutes of our meeting we were offered a fake british passport , p60 forms and forged utility bills .
i still was n't convinced that he 'd be able to come through with the passport .
but after one more meeting and £ 550 , we had a fake british passport in my name .
perhaps , like in the united states , estate agents should be required to have a qualification when we embarked upon the investigation , i would never have suspected that an estate agent would go to such lengths to make a sale .
there are more than 12,000 registered estate agencies in the uk , and not all of them are as murky as the ones i came across .
but during my eight-month investigation , i discovered a litany of dishonesty , deception , deceit and outright criminality .
the industry desperately needs better regulation and perhaps , like in the united states , estate agents should be required to have a qualification other than a sharp suit .
in response to the reports of the whistleblower programme , foxtons said : " foxtons limited and alexander hall limited pride themselves on the professionalism and transparency of their respective businesses and has the utmost respect for the needs of its client and will always act in the client 's best interest .
" foxtons has in place a rigorous training process , during which its employees are told repeatedly of their statutory and contractual duties , and the high standards expected of them . "
the programme also contacted time2move about their manager .
he said : " i have no knowledge of your accusations and i have not acted inappropriately " .
he also stated that t2m does not , and has never held a " price reduction hour " .
the chard estate agency said : " we are shocked at these allegations and are grateful to the bbc for bringing them to our attention .
on learning of them , we 've taken immediate action to question the individual involved and then to suspend him .
we are now conducting a full investigation of the circumstances . "
a spokesman for primetime mortgage and property said that a member of staff had been suspended while the matter was being fully investigated , and that they were not aware of any illegal practices .
he said the company prided itself on providing an efficient , honest and high standard of service to its clients .
whistleblower is broadcast on bbc one , tuesday 21 march , 2100 gmt .

i have worked as a mortgage broker and i was appalled at the practices estate agents use to secure sales and their own income .
as a mortgage broker i could literally have been imprisoned for not looking after the interests of my clients , so how come estate agents can get away with it ?
in this day and age , unregulated estate agency is a complete anomaly and it 's time the government took action !
the mortgage man , chatham having been in estate agency in london for over eight years , i can confirm that this sort of thing goes on a hell of a lot in the industry .
during my time i have come across numerous negotiators who will happily sit on the phone and blatantly lie about what interest their property has been getting , putting forward ridiculously low offers that do n't exist in order to bring the price down and eventually achieve a quick and undervalued deal .
managers too have happily condoned this approach , and in some cases have often over-valued a property to give false hope to the owner and to beat the opposition to the property , only for them to then focus on offers in some cases 40 % less than the asking price .
mr smith , london i too have been at the sharp end of estate agent malpractice .
had my father not personally known the owner of the property i now own , we would never have known the estate agent was withholding our offer .
this same estate agent had also conspired to defraud a friend years ago , withholding offers .
she only found out when she got a friend to put in a fake offer and it was n't passed on .
i also have a builder friend who told me it is common practice for estate agents to take ' bungs ' to lower the price on a property .
i will never trust an estate agent again .

an undercover investigation reveals the secret world of estate agents ' dirty tricks .
my boss congratulates me on getting an offer on a flat that has been overvalued by £ 60,000 .
the newly-wed young couple viewing the property are stretched to their financial limit .
but my manager is happy .
he takes me aside and explains how to convince a surveyor that the flat in london 's fashionable notting hill is worth more than it is .
he calls it " slightly simmering " - i call it cooking the books .
the scenario is not uncommon , in fact the manager himself boasts : " this kind of s * * * happens all the time ... that 's why we estate agents are here . "
that night i head to the weekly sales meeting at sloane square .
it 's held at 7pm on a friday night - when other people are relaxing in the pub .
heckled under-performers are heckled and those who have done the most deals are applauded and given champagne and £ 50 .
young agents in foxtons exchange high-fives as they swap tales of gazumping and over-valuing .
i 'm unaccustomed to a sales environment , but when i tell one of the directors that failure is not an option , he looks thrilled the ambitious young graduates in sharp suits are full of bravado as they discuss their equally sharp practices while their sales figures are projected onto a giant screen .
but i ca n't stop thinking back to the hard-working young family who dream of getting on the property ladder and have wasted their money unnecessarily .
for bbc one 's whistleblower programme , i spent eight months investigating the murky world of the estate agent .
this involved spending time in five very different agencies and within days , i got a shocking glimpse inside this largely unregulated industry .
going to war during the investigation i saw the depths to which some agents will sink to get a deal - not only offering a house and a mortgage , but also a fake british passport .
an estate agent was also able to obtain a false passport together with a bbc colleague , emma clarke , i spent three months in foxtons .
londoners will know the brand by its ubiquitous fleet of branded minis and the trendy high-street offices that look more like wine bars than estate agencies .
but behind the stylish facade it is easy to see why the company has made its owner jon hunt one of the wealthiest estate agents in britain .
i 'm told he encourages his agents to adopt the mantra : " our clients expect us to go to war for them ! " - so it 's hardly surprising the lengths his staff will go to keep the deals coming in .
according to the sunday times rich list , jon hunt is worth £ 345m and also owns independent mortgage brokers alexander hall .
unlawful i soon discovered his mortgage brokers work closely with foxtons ' agents .
they openly discuss potential buyers ' budgets so they can squeeze as much money out of them as possible .
jon hunt , head of foxtons , where the undercover reporter worked some buyers have no idea that the foxtons agents showing them around properties already know exactly what they can afford .
after an excruciatingly intense two-hour job interview and presentation with 20 other young hopefuls - i got the job .
i have a cover story but i 'm still nervous when i 'm quizzed for 20 minutes about my work history and squirm as i reel off what i think they want to hear .
i 'm unaccustomed to a sales environment , but when i tell one of the directors that " failure is not an option " , he looks thrilled .
two days later i got the job .
pressure i was posted to the notting hill branch , a former pasta restaurant where jon hunt started his foxtons empire 24 years ago .
i was convinced my cover could be blown at any time as i worked round the corner from where i live .
my friends did n't know about my new day job , and i felt exposed as i zipped around my neighbourhood in my foxtons mini .
it 's a punishing regime and the pressure is palpable working undercover is exhausting .
i have to start at dawn , making sure my cameras are working and well-hidden .
estate agents are a well-turned-out bunch and it 's a struggle to make sure my two cameras are concealed .
life as an estate agent is arduous .
we work six days a week , 12 hours a day .
we work together and socialise together , but we are also pitted against one another as we battle for deals .
it 's a punishing regime and the pressure is palpable .
some foxtons agents earn a basic salary of £ 10,000 - nowhere near enough to live in this trendy hub of west london populated by city high-fliers and celebrities .
the company demand that you live close to your office and they tell you it should take no longer than 40 minutes to get to work .
clinching a deal is a necessity if you are to survive , and some agents will do whatever it takes .
faking documents in another foxtons office , lettings staff jump up and down in delight after they successfully fake a signature on an absent landlord 's paperwork .
faking documents is something of a habit in the st john 's wood office , where emma clarke worked undercover in the lettings department .
i was shocked when she played me her secret footage which showed staff cutting , pasting and gluing signatures onto contracts .
they call it " chop chop " .
relentless nothing prepared me for working at foxtons .
it 's not just a job - it 's a way of life .
rewards include booze-filled weekends away with management and a weekly breakfast club where you have the dubious pleasure of dining at 7.30am with your bosses .
the staff are young and keen and usually straight out of university - happy to get a job and drive a company car the pressure is relentless and even on your one day off , your company mobile buzzes as head office texts you new property details .

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- israelis bring high-tech food to angola bbc news / africa graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 21 march 2006 , 09:55 gmt israelis bring high-tech food to angola by sarah grainger bbc , luanda an israeli company is using the latest water-saving technology to grow fruit and vegetables in angola , which imports much of its food after 27 years of civil war .
" i think angola is experiencing a boom time right now , " says uri ben basat , co-manager of terra verde , a 45-hectare farm outside the capital luanda .
the farm was set up at the end of the war in 2002 and has been harvesting tomatoes , peppers , cucumber , mangoes , melons and grapes for three years .
in fact , the farm produces 35 tonnes of vegetables every week of the year , selling most of this food to supermarkets and restaurants in luanda .
during the war , the agricultural sector was devastated .
bridges were blown up and roads and railways mined , so the food which was grown locally could not be transported to where it was needed .
those who could afford to , came to rely on expensive imports from the rest of the world , rather than food grown within angola .
computer terra verde is a joint angolan-israeli business , but the agricultural expertise comes from europe and israel .
the company has built its own pumping station 6km away on the banks of the river bengo to ensure that its drip-irrigation system , where plants are fed water and fertilizer drip by drip through ground level pipes , would never run dry . "
because of the war there are untold numbers of mines out there and goods and people ca n't move freely " rick corsino wfp country director a computer programme calculates the exact amounts of water needed , depending on temperature and humidity .
different varieties of vegetables are grown both in open fields and greenhouses depending on their suitability to angola 's almost tropical climate .
and the company buys in boxes of bees to pollinate its tomato plants organically .
all this investment came with a price tag of some $ 8m .
the company says the farm is paying its way but will not say how much profit they make or what their turnover is like .
" this is a long-term project , " says marketing manager merav zacharin .
" terra verde is very much our calling card .
we want investors to see what we have done here and realise that we could build the same thing for them somewhere else in angola . "
government help some 200 jobs have already been created and the company is expanding .
another farms has been set up in kwanza sul province , which is 10 times bigger than terra verde at 450 hectares .
" angola is hungry for food now , " says mr ben basat .
" they have an impressive history of agricultural production , lots of good land and water . "
but 27 years of civil war have taken their toll .
" the biggest problem this country has is access to food , " according to wfp country director rick corsino .
" there are certain parts of the country in which most of the food is grown .
because of the war there are untold numbers of mines out there and goods and people ca n't move freely . "
this is why those residents of luanda who can afford to , still rely heavily on expensive imported food and terra verde sees imported vegetables as its main competitor .
a kilo of tomatoes costs about $ 4 in the supermarket , compared to $ 6 for imported produce .
this is not cheap food and the average angolan ca n't afford the produce grown at terra verde .
their market includes large supermarkets , restaurants and the country 's big employers - the oil and diamond companies .
mr ben basat thinks there 's only one way to lower prices considerably in angola .
" in most countries the government assists the agricultural sector .
but here they have n't helped us at all , " he says .
" it 's very expensive to produce here and so the prices are very high .
if they want the prices to go down so that everybody from angola can buy our product , then it needs the power of the government .
i do n't see any other way . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- us senators press china on yuan bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies tuesday , 21 march 2006 , 09:55 gmt us senators press china on yuan a delegation of us senators is visiting beijing , amid a clamour in washington for action over the value of the yuan and its impact on us-chinese trade .
the us senate will vote this month on a bill to impose tariffs of up to 27.5 % on some chinese goods unless beijing moves to free up its currency .
some us politicians believe the yuan is artificially undervalued , letting china sell its products more cheaply abroad .
china has ruled out another revaluation after raising the yuan 's value in july .
' limited progress ' chinese prime minister wen jiabao said recently that beijing would allow greater flexibility in its exchange rate .
however , the bush administration is pressing for more substantial action , believing the yuan 's value is fuelling the growing us trade deficit .
ahead of a series of meetings with senior chinese officials , senator charles schumer said the purpose of the trip was not to deliver ultimatums but to learn about chinese intentions on the issue .

no water is wasted in growing the crops " i think angola is experiencing a boom time right now , " says uri ben basat , co-manager of terra verde , a 45-hectare farm outside the capital luanda .
the farm was set up at the end of the war in 2002 and has been harvesting tomatoes , peppers , cucumber , mangoes , melons and grapes for three years .
in fact , the farm produces 35 tonnes of vegetables every week of the year , selling most of this food to supermarkets and restaurants in luanda .
during the war , the agricultural sector was devastated .
bridges were blown up and roads and railways mined , so the food which was grown locally could not be transported to where it was needed .
those who could afford to , came to rely on expensive imports from the rest of the world , rather than food grown within angola .
computer terra verde is a joint angolan-israeli business , but the agricultural expertise comes from europe and israel .
the company has built its own pumping station 6km away on the banks of the river bengo to ensure that its drip-irrigation system , where plants are fed water and fertilizer drip by drip through ground level pipes , would never run dry .
because of the war there are untold numbers of mines out there and goods and people ca n't move freely rick corsino wfp country director a computer programme calculates the exact amounts of water needed , depending on temperature and humidity .
different varieties of vegetables are grown both in open fields and greenhouses depending on their suitability to angola 's almost tropical climate .
and the company buys in boxes of bees to pollinate its tomato plants organically .
all this investment came with a price tag of some $ 8m .
the company says the farm is paying its way but will not say how much profit they make or what their turnover is like .
" this is a long-term project , " says marketing manager merav zacharin .
" terra verde is very much our calling card .
we want investors to see what we have done here and realise that we could build the same thing for them somewhere else in angola . "
government help some 200 jobs have already been created and the company is expanding .
another farms has been set up in kwanza sul province , which is 10 times bigger than terra verde at 450 hectares .
" angola is hungry for food now , " says mr ben basat .
most of the produce is destined for upmarket supermarkets " they have an impressive history of agricultural production , lots of good land and water . "
but 27 years of civil war have taken their toll .
" the biggest problem this country has is access to food , " according to wfp country director rick corsino .
" there are certain parts of the country in which most of the food is grown .
because of the war there are untold numbers of mines out there and goods and people ca n't move freely . "
this is why those residents of luanda who can afford to , still rely heavily on expensive imported food and terra verde sees imported vegetables as its main competitor .
a kilo of tomatoes costs about $ 4 in the supermarket , compared to $ 6 for imported produce .
this is not cheap food and the average angolan ca n't afford the produce grown at terra verde .
their market includes large supermarkets , restaurants and the country 's big employers - the oil and diamond companies .
mr ben basat thinks there 's only one way to lower prices considerably in angola .
" in most countries the government assists the agricultural sector .
but here they have n't helped us at all , " he says .
" it 's very expensive to produce here and so the prices are very high .
if they want the prices to go down so that everybody from angola can buy our product , then it needs the power of the government .
i do n't see any other way . "

the us senate will vote this month on a bill to impose tariffs of up to 27.5 % on some chinese goods unless beijing moves to free up its currency .
some us politicians believe the yuan is artificially undervalued , letting china sell its products more cheaply abroad .
china has ruled out another revaluation after raising the yuan 's value in july .
' limited progress ' chinese prime minister wen jiabao said recently that beijing would allow greater flexibility in its exchange rate .
however , the bush administration is pressing for more substantial action , believing the yuan 's value is fuelling the growing us trade deficit .
ahead of a series of meetings with senior chinese officials , senator charles schumer said the purpose of the trip was not to deliver ultimatums but to learn about chinese intentions on the issue .
" to say that there has been no progress would be wrong but to say that there has been complete progress would be wrong , " he said .
" we would like to get an idea from our chinese hosts what the future is going to be like . "
