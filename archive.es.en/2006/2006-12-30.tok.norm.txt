the execution of saddam hussein in the early hours of the muslim sacrificial festival id el adha must have come as a release for former victims of his nearly 30-year reign of terror who did n't find peace even after the ousting of saddam .
the hanging will also likely end any remaining illusions and hopes that saddam 's supporters may have had that history could be rewritten and that lost power could be restored . it seems that the swift execution of saddam 's death sentence was meant primarily to serve these two groups .
the new iraqi leadership considers it appropriate to draw a line under the saddam era as quickly as possible .
so much so that the execution appeared over-hasty und did n't necessarily correspond with legal fundaments .
rather , the speedy hanging appeared to have been carried out to demonstrate the iraqi government 's own power which was called into question by the americans themselves in recent weeks . maliki 's government will have to live with this burden of doubt .
whether it damages the government will very much depend on how the country reacts to the execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we certainly ca n't expect an immediate calm in the country and it remains to be seen whether that will happen in the long term .
but there 's enough reason to believe it wo n't happen .
the differences between the various groups who bomb themselves through daily life in iraq are too huge and saddam had already become too marginal for his death to suddenly change things . a missed historic chance but the quick elimination of saddam means iraq has missed a historic chance to thoroughly deal with and come to grips with his reign of terror . despite all the problems , the legal process was the right way : saddam hussein was to be held guilty for the crimes of his regime .
he was convicted for the murder of 148 shiites , but what about the 100,000 dead and those persecuted in the anfal campaign ?
what about the murdered kurds of halabja , the murdered shiites of the kuwait war ?
what about the hundreds of thousands of victims of the wars that saddam started , particularly against iran but also against kuwait ? without the main suspect , these questions will likely remain unanswered .
saddam 's end is not necessarily a hopeful new beginning for iraq .

" we respect the verdict , but the german government is known to be opposed in principle to the death penalty , " merkel said in berlin on saturday after iraqi officials executed saddam in baghdad by hanging earlier that day . the chancellor added that her thoughts were with the many innocent victims of saddam 's regime . " i hope the iraqi people will be able to go their own way in peace and without violence , " she said . saddam had been sentenced to death for ordering the murder of 148 men and boys in the shiite village of dujail in 1982 . opposition politicians also criticized the execution .
free democrats foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gerhard meanwhile called the hanging of saddam " unacceptable , " and said a life sentence would have set a milestone . left party spokesman gregor gysi said the execution " did not mark the start of greater democracy in iraq . " greens spokesman fritz kuhn said iraqis needed to draw a line under the " chain of death and revenge . " saturday 's execution hides the danger that supporters of saddam hussein will in future regard the ex-dictator as a martyr , " kuhn said . europe condemns death penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein remained defiant during his trial in past months others in europe also commented on the execution . " the eu condemns the crimes committed by saddam and also the death penalty , " cristina gallach , a spokeswoman for javier solana , the eu high representative for foreign affairs , told news agency afp . france , a staunch opponent of the death penalty as well as the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , called on iraqis to work towards reconciliation and national unity after the execution . " france calls upon all iraqis to look towards the future and work towards reconciliation and national unity , " the french foreign ministry said in a statement .
" now more than ever , the objective should be a return to full sovereignty and stability in iraq .
vatican : " tragic news " the vatican called the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein tragic , saying it could feed a spirit of vengeance .
" there is a risk that it feeds the spirit of vengeance and plants the seeds for fresh violence , " vatican spokesman frederico lombardi said . the hanging of saddam hussein , early on saturday , was " tragic news " , he said on vatican radio .
" this is a reason for sadness , even if this is about a person who is guilty of serious crimes .
the position of the catholic church , which is against the death penalty whatever the circumstances , needs to be repeated again , " he said .
" putting a guilty person to death is not the way to rebuild justice and reconcile society , " lombardi added . britain : saddam ' held to account ' britain on saturday said saddam hussein had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the use of the death penalty .
" i welcome the fact that saddam hussein has been tried by an iraqi court for at least some of the appalling crimes he committed against the iraqi people , " said foreign secretary margaret beckett . " he has now been held to account . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain still has over 7,000 soldiers in iraq britain was the us ' main ally during the 2003 invasion of iraq and still has some 7,200 troops in the country .
saddam 's execution has put blair 's government in a difficult position however because of its opposition to the death penalty .
" the british government does not support the use of the death penalty , in iraq or anywhere else , " beckett said .
" we advocate an end to the death penalty worldwide , regardless of the individual or the crime .
" we have made our position very clear to the iraqi authorities , but we respect their decision as that of a sovereign nation , " she added . " iraq continues to face huge challenges .
but now it has a democratically-elected government which represents all communities and is committed to fostering reconciliation . " bush : " an important milestone " us president george w. bush meanwhile hailed saddam hussein 's execution as " an important milestone " on the road to building an iraqi democracy but warned it would not end deadly violence there .
" saddam hussein 's execution comes at the end of a difficult year for the iraqi people and for our troops , " bush said in a statement released as he prepared to usher in 2007 at his texas ranch . human rights group condemns hanging however us-based rights group human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- condemned the hanging , saying history would judge saddam 's trial and execution " harshly . " " saddam hussein was responsible for horrific , widespread human rights violations , but those acts , however brutal , can not justify his execution , a cruel and inhuman punishment , " said hrw 's international justice program director , richard dicker .
" the test of a government 's commitment to human rights is measured by the way it treats its worst offenders , " he said .

" the new year often makes us believe we can put the troubling aspects of our lives behind us and begin anew . " resolution tips the internet is full of sites that offer advice on keeping those resolutions .
most of them tell people to keep their feet firmly on the ground when making the goals .
winning the lottery , says ehow.com , is " out of your grasp . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many resolve at new year 's to lose weight instead of shooting for the near unattainable or resolving to change a major behavior pattern overnight , come up with a strategy that stays specific .

if smoking helped you to relax in the past , and you want to quit smoking , find another way to relax and practice that regularly . unrealistic expectations but making resolutions is a tricky business .

" malignant narcissism " under his leadership from 1979 to 2003 , the baath regime ordered army deserters ' ears cut off , sentenced foreign currency traffickers to death and reportedly beheaded dozens of women for prostitution . a former cia psychologist once described saddam as suffering from " malignant narcissism , " exhibiting an extreme lack of empathy and a will to use violence , which he attributed to a troubled upbringing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein unleashed a reign of terror born poor in a mud-hut village near tikrit on april 28 , 1937 , saddam was orphaned at a young age and raised by an uncle who idolised adolf hitler .
he overcame his impoverished roots and rose to iraq 's highest office , lived in the grandest of palaces , married three times and fathered six children . in arabic , his name means " the stubborn one " or " he who strikes . "
his self-importance and cult of personality were legendary .
on his 60th birthday he commissioned a copy of the koran to be inscribed in his own blood . saddam also groomed two of his sons , uday and qusay , in his own image .
they became feared for their use of torture and rape .
the two were killed during a fire fight with us forces in the northern city of mosul in july 2003 , five months before their father was captured in a farmyard hole in the ground . ruling with an iron fist saddam , who worked in the baath party security apparatus , first made a name for himself by trying to murder iraqi leader abdul karim kassem in 1959 . wounded in the leg , the future dictator fled abroad but returned four years later and was jailed in 1964 .
within two years he had escaped and resumed clandestine work for the baath party .
in 1968 he took part in the coup that brought the party to power , marking another step in his affair with brute force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discovery of a mass grave in mahaweel , south of baghdad , in 2003 as party deputy secretary general and vice president of the all-powerful revolution command council -lrb- rcc -rrb- , he was already considered the real power behind president ahmed hassan al-bakr .
bakr lost his grip over the next decade as saddam strengthened his own , and the president finally retired for health reasons . saddam seized the mantle on july 16 , 1979 , becoming state president , general secretary of the party and president of the rcc .
in the years that followed , the modern arab state labelled the cradle of civilisation became an impoverished pariah , its fabulous oil wealth squandered . saddam guided iraq through a 1980-1988 bloodbath with iran and the rout of the 1991 gulf war over kuwait , emerging each time to claim pyrrhic victories over the corpses of his people .
he defied attempts through the united nations to ensure his disarmament - the organisation 's crushing sanctions and four nights of us and british missile strikes in december 1998 . saddam extended frequent purges of senior figures to family and friends .
those who failed to make it into exile were detained , murdered and buried in the mass graves that have been uncovered across the country . a humiliating end since his sensational capture by american troops in a hole in a ground in iraq in december 2003 , images of saddam as a gaunt and greying prisoner have been splashed across the world - with some controversial photographs even showing him just in his underwear . the 69-year-old arab nationalist , who once declared his determination to die at home and taunted enemies with outrageous bravado , was toppled days after the us-led invasion began in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous toppling of the saddam statue in 2003 his massive statue in central baghdad was pulled down on april 9 , and nine months later saddam was discovered , long-haired , bearded and bedraggled , in an underground crawlspace near tikrit . his ability to evade capture for so long was evidence of the profound influence he exerted over his people even after his ouster , as many ordinary iraqis shrank from cooperating with the occupier for fear of saddam 's return . but others saw him as a strong leader who rained inaccurate but psychologically damaging scud rockets on israel and at least briefly restored self-respect to the arab nation . nevertheless , saddam 's reign ended in defeat , his ubiquitous portraits torn down and destroyed after the occupation of his capital .
a lust for power matched by a ruthless streak had brought saddam to the helm he determined never to leave , whatever the cost . us soldiers who guarded him in prison told a us magazine last year that saddam was an " oddly endearing crazy man " who still called himself the president and remained convinced the people still loved him . less than two years earlier , however , iraqis called for his death when us civilian administrator paul bremer announced saddam 's capture to the world using the dramatic words " ladies and gentlemen , we got him . " on november 5 , saddam finally learned what he must have known would be his inevitable fate : death by hanging , the fate of a common criminal , rather than his stated preference for the firing squad , which is reserved for soldiers . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

" we respect the verdict , but the german government is known to be opposed in principle to the death penalty , " merkel said in berlin on saturday after iraqi officials executed saddam in baghdad by hanging earlier that day . the chancellor added that her thoughts were with the many innocent victims of saddam 's regime . " i hope the iraqi people will be able to go their own way in peace and without violence , " she said . saddam had been sentenced to death for ordering the murder of 148 men and boys in the shiite village of dujail in 1982 . opposition politicians also criticized the execution .
free democrats foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gerhard meanwhile called the hanging of saddam " unacceptable , " and said a life sentence would have set a milestone . left party spokesman gregor gysi said the execution " did not mark the start of greater democracy in iraq . " greens spokesman fritz kuhn said iraqis needed to draw a line under the " chain of death and revenge . " saturday 's execution hides the danger that supporters of saddam hussein will in future regard the ex-dictator as a martyr , " kuhn said . europe condemns death penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein remained defiant during his trial in past months others in europe also commented on the execution . " the eu condemns the crimes committed by saddam and also the death penalty , " cristina gallach , a spokeswoman for javier solana , the eu high representative for foreign affairs , told news agency afp . france , a staunch opponent of the death penalty as well as the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , called on iraqis to work towards reconciliation and national unity after the execution . " france calls upon all iraqis to look towards the future and work towards reconciliation and national unity , " the french foreign ministry said in a statement .
" now more than ever , the objective should be a return to full sovereignty and stability in iraq .
vatican : " tragic news " the vatican called the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein tragic , saying it could feed a spirit of vengeance .
" there is a risk that it feeds the spirit of vengeance and plants the seeds for fresh violence , " vatican spokesman frederico lombardi said . the hanging of saddam hussein , early on saturday , was " tragic news " , he said on vatican radio .
" this is a reason for sadness , even if this is about a person who is guilty of serious crimes .
the position of the catholic church , which is against the death penalty whatever the circumstances , needs to be repeated again , " he said .
" putting a guilty person to death is not the way to rebuild justice and reconcile society , " lombardi added . britain : saddam ' held to account ' britain on saturday said saddam hussein had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the use of the death penalty .
" i welcome the fact that saddam hussein has been tried by an iraqi court for at least some of the appalling crimes he committed against the iraqi people , " said foreign secretary margaret beckett . " he has now been held to account . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain still has over 7,000 soldiers in iraq britain was the us ' main ally during the 2003 invasion of iraq and still has some 7,200 troops in the country .
saddam 's execution has put blair 's government in a difficult position however because of its opposition to the death penalty .
" the british government does not support the use of the death penalty , in iraq or anywhere else , " beckett said .
" we advocate an end to the death penalty worldwide , regardless of the individual or the crime .
" we have made our position very clear to the iraqi authorities , but we respect their decision as that of a sovereign nation , " she added . " iraq continues to face huge challenges .
but now it has a democratically-elected government which represents all communities and is committed to fostering reconciliation . " bush : " an important milestone " us president george w. bush meanwhile hailed saddam hussein 's execution as " an important milestone " on the road to building an iraqi democracy but warned it would not end deadly violence there .
" saddam hussein 's execution comes at the end of a difficult year for the iraqi people and for our troops , " bush said in a statement released as he prepared to usher in 2007 at his texas ranch . human rights group condemns hanging however us-based rights group human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- condemned the hanging , saying history would judge saddam 's trial and execution " harshly . " " saddam hussein was responsible for horrific , widespread human rights violations , but those acts , however brutal , can not justify his execution , a cruel and inhuman punishment , " said hrw 's international justice program director , richard dicker .

" we respect the verdict , but the german government is known to be opposed in principle to the death penalty , " merkel said in berlin on saturday after iraqi officials executed saddam in baghdad by hanging earlier that day . the chancellor added that her thoughts were with the many innocent victims of saddam 's regime . " i hope the iraqi people will be able to go their own way in peace and without violence , " she said . saddam had been sentenced to death for ordering the murder of 148 men and boys in the shiite village of dujail in 1982 . opposition politicians also criticized the execution .
free democrats foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gerhard meanwhile called the hanging of saddam " unacceptable , " and said a life sentence would have set a milestone . left party spokesman gregor gysi said the execution " did not mark the start of greater democracy in iraq . " greens spokesman fritz kuhn said iraqis needed to draw a line under the " chain of death and revenge . " saturday 's execution hides the danger that supporters of saddam hussein will in future regard the ex-dictator as a martyr , " kuhn said . europe condemns death penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein remained defiant during his trial in past months others in europe also commented on the execution . " the eu condemns the crimes committed by saddam and also the death penalty , " cristina gallach , a spokeswoman for javier solana , the eu high representative for foreign affairs , told news agency afp . france , a staunch opponent of the death penalty as well as the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , called on iraqis to work towards reconciliation and national unity after the execution . " france calls upon all iraqis to look towards the future and work towards reconciliation and national unity , " the french foreign ministry said in a statement .
" now more than ever , the objective should be a return to full sovereignty and stability in iraq .
vatican : " tragic news " the vatican called the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein tragic , saying it could feed a spirit of vengeance .
" there is a risk that it feeds the spirit of vengeance and plants the seeds for fresh violence , " vatican spokesman frederico lombardi said . the hanging of saddam hussein , early on saturday , was " tragic news " , he said on vatican radio .
" this is a reason for sadness , even if this is about a person who is guilty of serious crimes .
the position of the catholic church , which is against the death penalty whatever the circumstances , needs to be repeated again , " he said .
" putting a guilty person to death is not the way to rebuild justice and reconcile society , " lombardi added . britain : saddam ' held to account ' britain on saturday said saddam hussein had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the use of the death penalty .
" i welcome the fact that saddam hussein has been tried by an iraqi court for at least some of the appalling crimes he committed against the iraqi people , " said foreign secretary margaret beckett . " he has now been held to account . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain still has over 7,000 soldiers in iraq britain was the us ' main ally during the 2003 invasion of iraq and still has some 7,200 troops in the country .
saddam 's execution has put blair 's government in a difficult position however because of its opposition to the death penalty .
" the british government does not support the use of the death penalty , in iraq or anywhere else , " beckett said .
" we advocate an end to the death penalty worldwide , regardless of the individual or the crime .
" we have made our position very clear to the iraqi authorities , but we respect their decision as that of a sovereign nation , " she added . " iraq continues to face huge challenges .
but now it has a democratically-elected government which represents all communities and is committed to fostering reconciliation . " bush : " an important milestone " us president george w. bush meanwhile hailed saddam hussein 's execution as " an important milestone " on the road to building an iraqi democracy but warned it would not end deadly violence there .
" saddam hussein 's execution comes at the end of a difficult year for the iraqi people and for our troops , " bush said in a statement released as he prepared to usher in 2007 at his texas ranch . human rights group condemns hanging however us-based rights group human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- condemned the hanging , saying history would judge saddam 's trial and execution " harshly . " " saddam hussein was responsible for horrific , widespread human rights violations , but those acts , however brutal , can not justify his execution , a cruel and inhuman punishment , " said hrw 's international justice program director , richard dicker .
" the test of a government 's commitment to human rights is measured by the way it treats its worst offenders , " he said .

" malignant narcissism " under his leadership from 1979 to 2003 , the baath regime ordered army deserters ' ears cut off , sentenced foreign currency traffickers to death and reportedly beheaded dozens of women for prostitution . a former cia psychologist once described saddam as suffering from " malignant narcissism , " exhibiting an extreme lack of empathy and a will to use violence , which he attributed to a troubled upbringing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein unleashed a reign of terror born poor in a mud-hut village near tikrit on april 28 , 1937 , saddam was orphaned at a young age and raised by an uncle who idolised adolf hitler .
he overcame his impoverished roots and rose to iraq 's highest office , lived in the grandest of palaces , married three times and fathered six children . in arabic , his name means " the stubborn one " or " he who strikes . "
his self-importance and cult of personality were legendary .
on his 60th birthday he commissioned a copy of the koran to be inscribed in his own blood . saddam also groomed two of his sons , uday and qusay , in his own image .
they became feared for their use of torture and rape .
the two were killed during a fire fight with us forces in the northern city of mosul in july 2003 , five months before their father was captured in a farmyard hole in the ground . ruling with an iron fist saddam , who worked in the baath party security apparatus , first made a name for himself by trying to murder iraqi leader abdul karim kassem in 1959 . wounded in the leg , the future dictator fled abroad but returned four years later and was jailed in 1964 .
within two years he had escaped and resumed clandestine work for the baath party .
in 1968 he took part in the coup that brought the party to power , marking another step in his affair with brute force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discovery of a mass grave in mahaweel , south of baghdad , in 2003 as party deputy secretary general and vice president of the all-powerful revolution command council -lrb- rcc -rrb- , he was already considered the real power behind president ahmed hassan al-bakr .
bakr lost his grip over the next decade as saddam strengthened his own , and the president finally retired for health reasons . saddam seized the mantle on july 16 , 1979 , becoming state president , general secretary of the party and president of the rcc .
in the years that followed , the modern arab state labelled the cradle of civilisation became an impoverished pariah , its fabulous oil wealth squandered . saddam guided iraq through a 1980-1988 bloodbath with iran and the rout of the 1991 gulf war over kuwait , emerging each time to claim pyrrhic victories over the corpses of his people .
he defied attempts through the united nations to ensure his disarmament - the organisation 's crushing sanctions and four nights of us and british missile strikes in december 1998 . saddam extended frequent purges of senior figures to family and friends .
those who failed to make it into exile were detained , murdered and buried in the mass graves that have been uncovered across the country . a humiliating end since his sensational capture by american troops in a hole in a ground in iraq in december 2003 , images of saddam as a gaunt and greying prisoner have been splashed across the world - with some controversial photographs even showing him just in his underwear . the 69-year-old arab nationalist , who once declared his determination to die at home and taunted enemies with outrageous bravado , was toppled days after the us-led invasion began in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous toppling of the saddam statue in 2003 his massive statue in central baghdad was pulled down on april 9 , and nine months later saddam was discovered , long-haired , bearded and bedraggled , in an underground crawlspace near tikrit . his ability to evade capture for so long was evidence of the profound influence he exerted over his people even after his ouster , as many ordinary iraqis shrank from cooperating with the occupier for fear of saddam 's return . but others saw him as a strong leader who rained inaccurate but psychologically damaging scud rockets on israel and at least briefly restored self-respect to the arab nation . nevertheless , saddam 's reign ended in defeat , his ubiquitous portraits torn down and destroyed after the occupation of his capital .
a lust for power matched by a ruthless streak had brought saddam to the helm he determined never to leave , whatever the cost . us soldiers who guarded him in prison told a us magazine last year that saddam was an " oddly endearing crazy man " who still called himself the president and remained convinced the people still loved him . less than two years earlier , however , iraqis called for his death when us civilian administrator paul bremer announced saddam 's capture to the world using the dramatic words " ladies and gentlemen , we got him . " on november 5 , saddam finally learned what he must have known would be his inevitable fate : death by hanging , the fate of a common criminal , rather than his stated preference for the firing squad , which is reserved for soldiers . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

there needs to be intervention .
this will only get worse . - kathy wittig , us perhaps the early execution of hussein will send a signal to other potential aggressors that they may be punished after fair trial .

" malignant narcissism " under his leadership from 1979 to 2003 , the baath regime ordered army deserters ' ears cut off , sentenced foreign currency traffickers to death and reportedly beheaded dozens of women for prostitution . a former cia psychologist once described saddam as suffering from " malignant narcissism , " exhibiting an extreme lack of empathy and a will to use violence , which he attributed to a troubled upbringing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein unleashed a reign of terror born poor in a mud-hut village near tikrit on april 28 , 1937 , saddam was orphaned at a young age and raised by an uncle who idolised adolf hitler .
he overcame his impoverished roots and rose to iraq 's highest office , lived in the grandest of palaces , married three times and fathered six children . in arabic , his name means " the stubborn one " or " he who strikes . "
his self-importance and cult of personality were legendary .
on his 60th birthday he commissioned a copy of the koran to be inscribed in his own blood . saddam also groomed two of his sons , uday and qusay , in his own image .
they became feared for their use of torture and rape .
the two were killed during a fire fight with us forces in the northern city of mosul in july 2003 , five months before their father was captured in a farmyard hole in the ground . ruling with an iron fist saddam , who worked in the baath party security apparatus , first made a name for himself by trying to murder iraqi leader abdul karim kassem in 1959 . wounded in the leg , the future dictator fled abroad but returned four years later and was jailed in 1964 .
within two years he had escaped and resumed clandestine work for the baath party .
in 1968 he took part in the coup that brought the party to power , marking another step in his affair with brute force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discovery of a mass grave in mahaweel , south of baghdad , in 2003 as party deputy secretary general and vice president of the all-powerful revolution command council -lrb- rcc -rrb- , he was already considered the real power behind president ahmed hassan al-bakr .
bakr lost his grip over the next decade as saddam strengthened his own , and the president finally retired for health reasons . saddam seized the mantle on july 16 , 1979 , becoming state president , general secretary of the party and president of the rcc .
in the years that followed , the modern arab state labelled the cradle of civilisation became an impoverished pariah , its fabulous oil wealth squandered . saddam guided iraq through a 1980-1988 bloodbath with iran and the rout of the 1991 gulf war over kuwait , emerging each time to claim pyrrhic victories over the corpses of his people .
he defied attempts through the united nations to ensure his disarmament - the organisation 's crushing sanctions and four nights of us and british missile strikes in december 1998 . saddam extended frequent purges of senior figures to family and friends .
those who failed to make it into exile were detained , murdered and buried in the mass graves that have been uncovered across the country . a humiliating end since his sensational capture by american troops in a hole in a ground in iraq in december 2003 , images of saddam as a gaunt and greying prisoner have been splashed across the world - with some controversial photographs even showing him just in his underwear . the 69-year-old arab nationalist , who once declared his determination to die at home and taunted enemies with outrageous bravado , was toppled days after the us-led invasion began in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous toppling of the saddam statue in 2003 his massive statue in central baghdad was pulled down on april 9 , and nine months later saddam was discovered , long-haired , bearded and bedraggled , in an underground crawlspace near tikrit . his ability to evade capture for so long was evidence of the profound influence he exerted over his people even after his ouster , as many ordinary iraqis shrank from cooperating with the occupier for fear of saddam 's return . but others saw him as a strong leader who rained inaccurate but psychologically damaging scud rockets on israel and at least briefly restored self-respect to the arab nation . nevertheless , saddam 's reign ended in defeat , his ubiquitous portraits torn down and destroyed after the occupation of his capital .
a lust for power matched by a ruthless streak had brought saddam to the helm he determined never to leave , whatever the cost . us soldiers who guarded him in prison told a us magazine last year that saddam was an " oddly endearing crazy man " who still called himself the president and remained convinced the people still loved him . less than two years earlier , however , iraqis called for his death when us civilian administrator paul bremer announced saddam 's capture to the world using the dramatic words " ladies and gentlemen , we got him . " on november 5 , saddam finally learned what he must have known would be his inevitable fate : death by hanging , the fate of a common criminal , rather than his stated preference for the firing squad , which is reserved for soldiers . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

" malignant narcissism " under his leadership from 1979 to 2003 , the baath regime ordered army deserters ' ears cut off , sentenced foreign currency traffickers to death and reportedly beheaded dozens of women for prostitution . a former cia psychologist once described saddam as suffering from " malignant narcissism , " exhibiting an extreme lack of empathy and a will to use violence , which he attributed to a troubled upbringing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein unleashed a reign of terror born poor in a mud-hut village near tikrit on april 28 , 1937 , saddam was orphaned at a young age and raised by an uncle who idolised adolf hitler .
he overcame his impoverished roots and rose to iraq 's highest office , lived in the grandest of palaces , married three times and fathered six children . in arabic , his name means " the stubborn one " or " he who strikes . "
his self-importance and cult of personality were legendary .
on his 60th birthday he commissioned a copy of the koran to be inscribed in his own blood . saddam also groomed two of his sons , uday and qusay , in his own image .
they became feared for their use of torture and rape .
the two were killed during a fire fight with us forces in the northern city of mosul in july 2003 , five months before their father was captured in a farmyard hole in the ground . ruling with an iron fist saddam , who worked in the baath party security apparatus , first made a name for himself by trying to murder iraqi leader abdul karim kassem in 1959 . wounded in the leg , the future dictator fled abroad but returned four years later and was jailed in 1964 .
within two years he had escaped and resumed clandestine work for the baath party .
in 1968 he took part in the coup that brought the party to power , marking another step in his affair with brute force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discovery of a mass grave in mahaweel , south of baghdad , in 2003 as party deputy secretary general and vice president of the all-powerful revolution command council -lrb- rcc -rrb- , he was already considered the real power behind president ahmed hassan al-bakr .
bakr lost his grip over the next decade as saddam strengthened his own , and the president finally retired for health reasons . saddam seized the mantle on july 16 , 1979 , becoming state president , general secretary of the party and president of the rcc .
in the years that followed , the modern arab state labelled the cradle of civilisation became an impoverished pariah , its fabulous oil wealth squandered . saddam guided iraq through a 1980-1988 bloodbath with iran and the rout of the 1991 gulf war over kuwait , emerging each time to claim pyrrhic victories over the corpses of his people .

champagne bottles pop and couples kiss when the clock strikes midnight .
the dawn of a new year offers people the promise of positive change . we all do it .
when a new year draws near , we vow we 're going to lose weight , stop smoking , drink less , exercise more , be nicer to other people , look for a new job , do good deeds , call our mothers more often , say " i love you " to those who matter . robert tyminski , a san francisco-based psychologist , said all those new year 's resolutions have to do with seasonal changes and their effects on our psyches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new year 's fireworks " we 've entered a period characterized by less daylight and more darkness , and this change serves to remind us that life is a cycle with beginnings and endings , " he said . " the new year often makes us believe we can put the troubling aspects of our lives behind us and begin anew . " resolution tips the internet is full of sites that offer advice on keeping those resolutions .
most of them tell people to keep their feet firmly on the ground when making the goals .
winning the lottery , says ehow.com , is " out of your grasp . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many resolve at new year 's to lose weight instead of shooting for the near unattainable or resolving to change a major behavior pattern overnight , come up with a strategy that stays specific .
instead of resolving to " not be lazy , " something like " i want to exercise more " has a better chance of success . even better : name three days a week on which you will exercise for one hour , the site recommends . another positive " ehow " tip : " find alternatives to a behavior you want to change and make it part of your resolution plan . "
if smoking helped you to relax in the past , and you want to quit smoking , find another way to relax and practice that regularly . unrealistic expectations but making resolutions is a tricky business .
for all the promise of a new beginning with the new year , many psychologists say that setting goals too high is the surest way to fall short . " when resolutions are out of proportion to what is realistic for our circumstances , they can set someone up for a fall , " said tyminski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resolutions are personal goals to keep us on track - or intact he generally gets a flood of calls around late january and early february from people seeking help because they have been let down by resolutions made but not kept . the blues can even set in on new year 's eve since it 's a time people tend to take stock of the year just passed - at least before the champagne really starts to flow .
many people looking back realize that despite the best intentions , those resolutions fell by the wayside . " empirical studies show that new year 's resolutions generally do not stick , " jörg fengler , a psychology professor at the university of cologne , told the dpa news agency .
" most of time , we shamelessly abandon them after just a few days . " idiosyncrasies cultural differences could play a role as to how people go about resolutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then there 's always the crystal ball and tarot looking at popular new year 's resolutions listed on the us government 's portal firstgov.gov , you can glean how major problems affecting american society - obesity and debt - detemine how some people define good intentions for the new year .
the top resolutions posted : to " lose weight , pay off debt and save money . " tyminski 's own grandparents were immigrants from europe , and often encouraged a focus on improving the family 's material status . " i think prosperity may be a central point of resolutions for those in the us , " he said .
" i remember when i lived in germany that i was struck by how understated the resolutions were there . " pointing the way - with lead while resolution-making in germany might not have the sheer amplitude it does in the us , germans do like to think about the future , and many go about trying to divine it .
they do this by " pouring lead , " or bleigiessen .
it 's somewhat similar to reading tea leaves , or maybe studying animal entrails , like the ancient romans enjoyed , but considerably less messy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pouring lead " is an old custom after a festive dinner , people sit in a circle and alternately melt chunks of lead -lrb- or sometimes wax -rrb- on a spoon as they hold it over a lit candle . the molten lead is then poured from the spoon into a bucket of cold water , where it hardens immediately . the shape of the hardened lead is then interpreted by the group , and is said to reflect what the future has in store for the one who poured the lead .
an egg shape could imply an addition to the family ; a tree could mean growth in one 's capabilities ; an angel could mean goodwill .
with this tradition , if the thing promised does not come true , at least there 's something else to pin the blame on besides your own lack of discipline or personal shortcoming - it 's the lead 's fault . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness is danish life appreciation research seeks to answer one of our most daunting questions : what is the key to happiness ?

dw-world.de readers comment on the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
while some seem to think he got what he deserved , others wrote that his death might provoke further violence . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . violence creates more violence !
as an american , i am deeply troubled by the execution .
i feel we took the place of pontius pilate !
saddam should have been tried by an international court .
handing him over to the shiites caused an unjust trial , a short appeal which became a farce , and an execution , that is an affront to human dignity .
as an iraqi , i would fear those responsible for his death as much as once saddam !
it 's a " milestone " in more misery . - elisabeth heptner , us i do not feel it was a prudent move , but the bush regime does n't think through the big picture .
i see nothing more than blood shed .
a country that is attacked under false pretenses reserves the right to defend itself and suddenly they are terrorists , killed or whisked away to be inhumanely humiliated and tortured .
there needs to be intervention .
this will only get worse . - kathy wittig , us perhaps the early execution of hussein will send a signal to other potential aggressors that they may be punished after fair trial .
even the dictator could at last lament on his fate today , that if he had not pushed iraq into the wars , he would not now be walking the last steps as a disowned former tyrant . - p aul lang as a german citizen who lives in the us , i get the feeling that perhaps i 've become a bit to americanized -lrb- maybe it 's the constant violent crime here -rrb- .i think there are people on this earth who deserve to die , and hussein was certainly one .
maybe a more just punishment would be to let him loose into a crowd of all the victims , and the relatives of victims that he brutalized over the years .
justice in the basest sense of the word .
i hope it brings some type of closure to all those he tortured , raped , degraded , orphaned and murdered . - eva-maria barry saddam hussein 's trial and execution were both gross travesties of justice .
those countries that either actively or passively supported the act of capital punishment upon saddam hussein could be seen as colluding in murder .
not a positive outcome ! - m aureen t. couch that was the wrong thing , at the wrong time , in the wrong place .
i think the price will be high for the american project in the middle east and much higher for the government in iraq . - a iman yunes there are many compelling reasons to oppose the death penalty .
and there is plenty of hypocrisy to go around .
but does that nullify justice ?
will the death of saddam bring about reconciliation ?
of course not !
reconciliation is the goal of the living .
saddam has taken this option away from hundreds of his own citizens !
the perpetrator of genocide -lrb- the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national , racial , political , or cultural group -rrb- should not be treated with pity .
saddam 's trial , in accordance with the law , treated him fairly .
saddam has sentenced many to death .
now he has gotten the sentence he deserves . - e ric letourneau saddam got what he deserved .
god bless the usa - mb harvey when will the violence stop ?
executing saddam hussein solves nothing but will only create more violence . - bruce hoyer i believe that taking his life for the lives of the 148 shiite muslims in 1982 is a scam .
it is the us government 's attempt to distract the world in its shameful and distasteful attempt at controlling and occupying the second largest oil producing nation in the world .
kim jong ii , admits he has nuclear capabilities , but there 's no mention of an invasion of north korea , and he is far worse than saddam hussein .
my question is : why ca n't anyone find the admitted killer , osama bin laden ? - rich , us are we really growing spiritually by cheering somebody 's death , like some viewers in a football field ?
or are we going back in our human nature showing a total lack of a affection for the life itself , many lives were lost along the world history for sure .
but will this single event demonstrate who we really are ?
well , only god knows it . - cezar compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel on hussein execution : " we respect the verdict " saying that iraqis have missed a chance to deal with its past and might now face further violence , german and other european leaders on saturday criticized the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .

the execution of saddam hussein in the early hours of the muslim sacrificial festival id el adha must have come as a release for former victims of his nearly 30-year reign of terror who did n't find peace even after the ousting of saddam .
the hanging will also likely end any remaining illusions and hopes that saddam 's supporters may have had that history could be rewritten and that lost power could be restored . it seems that the swift execution of saddam 's death sentence was meant primarily to serve these two groups .
the new iraqi leadership considers it appropriate to draw a line under the saddam era as quickly as possible .
so much so that the execution appeared over-hasty und did n't necessarily correspond with legal fundaments .
rather , the speedy hanging appeared to have been carried out to demonstrate the iraqi government 's own power which was called into question by the americans themselves in recent weeks . maliki 's government will have to live with this burden of doubt .
whether it damages the government will very much depend on how the country reacts to the execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we certainly ca n't expect an immediate calm in the country and it remains to be seen whether that will happen in the long term .
but there 's enough reason to believe it wo n't happen .
the differences between the various groups who bomb themselves through daily life in iraq are too huge and saddam had already become too marginal for his death to suddenly change things . a missed historic chance but the quick elimination of saddam means iraq has missed a historic chance to thoroughly deal with and come to grips with his reign of terror . despite all the problems , the legal process was the right way : saddam hussein was to be held guilty for the crimes of his regime .
he was convicted for the murder of 148 shiites , but what about the 100,000 dead and those persecuted in the anfal campaign ?
what about the murdered kurds of halabja , the murdered shiites of the kuwait war ?
what about the hundreds of thousands of victims of the wars that saddam started , particularly against iran but also against kuwait ? without the main suspect , these questions will likely remain unanswered .
saddam 's end is not necessarily a hopeful new beginning for iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de breaking news -pipe- 30.12.2006 saddam hussein : rise and fall of a brutal dictator großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hated , feared and demonized - saddam hussein 's legacy is a brutal one ousted dictator saddam hussein , who was hanged on saturday , brutally crushed any internal challenge to his despotic rule in iraq for 24 years . the middle east 's most notorious strongman of the late 20th century went to the gallows on saturday after losing his appeal against the death sentence handed down by the iraqi high tribunal over his role in the execution of 148 shiite villagers in 1982 . the massacre in the village of dujail followed an attack on his convoy there in 1982 . in the aftermath , 148 inhabitants of the town north of baghdad died in reprisals by saddam 's security services , who also destroyed homes and crops and sentenced survivors to four years of internal exile . saddam 's ruthlessness and cruelty have been well documented by human rights groups , but his death order inspired conflicting emotions at home as the shiite majority celebrated with rowdy parties and the sunni minority protested . " malignant narcissism " under his leadership from 1979 to 2003 , the baath regime ordered army deserters ' ears cut off , sentenced foreign currency traffickers to death and reportedly beheaded dozens of women for prostitution . a former cia psychologist once described saddam as suffering from " malignant narcissism , " exhibiting an extreme lack of empathy and a will to use violence , which he attributed to a troubled upbringing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein unleashed a reign of terror born poor in a mud-hut village near tikrit on april 28 , 1937 , saddam was orphaned at a young age and raised by an uncle who idolised adolf hitler .
he overcame his impoverished roots and rose to iraq 's highest office , lived in the grandest of palaces , married three times and fathered six children . in arabic , his name means " the stubborn one " or " he who strikes . "
his self-importance and cult of personality were legendary .
on his 60th birthday he commissioned a copy of the koran to be inscribed in his own blood . saddam also groomed two of his sons , uday and qusay , in his own image .
they became feared for their use of torture and rape .
the two were killed during a fire fight with us forces in the northern city of mosul in july 2003 , five months before their father was captured in a farmyard hole in the ground . ruling with an iron fist saddam , who worked in the baath party security apparatus , first made a name for himself by trying to murder iraqi leader abdul karim kassem in 1959 . wounded in the leg , the future dictator fled abroad but returned four years later and was jailed in 1964 .
within two years he had escaped and resumed clandestine work for the baath party .
in 1968 he took part in the coup that brought the party to power , marking another step in his affair with brute force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discovery of a mass grave in mahaweel , south of baghdad , in 2003 as party deputy secretary general and vice president of the all-powerful revolution command council -lrb- rcc -rrb- , he was already considered the real power behind president ahmed hassan al-bakr .
bakr lost his grip over the next decade as saddam strengthened his own , and the president finally retired for health reasons . saddam seized the mantle on july 16 , 1979 , becoming state president , general secretary of the party and president of the rcc .
in the years that followed , the modern arab state labelled the cradle of civilisation became an impoverished pariah , its fabulous oil wealth squandered . saddam guided iraq through a 1980-1988 bloodbath with iran and the rout of the 1991 gulf war over kuwait , emerging each time to claim pyrrhic victories over the corpses of his people .
he defied attempts through the united nations to ensure his disarmament - the organisation 's crushing sanctions and four nights of us and british missile strikes in december 1998 . saddam extended frequent purges of senior figures to family and friends .
those who failed to make it into exile were detained , murdered and buried in the mass graves that have been uncovered across the country . a humiliating end since his sensational capture by american troops in a hole in a ground in iraq in december 2003 , images of saddam as a gaunt and greying prisoner have been splashed across the world - with some controversial photographs even showing him just in his underwear . the 69-year-old arab nationalist , who once declared his determination to die at home and taunted enemies with outrageous bravado , was toppled days after the us-led invasion began in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous toppling of the saddam statue in 2003 his massive statue in central baghdad was pulled down on april 9 , and nine months later saddam was discovered , long-haired , bearded and bedraggled , in an underground crawlspace near tikrit . his ability to evade capture for so long was evidence of the profound influence he exerted over his people even after his ouster , as many ordinary iraqis shrank from cooperating with the occupier for fear of saddam 's return . but others saw him as a strong leader who rained inaccurate but psychologically damaging scud rockets on israel and at least briefly restored self-respect to the arab nation . nevertheless , saddam 's reign ended in defeat , his ubiquitous portraits torn down and destroyed after the occupation of his capital .
a lust for power matched by a ruthless streak had brought saddam to the helm he determined never to leave , whatever the cost . us soldiers who guarded him in prison told a us magazine last year that saddam was an " oddly endearing crazy man " who still called himself the president and remained convinced the people still loved him . less than two years earlier , however , iraqis called for his death when us civilian administrator paul bremer announced saddam 's capture to the world using the dramatic words " ladies and gentlemen , we got him . " on november 5 , saddam finally learned what he must have known would be his inevitable fate : death by hanging , the fate of a common criminal , rather than his stated preference for the firing squad , which is reserved for soldiers . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de psychology -pipe- 30.12.2006 new year 's resolutions remain tricky business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new year 's resolutions do n't survive the first glass of champagne many people ring in the new year with fireworks and friends .
champagne bottles pop and couples kiss when the clock strikes midnight .
the dawn of a new year offers people the promise of positive change . we all do it .
when a new year draws near , we vow we 're going to lose weight , stop smoking , drink less , exercise more , be nicer to other people , look for a new job , do good deeds , call our mothers more often , say " i love you " to those who matter . robert tyminski , a san francisco-based psychologist , said all those new year 's resolutions have to do with seasonal changes and their effects on our psyches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new year 's fireworks " we 've entered a period characterized by less daylight and more darkness , and this change serves to remind us that life is a cycle with beginnings and endings , " he said . " the new year often makes us believe we can put the troubling aspects of our lives behind us and begin anew . " resolution tips the internet is full of sites that offer advice on keeping those resolutions .
most of them tell people to keep their feet firmly on the ground when making the goals .
winning the lottery , says ehow.com , is " out of your grasp . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many resolve at new year 's to lose weight instead of shooting for the near unattainable or resolving to change a major behavior pattern overnight , come up with a strategy that stays specific .
instead of resolving to " not be lazy , " something like " i want to exercise more " has a better chance of success . even better : name three days a week on which you will exercise for one hour , the site recommends . another positive " ehow " tip : " find alternatives to a behavior you want to change and make it part of your resolution plan . "
if smoking helped you to relax in the past , and you want to quit smoking , find another way to relax and practice that regularly . unrealistic expectations but making resolutions is a tricky business .
for all the promise of a new beginning with the new year , many psychologists say that setting goals too high is the surest way to fall short . " when resolutions are out of proportion to what is realistic for our circumstances , they can set someone up for a fall , " said tyminski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resolutions are personal goals to keep us on track - or intact he generally gets a flood of calls around late january and early february from people seeking help because they have been let down by resolutions made but not kept . the blues can even set in on new year 's eve since it 's a time people tend to take stock of the year just passed - at least before the champagne really starts to flow .
many people looking back realize that despite the best intentions , those resolutions fell by the wayside . " empirical studies show that new year 's resolutions generally do not stick , " jörg fengler , a psychology professor at the university of cologne , told the dpa news agency .
" most of time , we shamelessly abandon them after just a few days . " idiosyncrasies cultural differences could play a role as to how people go about resolutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then there 's always the crystal ball and tarot looking at popular new year 's resolutions listed on the us government 's portal firstgov.gov , you can glean how major problems affecting american society - obesity and debt - detemine how some people define good intentions for the new year .
the top resolutions posted : to " lose weight , pay off debt and save money . " tyminski 's own grandparents were immigrants from europe , and often encouraged a focus on improving the family 's material status . " i think prosperity may be a central point of resolutions for those in the us , " he said .
" i remember when i lived in germany that i was struck by how understated the resolutions were there . " pointing the way - with lead while resolution-making in germany might not have the sheer amplitude it does in the us , germans do like to think about the future , and many go about trying to divine it .
they do this by " pouring lead , " or bleigiessen .
it 's somewhat similar to reading tea leaves , or maybe studying animal entrails , like the ancient romans enjoyed , but considerably less messy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pouring lead " is an old custom after a festive dinner , people sit in a circle and alternately melt chunks of lead -lrb- or sometimes wax -rrb- on a spoon as they hold it over a lit candle . the molten lead is then poured from the spoon into a bucket of cold water , where it hardens immediately . the shape of the hardened lead is then interpreted by the group , and is said to reflect what the future has in store for the one who poured the lead .
an egg shape could imply an addition to the family ; a tree could mean growth in one 's capabilities ; an angel could mean goodwill .
with this tradition , if the thing promised does not come true , at least there 's something else to pin the blame on besides your own lack of discipline or personal shortcoming - it 's the lead 's fault . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness is danish life appreciation research seeks to answer one of our most daunting questions : what is the key to happiness ?

" malignant narcissism " under his leadership from 1979 to 2003 , the baath regime ordered army deserters ' ears cut off , sentenced foreign currency traffickers to death and reportedly beheaded dozens of women for prostitution . a former cia psychologist once described saddam as suffering from " malignant narcissism , " exhibiting an extreme lack of empathy and a will to use violence , which he attributed to a troubled upbringing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein unleashed a reign of terror born poor in a mud-hut village near tikrit on april 28 , 1937 , saddam was orphaned at a young age and raised by an uncle who idolised adolf hitler .
he overcame his impoverished roots and rose to iraq 's highest office , lived in the grandest of palaces , married three times and fathered six children . in arabic , his name means " the stubborn one " or " he who strikes . "
his self-importance and cult of personality were legendary .
on his 60th birthday he commissioned a copy of the koran to be inscribed in his own blood . saddam also groomed two of his sons , uday and qusay , in his own image .
they became feared for their use of torture and rape .
the two were killed during a fire fight with us forces in the northern city of mosul in july 2003 , five months before their father was captured in a farmyard hole in the ground . ruling with an iron fist saddam , who worked in the baath party security apparatus , first made a name for himself by trying to murder iraqi leader abdul karim kassem in 1959 . wounded in the leg , the future dictator fled abroad but returned four years later and was jailed in 1964 .
within two years he had escaped and resumed clandestine work for the baath party .
in 1968 he took part in the coup that brought the party to power , marking another step in his affair with brute force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discovery of a mass grave in mahaweel , south of baghdad , in 2003 as party deputy secretary general and vice president of the all-powerful revolution command council -lrb- rcc -rrb- , he was already considered the real power behind president ahmed hassan al-bakr .
bakr lost his grip over the next decade as saddam strengthened his own , and the president finally retired for health reasons . saddam seized the mantle on july 16 , 1979 , becoming state president , general secretary of the party and president of the rcc .
in the years that followed , the modern arab state labelled the cradle of civilisation became an impoverished pariah , its fabulous oil wealth squandered . saddam guided iraq through a 1980-1988 bloodbath with iran and the rout of the 1991 gulf war over kuwait , emerging each time to claim pyrrhic victories over the corpses of his people .
he defied attempts through the united nations to ensure his disarmament - the organisation 's crushing sanctions and four nights of us and british missile strikes in december 1998 . saddam extended frequent purges of senior figures to family and friends .
those who failed to make it into exile were detained , murdered and buried in the mass graves that have been uncovered across the country . a humiliating end since his sensational capture by american troops in a hole in a ground in iraq in december 2003 , images of saddam as a gaunt and greying prisoner have been splashed across the world - with some controversial photographs even showing him just in his underwear . the 69-year-old arab nationalist , who once declared his determination to die at home and taunted enemies with outrageous bravado , was toppled days after the us-led invasion began in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous toppling of the saddam statue in 2003 his massive statue in central baghdad was pulled down on april 9 , and nine months later saddam was discovered , long-haired , bearded and bedraggled , in an underground crawlspace near tikrit . his ability to evade capture for so long was evidence of the profound influence he exerted over his people even after his ouster , as many ordinary iraqis shrank from cooperating with the occupier for fear of saddam 's return . but others saw him as a strong leader who rained inaccurate but psychologically damaging scud rockets on israel and at least briefly restored self-respect to the arab nation . nevertheless , saddam 's reign ended in defeat , his ubiquitous portraits torn down and destroyed after the occupation of his capital .
a lust for power matched by a ruthless streak had brought saddam to the helm he determined never to leave , whatever the cost . us soldiers who guarded him in prison told a us magazine last year that saddam was an " oddly endearing crazy man " who still called himself the president and remained convinced the people still loved him . less than two years earlier , however , iraqis called for his death when us civilian administrator paul bremer announced saddam 's capture to the world using the dramatic words " ladies and gentlemen , we got him . " on november 5 , saddam finally learned what he must have known would be his inevitable fate : death by hanging , the fate of a common criminal , rather than his stated preference for the firing squad , which is reserved for soldiers . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" we respect the verdict , but the german government is known to be opposed in principle to the death penalty , " merkel said in berlin on saturday after iraqi officials executed saddam in baghdad by hanging earlier that day . the chancellor added that her thoughts were with the many innocent victims of saddam 's regime . " i hope the iraqi people will be able to go their own way in peace and without violence , " she said . saddam had been sentenced to death for ordering the murder of 148 men and boys in the shiite village of dujail in 1982 . opposition politicians also criticized the execution .
free democrats foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gerhard meanwhile called the hanging of saddam " unacceptable , " and said a life sentence would have set a milestone . left party spokesman gregor gysi said the execution " did not mark the start of greater democracy in iraq . " greens spokesman fritz kuhn said iraqis needed to draw a line under the " chain of death and revenge . " saturday 's execution hides the danger that supporters of saddam hussein will in future regard the ex-dictator as a martyr , " kuhn said . europe condemns death penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein remained defiant during his trial in past months others in europe also commented on the execution . " the eu condemns the crimes committed by saddam and also the death penalty , " cristina gallach , a spokeswoman for javier solana , the eu high representative for foreign affairs , told news agency afp . france , a staunch opponent of the death penalty as well as the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , called on iraqis to work towards reconciliation and national unity after the execution . " france calls upon all iraqis to look towards the future and work towards reconciliation and national unity , " the french foreign ministry said in a statement .
" now more than ever , the objective should be a return to full sovereignty and stability in iraq .
vatican : " tragic news " the vatican called the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein tragic , saying it could feed a spirit of vengeance .
" there is a risk that it feeds the spirit of vengeance and plants the seeds for fresh violence , " vatican spokesman frederico lombardi said . the hanging of saddam hussein , early on saturday , was " tragic news " , he said on vatican radio .
" this is a reason for sadness , even if this is about a person who is guilty of serious crimes .
the position of the catholic church , which is against the death penalty whatever the circumstances , needs to be repeated again , " he said .

" now more than ever , the objective should be a return to full sovereignty and stability in iraq .
vatican : " tragic news " the vatican called the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein tragic , saying it could feed a spirit of vengeance .

the execution of saddam hussein in the early hours of the muslim sacrificial festival id el adha must have come as a release for former victims of his nearly 30-year reign of terror who did n't find peace even after the ousting of saddam .
the hanging will also likely end any remaining illusions and hopes that saddam 's supporters may have had that history could be rewritten and that lost power could be restored . it seems that the swift execution of saddam 's death sentence was meant primarily to serve these two groups .
the new iraqi leadership considers it appropriate to draw a line under the saddam era as quickly as possible .
so much so that the execution appeared over-hasty und did n't necessarily correspond with legal fundaments .
rather , the speedy hanging appeared to have been carried out to demonstrate the iraqi government 's own power which was called into question by the americans themselves in recent weeks . maliki 's government will have to live with this burden of doubt .
whether it damages the government will very much depend on how the country reacts to the execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we certainly ca n't expect an immediate calm in the country and it remains to be seen whether that will happen in the long term .
but there 's enough reason to believe it wo n't happen .
the differences between the various groups who bomb themselves through daily life in iraq are too huge and saddam had already become too marginal for his death to suddenly change things . a missed historic chance but the quick elimination of saddam means iraq has missed a historic chance to thoroughly deal with and come to grips with his reign of terror . despite all the problems , the legal process was the right way : saddam hussein was to be held guilty for the crimes of his regime .
he was convicted for the murder of 148 shiites , but what about the 100,000 dead and those persecuted in the anfal campaign ?
what about the murdered kurds of halabja , the murdered shiites of the kuwait war ?
what about the hundreds of thousands of victims of the wars that saddam started , particularly against iran but also against kuwait ? without the main suspect , these questions will likely remain unanswered .
saddam 's end is not necessarily a hopeful new beginning for iraq .

a lust for power matched by a ruthless streak had brought saddam to the helm he determined never to leave , whatever the cost . us soldiers who guarded him in prison told a us magazine last year that saddam was an " oddly endearing crazy man " who still called himself the president and remained convinced the people still loved him . less than two years earlier , however , iraqis called for his death when us civilian administrator paul bremer announced saddam 's capture to the world using the dramatic words " ladies and gentlemen , we got him . " on november 5 , saddam finally learned what he must have known would be his inevitable fate : death by hanging , the fate of a common criminal , rather than his stated preference for the firing squad , which is reserved for soldiers . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

champagne bottles pop and couples kiss when the clock strikes midnight .
the dawn of a new year offers people the promise of positive change . we all do it .
when a new year draws near , we vow we 're going to lose weight , stop smoking , drink less , exercise more , be nicer to other people , look for a new job , do good deeds , call our mothers more often , say " i love you " to those who matter . robert tyminski , a san francisco-based psychologist , said all those new year 's resolutions have to do with seasonal changes and their effects on our psyches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new year 's fireworks " we 've entered a period characterized by less daylight and more darkness , and this change serves to remind us that life is a cycle with beginnings and endings , " he said . " the new year often makes us believe we can put the troubling aspects of our lives behind us and begin anew . " resolution tips the internet is full of sites that offer advice on keeping those resolutions .
most of them tell people to keep their feet firmly on the ground when making the goals .
winning the lottery , says ehow.com , is " out of your grasp . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many resolve at new year 's to lose weight instead of shooting for the near unattainable or resolving to change a major behavior pattern overnight , come up with a strategy that stays specific .
instead of resolving to " not be lazy , " something like " i want to exercise more " has a better chance of success . even better : name three days a week on which you will exercise for one hour , the site recommends . another positive " ehow " tip : " find alternatives to a behavior you want to change and make it part of your resolution plan . "
if smoking helped you to relax in the past , and you want to quit smoking , find another way to relax and practice that regularly . unrealistic expectations but making resolutions is a tricky business .
for all the promise of a new beginning with the new year , many psychologists say that setting goals too high is the surest way to fall short . " when resolutions are out of proportion to what is realistic for our circumstances , they can set someone up for a fall , " said tyminski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resolutions are personal goals to keep us on track - or intact he generally gets a flood of calls around late january and early february from people seeking help because they have been let down by resolutions made but not kept . the blues can even set in on new year 's eve since it 's a time people tend to take stock of the year just passed - at least before the champagne really starts to flow .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . violence creates more violence !
as an american , i am deeply troubled by the execution .
i feel we took the place of pontius pilate !
saddam should have been tried by an international court .
handing him over to the shiites caused an unjust trial , a short appeal which became a farce , and an execution , that is an affront to human dignity .
as an iraqi , i would fear those responsible for his death as much as once saddam !
it 's a " milestone " in more misery . - elisabeth heptner , us i do not feel it was a prudent move , but the bush regime does n't think through the big picture .
i see nothing more than blood shed .
a country that is attacked under false pretenses reserves the right to defend itself and suddenly they are terrorists , killed or whisked away to be inhumanely humiliated and tortured .
there needs to be intervention .
this will only get worse . - kathy wittig , us perhaps the early execution of hussein will send a signal to other potential aggressors that they may be punished after fair trial .
even the dictator could at last lament on his fate today , that if he had not pushed iraq into the wars , he would not now be walking the last steps as a disowned former tyrant . - p aul lang as a german citizen who lives in the us , i get the feeling that perhaps i 've become a bit to americanized -lrb- maybe it 's the constant violent crime here -rrb- .i think there are people on this earth who deserve to die , and hussein was certainly one .
maybe a more just punishment would be to let him loose into a crowd of all the victims , and the relatives of victims that he brutalized over the years .
justice in the basest sense of the word .
i hope it brings some type of closure to all those he tortured , raped , degraded , orphaned and murdered . - eva-maria barry saddam hussein 's trial and execution were both gross travesties of justice .
those countries that either actively or passively supported the act of capital punishment upon saddam hussein could be seen as colluding in murder .
not a positive outcome ! - m aureen t. couch that was the wrong thing , at the wrong time , in the wrong place .
i think the price will be high for the american project in the middle east and much higher for the government in iraq . - a iman yunes there are many compelling reasons to oppose the death penalty .
and there is plenty of hypocrisy to go around .
but does that nullify justice ?
will the death of saddam bring about reconciliation ?
of course not !
reconciliation is the goal of the living .
saddam has taken this option away from hundreds of his own citizens !
the perpetrator of genocide -lrb- the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national , racial , political , or cultural group -rrb- should not be treated with pity .
saddam 's trial , in accordance with the law , treated him fairly .
saddam has sentenced many to death .
now he has gotten the sentence he deserves . - e ric letourneau saddam got what he deserved .
god bless the usa - mb harvey when will the violence stop ?
executing saddam hussein solves nothing but will only create more violence . - bruce hoyer i believe that taking his life for the lives of the 148 shiite muslims in 1982 is a scam .
it is the us government 's attempt to distract the world in its shameful and distasteful attempt at controlling and occupying the second largest oil producing nation in the world .
kim jong ii , admits he has nuclear capabilities , but there 's no mention of an invasion of north korea , and he is far worse than saddam hussein .
my question is : why ca n't anyone find the admitted killer , osama bin laden ? - rich , us are we really growing spiritually by cheering somebody 's death , like some viewers in a football field ?
or are we going back in our human nature showing a total lack of a affection for the life itself , many lives were lost along the world history for sure .

" we respect the verdict , but the german government is known to be opposed in principle to the death penalty , " merkel said in berlin on saturday after iraqi officials executed saddam in baghdad by hanging earlier that day . the chancellor added that her thoughts were with the many innocent victims of saddam 's regime . " i hope the iraqi people will be able to go their own way in peace and without violence , " she said . saddam had been sentenced to death for ordering the murder of 148 men and boys in the shiite village of dujail in 1982 . opposition politicians also criticized the execution .
free democrats foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gerhard meanwhile called the hanging of saddam " unacceptable , " and said a life sentence would have set a milestone . left party spokesman gregor gysi said the execution " did not mark the start of greater democracy in iraq . " greens spokesman fritz kuhn said iraqis needed to draw a line under the " chain of death and revenge . " saturday 's execution hides the danger that supporters of saddam hussein will in future regard the ex-dictator as a martyr , " kuhn said . europe condemns death penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein remained defiant during his trial in past months others in europe also commented on the execution . " the eu condemns the crimes committed by saddam and also the death penalty , " cristina gallach , a spokeswoman for javier solana , the eu high representative for foreign affairs , told news agency afp . france , a staunch opponent of the death penalty as well as the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , called on iraqis to work towards reconciliation and national unity after the execution . " france calls upon all iraqis to look towards the future and work towards reconciliation and national unity , " the french foreign ministry said in a statement .
" now more than ever , the objective should be a return to full sovereignty and stability in iraq .
vatican : " tragic news " the vatican called the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein tragic , saying it could feed a spirit of vengeance .
" there is a risk that it feeds the spirit of vengeance and plants the seeds for fresh violence , " vatican spokesman frederico lombardi said . the hanging of saddam hussein , early on saturday , was " tragic news " , he said on vatican radio .
" this is a reason for sadness , even if this is about a person who is guilty of serious crimes .
the position of the catholic church , which is against the death penalty whatever the circumstances , needs to be repeated again , " he said .
" putting a guilty person to death is not the way to rebuild justice and reconcile society , " lombardi added . britain : saddam ' held to account ' britain on saturday said saddam hussein had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the use of the death penalty .
" i welcome the fact that saddam hussein has been tried by an iraqi court for at least some of the appalling crimes he committed against the iraqi people , " said foreign secretary margaret beckett . " he has now been held to account . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain still has over 7,000 soldiers in iraq britain was the us ' main ally during the 2003 invasion of iraq and still has some 7,200 troops in the country .
saddam 's execution has put blair 's government in a difficult position however because of its opposition to the death penalty .
" the british government does not support the use of the death penalty , in iraq or anywhere else , " beckett said .
" we advocate an end to the death penalty worldwide , regardless of the individual or the crime .
" we have made our position very clear to the iraqi authorities , but we respect their decision as that of a sovereign nation , " she added . " iraq continues to face huge challenges .
but now it has a democratically-elected government which represents all communities and is committed to fostering reconciliation . " bush : " an important milestone " us president george w. bush meanwhile hailed saddam hussein 's execution as " an important milestone " on the road to building an iraqi democracy but warned it would not end deadly violence there .
" saddam hussein 's execution comes at the end of a difficult year for the iraqi people and for our troops , " bush said in a statement released as he prepared to usher in 2007 at his texas ranch . human rights group condemns hanging however us-based rights group human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- condemned the hanging , saying history would judge saddam 's trial and execution " harshly . " " saddam hussein was responsible for horrific , widespread human rights violations , but those acts , however brutal , can not justify his execution , a cruel and inhuman punishment , " said hrw 's international justice program director , richard dicker .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . violence creates more violence !
as an american , i am deeply troubled by the execution .
i feel we took the place of pontius pilate !
saddam should have been tried by an international court .
handing him over to the shiites caused an unjust trial , a short appeal which became a farce , and an execution , that is an affront to human dignity .
as an iraqi , i would fear those responsible for his death as much as once saddam !
it 's a " milestone " in more misery . - elisabeth heptner , us i do not feel it was a prudent move , but the bush regime does n't think through the big picture .
i see nothing more than blood shed .
a country that is attacked under false pretenses reserves the right to defend itself and suddenly they are terrorists , killed or whisked away to be inhumanely humiliated and tortured .
there needs to be intervention .
this will only get worse . - kathy wittig , us perhaps the early execution of hussein will send a signal to other potential aggressors that they may be punished after fair trial .
even the dictator could at last lament on his fate today , that if he had not pushed iraq into the wars , he would not now be walking the last steps as a disowned former tyrant . - p aul lang as a german citizen who lives in the us , i get the feeling that perhaps i 've become a bit to americanized -lrb- maybe it 's the constant violent crime here -rrb- .i think there are people on this earth who deserve to die , and hussein was certainly one .
maybe a more just punishment would be to let him loose into a crowd of all the victims , and the relatives of victims that he brutalized over the years .
justice in the basest sense of the word .
i hope it brings some type of closure to all those he tortured , raped , degraded , orphaned and murdered . - eva-maria barry saddam hussein 's trial and execution were both gross travesties of justice .
those countries that either actively or passively supported the act of capital punishment upon saddam hussein could be seen as colluding in murder .
not a positive outcome ! - m aureen t. couch that was the wrong thing , at the wrong time , in the wrong place .
i think the price will be high for the american project in the middle east and much higher for the government in iraq . - a iman yunes there are many compelling reasons to oppose the death penalty .
and there is plenty of hypocrisy to go around .
but does that nullify justice ?
will the death of saddam bring about reconciliation ?
of course not !
reconciliation is the goal of the living .
saddam has taken this option away from hundreds of his own citizens !
the perpetrator of genocide -lrb- the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national , racial , political , or cultural group -rrb- should not be treated with pity .
saddam 's trial , in accordance with the law , treated him fairly .
saddam has sentenced many to death .
now he has gotten the sentence he deserves . - e ric letourneau saddam got what he deserved .
god bless the usa - mb harvey when will the violence stop ?
executing saddam hussein solves nothing but will only create more violence . - bruce hoyer i believe that taking his life for the lives of the 148 shiite muslims in 1982 is a scam .
it is the us government 's attempt to distract the world in its shameful and distasteful attempt at controlling and occupying the second largest oil producing nation in the world .
kim jong ii , admits he has nuclear capabilities , but there 's no mention of an invasion of north korea , and he is far worse than saddam hussein .
my question is : why ca n't anyone find the admitted killer , osama bin laden ? - rich , us are we really growing spiritually by cheering somebody 's death , like some viewers in a football field ?
or are we going back in our human nature showing a total lack of a affection for the life itself , many lives were lost along the world history for sure .

" malignant narcissism " under his leadership from 1979 to 2003 , the baath regime ordered army deserters ' ears cut off , sentenced foreign currency traffickers to death and reportedly beheaded dozens of women for prostitution . a former cia psychologist once described saddam as suffering from " malignant narcissism , " exhibiting an extreme lack of empathy and a will to use violence , which he attributed to a troubled upbringing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein unleashed a reign of terror born poor in a mud-hut village near tikrit on april 28 , 1937 , saddam was orphaned at a young age and raised by an uncle who idolised adolf hitler .
he overcame his impoverished roots and rose to iraq 's highest office , lived in the grandest of palaces , married three times and fathered six children . in arabic , his name means " the stubborn one " or " he who strikes . "
his self-importance and cult of personality were legendary .
on his 60th birthday he commissioned a copy of the koran to be inscribed in his own blood . saddam also groomed two of his sons , uday and qusay , in his own image .
they became feared for their use of torture and rape .
the two were killed during a fire fight with us forces in the northern city of mosul in july 2003 , five months before their father was captured in a farmyard hole in the ground . ruling with an iron fist saddam , who worked in the baath party security apparatus , first made a name for himself by trying to murder iraqi leader abdul karim kassem in 1959 . wounded in the leg , the future dictator fled abroad but returned four years later and was jailed in 1964 .
within two years he had escaped and resumed clandestine work for the baath party .
in 1968 he took part in the coup that brought the party to power , marking another step in his affair with brute force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discovery of a mass grave in mahaweel , south of baghdad , in 2003 as party deputy secretary general and vice president of the all-powerful revolution command council -lrb- rcc -rrb- , he was already considered the real power behind president ahmed hassan al-bakr .
bakr lost his grip over the next decade as saddam strengthened his own , and the president finally retired for health reasons . saddam seized the mantle on july 16 , 1979 , becoming state president , general secretary of the party and president of the rcc .
in the years that followed , the modern arab state labelled the cradle of civilisation became an impoverished pariah , its fabulous oil wealth squandered . saddam guided iraq through a 1980-1988 bloodbath with iran and the rout of the 1991 gulf war over kuwait , emerging each time to claim pyrrhic victories over the corpses of his people .
he defied attempts through the united nations to ensure his disarmament - the organisation 's crushing sanctions and four nights of us and british missile strikes in december 1998 . saddam extended frequent purges of senior figures to family and friends .
those who failed to make it into exile were detained , murdered and buried in the mass graves that have been uncovered across the country . a humiliating end since his sensational capture by american troops in a hole in a ground in iraq in december 2003 , images of saddam as a gaunt and greying prisoner have been splashed across the world - with some controversial photographs even showing him just in his underwear . the 69-year-old arab nationalist , who once declared his determination to die at home and taunted enemies with outrageous bravado , was toppled days after the us-led invasion began in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous toppling of the saddam statue in 2003 his massive statue in central baghdad was pulled down on april 9 , and nine months later saddam was discovered , long-haired , bearded and bedraggled , in an underground crawlspace near tikrit . his ability to evade capture for so long was evidence of the profound influence he exerted over his people even after his ouster , as many ordinary iraqis shrank from cooperating with the occupier for fear of saddam 's return . but others saw him as a strong leader who rained inaccurate but psychologically damaging scud rockets on israel and at least briefly restored self-respect to the arab nation . nevertheless , saddam 's reign ended in defeat , his ubiquitous portraits torn down and destroyed after the occupation of his capital .
a lust for power matched by a ruthless streak had brought saddam to the helm he determined never to leave , whatever the cost . us soldiers who guarded him in prison told a us magazine last year that saddam was an " oddly endearing crazy man " who still called himself the president and remained convinced the people still loved him . less than two years earlier , however , iraqis called for his death when us civilian administrator paul bremer announced saddam 's capture to the world using the dramatic words " ladies and gentlemen , we got him . " on november 5 , saddam finally learned what he must have known would be his inevitable fate : death by hanging , the fate of a common criminal , rather than his stated preference for the firing squad , which is reserved for soldiers . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the execution of saddam hussein in the early hours of the muslim sacrificial festival id el adha must have come as a release for former victims of his nearly 30-year reign of terror who did n't find peace even after the ousting of saddam .
the hanging will also likely end any remaining illusions and hopes that saddam 's supporters may have had that history could be rewritten and that lost power could be restored . it seems that the swift execution of saddam 's death sentence was meant primarily to serve these two groups .
the new iraqi leadership considers it appropriate to draw a line under the saddam era as quickly as possible .
so much so that the execution appeared over-hasty und did n't necessarily correspond with legal fundaments .
rather , the speedy hanging appeared to have been carried out to demonstrate the iraqi government 's own power which was called into question by the americans themselves in recent weeks . maliki 's government will have to live with this burden of doubt .
whether it damages the government will very much depend on how the country reacts to the execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we certainly ca n't expect an immediate calm in the country and it remains to be seen whether that will happen in the long term .
but there 's enough reason to believe it wo n't happen .
the differences between the various groups who bomb themselves through daily life in iraq are too huge and saddam had already become too marginal for his death to suddenly change things . a missed historic chance but the quick elimination of saddam means iraq has missed a historic chance to thoroughly deal with and come to grips with his reign of terror . despite all the problems , the legal process was the right way : saddam hussein was to be held guilty for the crimes of his regime .
he was convicted for the murder of 148 shiites , but what about the 100,000 dead and those persecuted in the anfal campaign ?
what about the murdered kurds of halabja , the murdered shiites of the kuwait war ?
what about the hundreds of thousands of victims of the wars that saddam started , particularly against iran but also against kuwait ? without the main suspect , these questions will likely remain unanswered .
saddam 's end is not necessarily a hopeful new beginning for iraq .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . violence creates more violence !
as an american , i am deeply troubled by the execution .
i feel we took the place of pontius pilate !
saddam should have been tried by an international court .
handing him over to the shiites caused an unjust trial , a short appeal which became a farce , and an execution , that is an affront to human dignity .
as an iraqi , i would fear those responsible for his death as much as once saddam !
it 's a " milestone " in more misery . - elisabeth heptner , us i do not feel it was a prudent move , but the bush regime does n't think through the big picture .
i see nothing more than blood shed .
a country that is attacked under false pretenses reserves the right to defend itself and suddenly they are terrorists , killed or whisked away to be inhumanely humiliated and tortured .
there needs to be intervention .
this will only get worse . - kathy wittig , us perhaps the early execution of hussein will send a signal to other potential aggressors that they may be punished after fair trial .
even the dictator could at last lament on his fate today , that if he had not pushed iraq into the wars , he would not now be walking the last steps as a disowned former tyrant . - p aul lang as a german citizen who lives in the us , i get the feeling that perhaps i 've become a bit to americanized -lrb- maybe it 's the constant violent crime here -rrb- .i think there are people on this earth who deserve to die , and hussein was certainly one .
maybe a more just punishment would be to let him loose into a crowd of all the victims , and the relatives of victims that he brutalized over the years .
justice in the basest sense of the word .
i hope it brings some type of closure to all those he tortured , raped , degraded , orphaned and murdered . - eva-maria barry saddam hussein 's trial and execution were both gross travesties of justice .
those countries that either actively or passively supported the act of capital punishment upon saddam hussein could be seen as colluding in murder .
not a positive outcome ! - m aureen t. couch that was the wrong thing , at the wrong time , in the wrong place .
i think the price will be high for the american project in the middle east and much higher for the government in iraq . - a iman yunes there are many compelling reasons to oppose the death penalty .
and there is plenty of hypocrisy to go around .
but does that nullify justice ?
will the death of saddam bring about reconciliation ?
of course not !
reconciliation is the goal of the living .
saddam has taken this option away from hundreds of his own citizens !
the perpetrator of genocide -lrb- the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national , racial , political , or cultural group -rrb- should not be treated with pity .
saddam 's trial , in accordance with the law , treated him fairly .
saddam has sentenced many to death .
now he has gotten the sentence he deserves . - e ric letourneau saddam got what he deserved .
god bless the usa - mb harvey when will the violence stop ?
executing saddam hussein solves nothing but will only create more violence . - bruce hoyer i believe that taking his life for the lives of the 148 shiite muslims in 1982 is a scam .
it is the us government 's attempt to distract the world in its shameful and distasteful attempt at controlling and occupying the second largest oil producing nation in the world .
kim jong ii , admits he has nuclear capabilities , but there 's no mention of an invasion of north korea , and he is far worse than saddam hussein .
my question is : why ca n't anyone find the admitted killer , osama bin laden ? - rich , us are we really growing spiritually by cheering somebody 's death , like some viewers in a football field ?
or are we going back in our human nature showing a total lack of a affection for the life itself , many lives were lost along the world history for sure .
but will this single event demonstrate who we really are ?

in 1968 he took part in the coup that brought the party to power , marking another step in his affair with brute force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discovery of a mass grave in mahaweel , south of baghdad , in 2003 as party deputy secretary general and vice president of the all-powerful revolution command council -lrb- rcc -rrb- , he was already considered the real power behind president ahmed hassan al-bakr .
bakr lost his grip over the next decade as saddam strengthened his own , and the president finally retired for health reasons . saddam seized the mantle on july 16 , 1979 , becoming state president , general secretary of the party and president of the rcc .
in the years that followed , the modern arab state labelled the cradle of civilisation became an impoverished pariah , its fabulous oil wealth squandered . saddam guided iraq through a 1980-1988 bloodbath with iran and the rout of the 1991 gulf war over kuwait , emerging each time to claim pyrrhic victories over the corpses of his people .
he defied attempts through the united nations to ensure his disarmament - the organisation 's crushing sanctions and four nights of us and british missile strikes in december 1998 . saddam extended frequent purges of senior figures to family and friends .
those who failed to make it into exile were detained , murdered and buried in the mass graves that have been uncovered across the country . a humiliating end since his sensational capture by american troops in a hole in a ground in iraq in december 2003 , images of saddam as a gaunt and greying prisoner have been splashed across the world - with some controversial photographs even showing him just in his underwear . the 69-year-old arab nationalist , who once declared his determination to die at home and taunted enemies with outrageous bravado , was toppled days after the us-led invasion began in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous toppling of the saddam statue in 2003 his massive statue in central baghdad was pulled down on april 9 , and nine months later saddam was discovered , long-haired , bearded and bedraggled , in an underground crawlspace near tikrit . his ability to evade capture for so long was evidence of the profound influence he exerted over his people even after his ouster , as many ordinary iraqis shrank from cooperating with the occupier for fear of saddam 's return . but others saw him as a strong leader who rained inaccurate but psychologically damaging scud rockets on israel and at least briefly restored self-respect to the arab nation . nevertheless , saddam 's reign ended in defeat , his ubiquitous portraits torn down and destroyed after the occupation of his capital .
a lust for power matched by a ruthless streak had brought saddam to the helm he determined never to leave , whatever the cost . us soldiers who guarded him in prison told a us magazine last year that saddam was an " oddly endearing crazy man " who still called himself the president and remained convinced the people still loved him . less than two years earlier , however , iraqis called for his death when us civilian administrator paul bremer announced saddam 's capture to the world using the dramatic words " ladies and gentlemen , we got him . " on november 5 , saddam finally learned what he must have known would be his inevitable fate : death by hanging , the fate of a common criminal , rather than his stated preference for the firing squad , which is reserved for soldiers . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.12.2006 opinion : a missed historic chance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp says that the execution of saddam hussein makes it impossible to continue with the process of dealing with and coming to terms with his reign of terror in iraq . it would be misplaced to feel sympathy for a man who himself did n't know the meaning of the word and who spent a part of his life brutally crushing those who stood in his way and who was responsible for the suffering and death of thousands of people .
the execution of saddam hussein in the early hours of the muslim sacrificial festival id el adha must have come as a release for former victims of his nearly 30-year reign of terror who did n't find peace even after the ousting of saddam .
the hanging will also likely end any remaining illusions and hopes that saddam 's supporters may have had that history could be rewritten and that lost power could be restored . it seems that the swift execution of saddam 's death sentence was meant primarily to serve these two groups .
the new iraqi leadership considers it appropriate to draw a line under the saddam era as quickly as possible .
so much so that the execution appeared over-hasty und did n't necessarily correspond with legal fundaments .
rather , the speedy hanging appeared to have been carried out to demonstrate the iraqi government 's own power which was called into question by the americans themselves in recent weeks . maliki 's government will have to live with this burden of doubt .
whether it damages the government will very much depend on how the country reacts to the execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we certainly ca n't expect an immediate calm in the country and it remains to be seen whether that will happen in the long term .
but there 's enough reason to believe it wo n't happen .
the differences between the various groups who bomb themselves through daily life in iraq are too huge and saddam had already become too marginal for his death to suddenly change things . a missed historic chance but the quick elimination of saddam means iraq has missed a historic chance to thoroughly deal with and come to grips with his reign of terror . despite all the problems , the legal process was the right way : saddam hussein was to be held guilty for the crimes of his regime .
he was convicted for the murder of 148 shiites , but what about the 100,000 dead and those persecuted in the anfal campaign ?
what about the murdered kurds of halabja , the murdered shiites of the kuwait war ?
what about the hundreds of thousands of victims of the wars that saddam started , particularly against iran but also against kuwait ? without the main suspect , these questions will likely remain unanswered .
saddam 's end is not necessarily a hopeful new beginning for iraq .

" there is an agreement on the price of gas delivered to belarus and on the price for transit " to europe , belarus governmment spokesman alexander timoshenko said . but a gazprom spokesman said that it was " premature " to talk of an agreement and stressed that a deal had yet to be signed . on friday , belarus ' president alexander lukashenko had said that his country was not going to " yield to russia 's gas blackmail . " if this blackmail continues , we will take shelter in bunkers but we will not give in , " lukashenko said on national radio less than three days before the expiry of an ultimatum to accept higher prices or see supplies cut off . sergei kyprianov , a gazprom spokesman , meanwhile told russian television that the belarussian delegation was at the state-controlled gas giant 's headquarters . " negotiations continue but for the moment there is no result . " price increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus has said the country will buckle down , but not give in currently , belarus pays $ 46.68 dollars -lrb- 35.5 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic meters - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic meters in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . sandwiched between russia and the european union , belarus has threatened to retaliate to the gas hike by refusing to allow the transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies to germany , lithuania and poland . without a contract for its own supplies , minsk argues , there can be no contract on transit , while gazprom claims belarus is preparing to dip into transiting gas should its domestic supply be cut off . " we are in the final phase of negotiations .
but we can not drag -lrb- the decision -rrb- out any more , " kypryanov said , warning minsk of the " serious consequences " for the belarussian economy of a cut in supplies . " blackmail " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas compressor station in belarus in an interview friday with the french newspaper le figaro gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev accused minsk of " grotesque blackmail " in threatening a cut in supplies to europe and spoke of a possible " rationing " leading to " shortages " in the eu .
about 5 percent of gas consumed in the eu transits through belarus . the conflict echoes last year 's winter price war between russia and ukraine over the supply and cost of gas which led to shortages in western europe .
but then the west supported pro-western president viktor yushchenko , while lukashenko has been accused by washington of running the " last dictatorship in europe . " the eu has limited itself to calling on the two parties to reach a deal that does not threaten gas transit to the west and french and german authorities have said they are not worried by the prospect of a shortage . ukraine announced on thursday its readiness to increase the transit of russian gas through its territory in case of possible disruptions on the belarus route . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .

dw-world.de readers comment on the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
while some seem to think he got what he deserved , others wrote that his death might provoke further violence . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . violence creates more violence !
as an american , i am deeply troubled by the execution .
i feel we took the place of pontius pilate !
saddam should have been tried by an international court .
handing him over to the shiites caused an unjust trial , a short appeal which became a farce , and an execution , that is an affront to human dignity .
as an iraqi , i would fear those responsible for his death as much as once saddam !
it 's a " milestone " in more misery . - elisabeth heptner , us i do not feel it was a prudent move , but the bush regime does n't think through the big picture .
i see nothing more than blood shed .
a country that is attacked under false pretenses reserves the right to defend itself and suddenly they are terrorists , killed or whisked away to be inhumanely humiliated and tortured .
there needs to be intervention .
this will only get worse . - kathy wittig , us perhaps the early execution of hussein will send a signal to other potential aggressors that they may be punished after fair trial .
even the dictator could at last lament on his fate today , that if he had not pushed iraq into the wars , he would not now be walking the last steps as a disowned former tyrant . - p aul lang as a german citizen who lives in the us , i get the feeling that perhaps i 've become a bit to americanized -lrb- maybe it 's the constant violent crime here -rrb- .i think there are people on this earth who deserve to die , and hussein was certainly one .
maybe a more just punishment would be to let him loose into a crowd of all the victims , and the relatives of victims that he brutalized over the years .
justice in the basest sense of the word .
i hope it brings some type of closure to all those he tortured , raped , degraded , orphaned and murdered . - eva-maria barry saddam hussein 's trial and execution were both gross travesties of justice .
those countries that either actively or passively supported the act of capital punishment upon saddam hussein could be seen as colluding in murder .
not a positive outcome ! - m aureen t. couch that was the wrong thing , at the wrong time , in the wrong place .
i think the price will be high for the american project in the middle east and much higher for the government in iraq . - a iman yunes there are many compelling reasons to oppose the death penalty .
and there is plenty of hypocrisy to go around .
but does that nullify justice ?
will the death of saddam bring about reconciliation ?
of course not !
reconciliation is the goal of the living .
saddam has taken this option away from hundreds of his own citizens !
the perpetrator of genocide -lrb- the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national , racial , political , or cultural group -rrb- should not be treated with pity .
saddam 's trial , in accordance with the law , treated him fairly .
saddam has sentenced many to death .
now he has gotten the sentence he deserves . - e ric letourneau saddam got what he deserved .
god bless the usa - mb harvey when will the violence stop ?
executing saddam hussein solves nothing but will only create more violence . - bruce hoyer i believe that taking his life for the lives of the 148 shiite muslims in 1982 is a scam .
it is the us government 's attempt to distract the world in its shameful and distasteful attempt at controlling and occupying the second largest oil producing nation in the world .
kim jong ii , admits he has nuclear capabilities , but there 's no mention of an invasion of north korea , and he is far worse than saddam hussein .
my question is : why ca n't anyone find the admitted killer , osama bin laden ? - rich , us are we really growing spiritually by cheering somebody 's death , like some viewers in a football field ?
or are we going back in our human nature showing a total lack of a affection for the life itself , many lives were lost along the world history for sure .
but will this single event demonstrate who we really are ?
well , only god knows it . - cezar compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel on hussein execution : " we respect the verdict " saying that iraqis have missed a chance to deal with its past and might now face further violence , german and other european leaders on saturday criticized the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .

" we respect the verdict , but the german government is known to be opposed in principle to the death penalty , " merkel said in berlin on saturday after iraqi officials executed saddam in baghdad by hanging earlier that day . the chancellor added that her thoughts were with the many innocent victims of saddam 's regime . " i hope the iraqi people will be able to go their own way in peace and without violence , " she said . saddam had been sentenced to death for ordering the murder of 148 men and boys in the shiite village of dujail in 1982 . opposition politicians also criticized the execution .
free democrats foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gerhard meanwhile called the hanging of saddam " unacceptable , " and said a life sentence would have set a milestone . left party spokesman gregor gysi said the execution " did not mark the start of greater democracy in iraq . " greens spokesman fritz kuhn said iraqis needed to draw a line under the " chain of death and revenge . " saturday 's execution hides the danger that supporters of saddam hussein will in future regard the ex-dictator as a martyr , " kuhn said . europe condemns death penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein remained defiant during his trial in past months others in europe also commented on the execution . " the eu condemns the crimes committed by saddam and also the death penalty , " cristina gallach , a spokeswoman for javier solana , the eu high representative for foreign affairs , told news agency afp . france , a staunch opponent of the death penalty as well as the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , called on iraqis to work towards reconciliation and national unity after the execution .

" this is a reason for sadness , even if this is about a person who is guilty of serious crimes .
the position of the catholic church , which is against the death penalty whatever the circumstances , needs to be repeated again , " he said .
" putting a guilty person to death is not the way to rebuild justice and reconcile society , " lombardi added . britain : saddam ' held to account ' britain on saturday said saddam hussein had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the use of the death penalty .
" i welcome the fact that saddam hussein has been tried by an iraqi court for at least some of the appalling crimes he committed against the iraqi people , " said foreign secretary margaret beckett .

saddam 's execution has put blair 's government in a difficult position however because of its opposition to the death penalty .
" the british government does not support the use of the death penalty , in iraq or anywhere else , " beckett said .
" we advocate an end to the death penalty worldwide , regardless of the individual or the crime .
" we have made our position very clear to the iraqi authorities , but we respect their decision as that of a sovereign nation , " she added . " iraq continues to face huge challenges .
but now it has a democratically-elected government which represents all communities and is committed to fostering reconciliation . " bush : " an important milestone " us president george w. bush meanwhile hailed saddam hussein 's execution as " an important milestone " on the road to building an iraqi democracy but warned it would not end deadly violence there .
" saddam hussein 's execution comes at the end of a difficult year for the iraqi people and for our troops , " bush said in a statement released as he prepared to usher in 2007 at his texas ranch . human rights group condemns hanging however us-based rights group human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- condemned the hanging , saying history would judge saddam 's trial and execution " harshly . " " saddam hussein was responsible for horrific , widespread human rights violations , but those acts , however brutal , can not justify his execution , a cruel and inhuman punishment , " said hrw 's international justice program director , richard dicker .
" the test of a government 's commitment to human rights is measured by the way it treats its worst offenders , " he said .

the execution of saddam hussein in the early hours of the muslim sacrificial festival id el adha must have come as a release for former victims of his nearly 30-year reign of terror who did n't find peace even after the ousting of saddam .
the hanging will also likely end any remaining illusions and hopes that saddam 's supporters may have had that history could be rewritten and that lost power could be restored . it seems that the swift execution of saddam 's death sentence was meant primarily to serve these two groups .
the new iraqi leadership considers it appropriate to draw a line under the saddam era as quickly as possible .
so much so that the execution appeared over-hasty und did n't necessarily correspond with legal fundaments .
rather , the speedy hanging appeared to have been carried out to demonstrate the iraqi government 's own power which was called into question by the americans themselves in recent weeks . maliki 's government will have to live with this burden of doubt .
whether it damages the government will very much depend on how the country reacts to the execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we certainly ca n't expect an immediate calm in the country and it remains to be seen whether that will happen in the long term .
but there 's enough reason to believe it wo n't happen .
the differences between the various groups who bomb themselves through daily life in iraq are too huge and saddam had already become too marginal for his death to suddenly change things . a missed historic chance but the quick elimination of saddam means iraq has missed a historic chance to thoroughly deal with and come to grips with his reign of terror . despite all the problems , the legal process was the right way : saddam hussein was to be held guilty for the crimes of his regime .
he was convicted for the murder of 148 shiites , but what about the 100,000 dead and those persecuted in the anfal campaign ?
what about the murdered kurds of halabja , the murdered shiites of the kuwait war ?
what about the hundreds of thousands of victims of the wars that saddam started , particularly against iran but also against kuwait ? without the main suspect , these questions will likely remain unanswered .
saddam 's end is not necessarily a hopeful new beginning for iraq .

" malignant narcissism " under his leadership from 1979 to 2003 , the baath regime ordered army deserters ' ears cut off , sentenced foreign currency traffickers to death and reportedly beheaded dozens of women for prostitution . a former cia psychologist once described saddam as suffering from " malignant narcissism , " exhibiting an extreme lack of empathy and a will to use violence , which he attributed to a troubled upbringing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein unleashed a reign of terror born poor in a mud-hut village near tikrit on april 28 , 1937 , saddam was orphaned at a young age and raised by an uncle who idolised adolf hitler .
he overcame his impoverished roots and rose to iraq 's highest office , lived in the grandest of palaces , married three times and fathered six children . in arabic , his name means " the stubborn one " or " he who strikes . "
his self-importance and cult of personality were legendary .

the execution of saddam hussein in the early hours of the muslim sacrificial festival id el adha must have come as a release for former victims of his nearly 30-year reign of terror who did n't find peace even after the ousting of saddam .
the hanging will also likely end any remaining illusions and hopes that saddam 's supporters may have had that history could be rewritten and that lost power could be restored . it seems that the swift execution of saddam 's death sentence was meant primarily to serve these two groups .
the new iraqi leadership considers it appropriate to draw a line under the saddam era as quickly as possible .
so much so that the execution appeared over-hasty und did n't necessarily correspond with legal fundaments .
rather , the speedy hanging appeared to have been carried out to demonstrate the iraqi government 's own power which was called into question by the americans themselves in recent weeks . maliki 's government will have to live with this burden of doubt .
whether it damages the government will very much depend on how the country reacts to the execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we certainly ca n't expect an immediate calm in the country and it remains to be seen whether that will happen in the long term .
but there 's enough reason to believe it wo n't happen .
the differences between the various groups who bomb themselves through daily life in iraq are too huge and saddam had already become too marginal for his death to suddenly change things . a missed historic chance but the quick elimination of saddam means iraq has missed a historic chance to thoroughly deal with and come to grips with his reign of terror . despite all the problems , the legal process was the right way : saddam hussein was to be held guilty for the crimes of his regime .
he was convicted for the murder of 148 shiites , but what about the 100,000 dead and those persecuted in the anfal campaign ?
what about the murdered kurds of halabja , the murdered shiites of the kuwait war ?
what about the hundreds of thousands of victims of the wars that saddam started , particularly against iran but also against kuwait ? without the main suspect , these questions will likely remain unanswered .

the execution of saddam hussein in the early hours of the muslim sacrificial festival id el adha must have come as a release for former victims of his nearly 30-year reign of terror who did n't find peace even after the ousting of saddam .
the hanging will also likely end any remaining illusions and hopes that saddam 's supporters may have had that history could be rewritten and that lost power could be restored . it seems that the swift execution of saddam 's death sentence was meant primarily to serve these two groups .
the new iraqi leadership considers it appropriate to draw a line under the saddam era as quickly as possible .
so much so that the execution appeared over-hasty und did n't necessarily correspond with legal fundaments .
rather , the speedy hanging appeared to have been carried out to demonstrate the iraqi government 's own power which was called into question by the americans themselves in recent weeks . maliki 's government will have to live with this burden of doubt .
whether it damages the government will very much depend on how the country reacts to the execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we certainly ca n't expect an immediate calm in the country and it remains to be seen whether that will happen in the long term .
but there 's enough reason to believe it wo n't happen .
the differences between the various groups who bomb themselves through daily life in iraq are too huge and saddam had already become too marginal for his death to suddenly change things . a missed historic chance but the quick elimination of saddam means iraq has missed a historic chance to thoroughly deal with and come to grips with his reign of terror . despite all the problems , the legal process was the right way : saddam hussein was to be held guilty for the crimes of his regime .
he was convicted for the murder of 148 shiites , but what about the 100,000 dead and those persecuted in the anfal campaign ?
what about the murdered kurds of halabja , the murdered shiites of the kuwait war ?
what about the hundreds of thousands of victims of the wars that saddam started , particularly against iran but also against kuwait ? without the main suspect , these questions will likely remain unanswered .
saddam 's end is not necessarily a hopeful new beginning for iraq .

bakr lost his grip over the next decade as saddam strengthened his own , and the president finally retired for health reasons . saddam seized the mantle on july 16 , 1979 , becoming state president , general secretary of the party and president of the rcc .
in the years that followed , the modern arab state labelled the cradle of civilisation became an impoverished pariah , its fabulous oil wealth squandered . saddam guided iraq through a 1980-1988 bloodbath with iran and the rout of the 1991 gulf war over kuwait , emerging each time to claim pyrrhic victories over the corpses of his people .
he defied attempts through the united nations to ensure his disarmament - the organisation 's crushing sanctions and four nights of us and british missile strikes in december 1998 . saddam extended frequent purges of senior figures to family and friends .
those who failed to make it into exile were detained , murdered and buried in the mass graves that have been uncovered across the country . a humiliating end since his sensational capture by american troops in a hole in a ground in iraq in december 2003 , images of saddam as a gaunt and greying prisoner have been splashed across the world - with some controversial photographs even showing him just in his underwear . the 69-year-old arab nationalist , who once declared his determination to die at home and taunted enemies with outrageous bravado , was toppled days after the us-led invasion began in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous toppling of the saddam statue in 2003 his massive statue in central baghdad was pulled down on april 9 , and nine months later saddam was discovered , long-haired , bearded and bedraggled , in an underground crawlspace near tikrit . his ability to evade capture for so long was evidence of the profound influence he exerted over his people even after his ouster , as many ordinary iraqis shrank from cooperating with the occupier for fear of saddam 's return . but others saw him as a strong leader who rained inaccurate but psychologically damaging scud rockets on israel and at least briefly restored self-respect to the arab nation . nevertheless , saddam 's reign ended in defeat , his ubiquitous portraits torn down and destroyed after the occupation of his capital .

dw-world.de readers comment on the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
while some seem to think he got what he deserved , others wrote that his death might provoke further violence . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . violence creates more violence !
as an american , i am deeply troubled by the execution .
i feel we took the place of pontius pilate !
saddam should have been tried by an international court .
handing him over to the shiites caused an unjust trial , a short appeal which became a farce , and an execution , that is an affront to human dignity .
as an iraqi , i would fear those responsible for his death as much as once saddam !
it 's a " milestone " in more misery . - elisabeth heptner , us i do not feel it was a prudent move , but the bush regime does n't think through the big picture .
i see nothing more than blood shed .
a country that is attacked under false pretenses reserves the right to defend itself and suddenly they are terrorists , killed or whisked away to be inhumanely humiliated and tortured .
there needs to be intervention .
this will only get worse . - kathy wittig , us perhaps the early execution of hussein will send a signal to other potential aggressors that they may be punished after fair trial .
even the dictator could at last lament on his fate today , that if he had not pushed iraq into the wars , he would not now be walking the last steps as a disowned former tyrant . - p aul lang as a german citizen who lives in the us , i get the feeling that perhaps i 've become a bit to americanized -lrb- maybe it 's the constant violent crime here -rrb- .i think there are people on this earth who deserve to die , and hussein was certainly one .
maybe a more just punishment would be to let him loose into a crowd of all the victims , and the relatives of victims that he brutalized over the years .
justice in the basest sense of the word .
i hope it brings some type of closure to all those he tortured , raped , degraded , orphaned and murdered . - eva-maria barry saddam hussein 's trial and execution were both gross travesties of justice .
those countries that either actively or passively supported the act of capital punishment upon saddam hussein could be seen as colluding in murder .
not a positive outcome ! - m aureen t. couch that was the wrong thing , at the wrong time , in the wrong place .
i think the price will be high for the american project in the middle east and much higher for the government in iraq . - a iman yunes there are many compelling reasons to oppose the death penalty .
and there is plenty of hypocrisy to go around .
but does that nullify justice ?
will the death of saddam bring about reconciliation ?
of course not !
reconciliation is the goal of the living .
saddam has taken this option away from hundreds of his own citizens !
the perpetrator of genocide -lrb- the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national , racial , political , or cultural group -rrb- should not be treated with pity .
saddam 's trial , in accordance with the law , treated him fairly .
saddam has sentenced many to death .
now he has gotten the sentence he deserves . - e ric letourneau saddam got what he deserved .
god bless the usa - mb harvey when will the violence stop ?
executing saddam hussein solves nothing but will only create more violence . - bruce hoyer i believe that taking his life for the lives of the 148 shiite muslims in 1982 is a scam .
it is the us government 's attempt to distract the world in its shameful and distasteful attempt at controlling and occupying the second largest oil producing nation in the world .
kim jong ii , admits he has nuclear capabilities , but there 's no mention of an invasion of north korea , and he is far worse than saddam hussein .
my question is : why ca n't anyone find the admitted killer , osama bin laden ? - rich , us are we really growing spiritually by cheering somebody 's death , like some viewers in a football field ?
or are we going back in our human nature showing a total lack of a affection for the life itself , many lives were lost along the world history for sure .

the german statistics office estimates that around 400,000 women work as prostitutes .
it 's a normal job in germany - at least on paper . with annual turnover estimated at 15 billion euros -lrb- nearly $ 20 billion -rrb- a year , it 's a business that can not be ignored .
european union members states vary in their policies concerning prostitution .
in sweden , prostitutes are fined when caught turning tricks .
the netherlands and germany , however , have pushed for complete legalization , with german prostitutes able to receive vacation and health benefits . the german health ministry intends to soon present its first assessment of the situation since prostitution was legalized three years ago . all the world 's a stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states vary in their prostitution laws prostitutes go about their business in different ways .
in a brothel in hamburg , some young women prance around in stilettos and lingerie in front of potential clients .
one man sits in a red velvet chair with golden armrests , admiring the women .
music videos dancing across a television screen . other prostitutes sit in a back room and wait .
they lounge around on sofas , smoking and eating chips and cookies . natascha , an 18-year-old from russia , has been turning tricks for three months . " i used to go to school , " she said .
" then i quit , did nothing for a couple of years , and after awhile , i thought ' okay , i 'll try it out . " ' " i ended up liking it and decided to stay in hamburg , " she said , taking a drag on her cigarette .
she works six days a week . chantal , who is 28 , does not have to work so much .
she 's a " part-time prostitute . "
she earns her living primarily through a normal job .
it 's enough for her and her son to live on , but she does n't want it that way . " i do n't depend on the money ; it 's just a little extra , " she said .
chantal only circuits the brothel when she has time and is in the mood . freelancers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is shutting down a third of red light businesses to crack down on crime whether they work part or full-time , none of these women are " on staff " at the brothel .
doris , the brothel madame who herself worked as a prostitute for years , said most sex workers are not interested in a contract . " the ladies are only in the business for a short time , " she said .
" here at the brothel in hamburg , they often stay just a year or two .
and they do n't want it down on paper what they do . " as a result , most of the prostitutes have not signed up for health insurance or pension plans . one exception , however , is tamara .
the 23-year-old said sex was always her hobby , so she turned it into a job .
she has registered her job as a sex worker at the local authorities . " once everything became legal , people looked at me a bit strangely , " she said . " but i 'm upfront about everything , and do not receive money from the state - no welfare , no unemployment money , and i pay for my health insurance . " tamara is also saving money for the future , which she believes is essential . gathering figures though german law made it possible three years ago to employ prostitutes as staff - with full benefits - few have taken advantage of it , said social scientist emilya mitrovic , who conducted a survey for the union group verdi . " only those who have been in the business longer want that kind of job because they want a pension , " she said . she also said it is difficult to collect figures since insurance companies only loosely define the jobs of their insured into groups , and not individual types of employment .
in other words , rather than being defined as " prostitute " or " sex worker " in insurance companies ' computer systems , the women on health schemes may simply be in " group 913 , " which also includes hotel and restaurant workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a calling , others as a curse other , private insurance companies do not wish to have their reputations tainted so they do not provide information . " insurance companies are scared of becoming known as insuring prostitutes , " said mitrovic .
" they fear they could lose business . " stuck in a rut yet many of the women themselves feel their job is indecent . theoretically , too , the prostitutes could apply for aid as founders of new businesses , but on a practical level , most do not fulfil the requirements , said mechthild pingler of the hamburg employment agency . the prostitutes ' chances of finding other employment through state-run job placement programs are also slim . " we do not , however , offer prostitution jobs to people , " pingler stressed .
" that protects the unemployed , who through the hartz iv program are otherwise are forced to take any job not deemed ' immoral . " ' pingler has been working with prostitutes for 15 years .
hardly any of the women she knows have taken part in occupational retraining programs since most of them could not easily integrate themselves into another job market . " the biggest problem is that the women have a completely different way of working than in most other jobs , " she said .
" they may have worked hard all their lives , but prostitution is still not your classic nine-to-five job .

there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .
the current economic downturn in the united state will not have a significant affect on germany 's economic growth , because this will be offset by the dynamism of other markets , such as eastern europe , russia , china , india and the middle east . the strong euro also wo n't have an adverse affect .
one the one hand , the financial sector offers enough alternatives to secure against currency fluctuations and on the other hands , an expensive euro makes imports cheaper and helps with stabilizing prices . german firms are n't just achieving record turnovers , but also record profits .
the economy is robust enough to deal with the dip in private consumption expected at the beginning of next year when the 3 percent increase in sales tax is introduced . all of this means germany has an extremely positive economic outlook for 2007 . karl zawadzky is a business editor for dw-radio -lrb- kh -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .
-lrb- 14.12.2006 -rrb- germany 's economic projections bounce back optimism is high in germany after new surveys show an increase in german business confidence after a 13-year low , and forecast greater than expected gdp growth for 2007 .

" you have to imagine it like this : a surgeon stands in front of a real table that resembles an operating table , " said computer scientist torsten kuhlen , who is in charge of the research team developing the virtual operating room . " a video beamer is installed within the table and in conjunction with a pair of ' stereo glasses ' which the surgeon wears , a kind of holographic image of the patient is created , " kuhlen said . the patient , thus , appears as a hologram lying on the " operating table . " simulating reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants must wear goggles to see virtualities for the whole process to work , the conditions in the virtual operating room must emulate real conditions as much as possible .
it 's not enough to depict organs , bones , muscles and sinews .
for the virtual operating room to be useful as a learning tool , the whole body must be visualized , right down to the various layers of the human skin . virtual operating technology must even relay the skin 's resistance in order to create a realistic feel of using a scalpel during surgery . researchers at the computing and communication center in aachen have come up with a solution for that .
a robot holding a scalpel is placed in front of the operating table .
when the surgeon grabs hold of the scalpel and cuts through the virtual skin , the robot generates the tension created by different layers of the human skin . achieving this , however , was no easy task for kuhlen and his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virtual realities are becoming increasingly more complex " to make the situation realistic , the surgeons want the virtual operating room to correspond with real time , " kuhlen said . " we have to use and sometimes develop new , very complex mathematics to create the virtual , yet realistic skin layers .
this complex mathematical rendering has to happen very fast to correspond with real time .
that means up to 60 renderings per second - 60 images are shown per second , " he said . advanced medical technology virtual realities are often used nowadays in the medical field , particularly during training .
doctors also regularly use virtual simulations to help them plan operations . computer scientist lenka yerabkova , however , is convinced that the technology being developed in aachen by far exceeds the currently available systems . " current computers applications in the field of medicine can simulate organs and change their shape , " yerabkova said . " but realistic simulations of cutting through tissue along various lines and at various depths - just like in a classic operation - have not been possible until now , " she said . up-and-coming surgeons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real operating room is a scary place for " practicing " virtual practice could not only dramatically shorten the length of real operations , but also significantly improve the training of young doctors . " a university clinic , of course , has lots of young doctors just starting out who need to be trained , " said timm wolter of aachen 's university clinic . " on the other hand , there is a limited number of patients .
and some types of operations , which are normally standard , are rarely performed in teaching hospitals , " he said . such operations , for instance , could be practiced repeatedly in virtual surgery . computer researchers in aachen are still optimizing their technology .
it will likely be another five years before the first virtual operations can be performed . ingo wagner -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing artificial intelligence on german soccer fields german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.12.2006 opinion : good news for germany 's economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky . for many years , germany 's economy was sluggish compared to other european union countries .
there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .
the current economic downturn in the united state will not have a significant affect on germany 's economic growth , because this will be offset by the dynamism of other markets , such as eastern europe , russia , china , india and the middle east . the strong euro also wo n't have an adverse affect .
one the one hand , the financial sector offers enough alternatives to secure against currency fluctuations and on the other hands , an expensive euro makes imports cheaper and helps with stabilizing prices . german firms are n't just achieving record turnovers , but also record profits .

" you have to imagine it like this : a surgeon stands in front of a real table that resembles an operating table , " said computer scientist torsten kuhlen , who is in charge of the research team developing the virtual operating room . " a video beamer is installed within the table and in conjunction with a pair of ' stereo glasses ' which the surgeon wears , a kind of holographic image of the patient is created , " kuhlen said . the patient , thus , appears as a hologram lying on the " operating table .

it 's not enough to depict organs , bones , muscles and sinews .
for the virtual operating room to be useful as a learning tool , the whole body must be visualized , right down to the various layers of the human skin . virtual operating technology must even relay the skin 's resistance in order to create a realistic feel of using a scalpel during surgery . researchers at the computing and communication center in aachen have come up with a solution for that .
a robot holding a scalpel is placed in front of the operating table .
when the surgeon grabs hold of the scalpel and cuts through the virtual skin , the robot generates the tension created by different layers of the human skin . achieving this , however , was no easy task for kuhlen and his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virtual realities are becoming increasingly more complex " to make the situation realistic , the surgeons want the virtual operating room to correspond with real time , " kuhlen said . " we have to use and sometimes develop new , very complex mathematics to create the virtual , yet realistic skin layers .
this complex mathematical rendering has to happen very fast to correspond with real time .
that means up to 60 renderings per second - 60 images are shown per second , " he said . advanced medical technology virtual realities are often used nowadays in the medical field , particularly during training .
doctors also regularly use virtual simulations to help them plan operations . computer scientist lenka yerabkova , however , is convinced that the technology being developed in aachen by far exceeds the currently available systems . " current computers applications in the field of medicine can simulate organs and change their shape , " yerabkova said . " but realistic simulations of cutting through tissue along various lines and at various depths - just like in a classic operation - have not been possible until now , " she said . up-and-coming surgeons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real operating room is a scary place for " practicing " virtual practice could not only dramatically shorten the length of real operations , but also significantly improve the training of young doctors . " a university clinic , of course , has lots of young doctors just starting out who need to be trained , " said timm wolter of aachen 's university clinic . " on the other hand , there is a limited number of patients .
and some types of operations , which are normally standard , are rarely performed in teaching hospitals , " he said . such operations , for instance , could be practiced repeatedly in virtual surgery . computer researchers in aachen are still optimizing their technology .

the german statistics office estimates that around 400,000 women work as prostitutes .
it 's a normal job in germany - at least on paper . with annual turnover estimated at 15 billion euros -lrb- nearly $ 20 billion -rrb- a year , it 's a business that can not be ignored .
european union members states vary in their policies concerning prostitution .
in sweden , prostitutes are fined when caught turning tricks .
the netherlands and germany , however , have pushed for complete legalization , with german prostitutes able to receive vacation and health benefits . the german health ministry intends to soon present its first assessment of the situation since prostitution was legalized three years ago . all the world 's a stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states vary in their prostitution laws prostitutes go about their business in different ways .
in a brothel in hamburg , some young women prance around in stilettos and lingerie in front of potential clients .
one man sits in a red velvet chair with golden armrests , admiring the women .
music videos dancing across a television screen . other prostitutes sit in a back room and wait .
they lounge around on sofas , smoking and eating chips and cookies . natascha , an 18-year-old from russia , has been turning tricks for three months . " i used to go to school , " she said .
" then i quit , did nothing for a couple of years , and after awhile , i thought ' okay , i 'll try it out . " ' " i ended up liking it and decided to stay in hamburg , " she said , taking a drag on her cigarette .
she works six days a week . chantal , who is 28 , does not have to work so much .
she 's a " part-time prostitute . "
she earns her living primarily through a normal job .
it 's enough for her and her son to live on , but she does n't want it that way . " i do n't depend on the money ; it 's just a little extra , " she said .
chantal only circuits the brothel when she has time and is in the mood . freelancers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is shutting down a third of red light businesses to crack down on crime whether they work part or full-time , none of these women are " on staff " at the brothel .
doris , the brothel madame who herself worked as a prostitute for years , said most sex workers are not interested in a contract . " the ladies are only in the business for a short time , " she said .
" here at the brothel in hamburg , they often stay just a year or two .
and they do n't want it down on paper what they do . " as a result , most of the prostitutes have not signed up for health insurance or pension plans . one exception , however , is tamara .
the 23-year-old said sex was always her hobby , so she turned it into a job .
she has registered her job as a sex worker at the local authorities . " once everything became legal , people looked at me a bit strangely , " she said . " but i 'm upfront about everything , and do not receive money from the state - no welfare , no unemployment money , and i pay for my health insurance . " tamara is also saving money for the future , which she believes is essential . gathering figures though german law made it possible three years ago to employ prostitutes as staff - with full benefits - few have taken advantage of it , said social scientist emilya mitrovic , who conducted a survey for the union group verdi . " only those who have been in the business longer want that kind of job because they want a pension , " she said . she also said it is difficult to collect figures since insurance companies only loosely define the jobs of their insured into groups , and not individual types of employment .
in other words , rather than being defined as " prostitute " or " sex worker " in insurance companies ' computer systems , the women on health schemes may simply be in " group 913 , " which also includes hotel and restaurant workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a calling , others as a curse other , private insurance companies do not wish to have their reputations tainted so they do not provide information . " insurance companies are scared of becoming known as insuring prostitutes , " said mitrovic .
" they fear they could lose business . " stuck in a rut yet many of the women themselves feel their job is indecent . theoretically , too , the prostitutes could apply for aid as founders of new businesses , but on a practical level , most do not fulfil the requirements , said mechthild pingler of the hamburg employment agency . the prostitutes ' chances of finding other employment through state-run job placement programs are also slim . " we do not , however , offer prostitution jobs to people , " pingler stressed .
" that protects the unemployed , who through the hartz iv program are otherwise are forced to take any job not deemed ' immoral . " ' pingler has been working with prostitutes for 15 years .
hardly any of the women she knows have taken part in occupational retraining programs since most of them could not easily integrate themselves into another job market . " the biggest problem is that the women have a completely different way of working than in most other jobs , " she said .
" they may have worked hard all their lives , but prostitution is still not your classic nine-to-five job .

" you have to imagine it like this : a surgeon stands in front of a real table that resembles an operating table , " said computer scientist torsten kuhlen , who is in charge of the research team developing the virtual operating room . " a video beamer is installed within the table and in conjunction with a pair of ' stereo glasses ' which the surgeon wears , a kind of holographic image of the patient is created , " kuhlen said . the patient , thus , appears as a hologram lying on the " operating table . " simulating reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants must wear goggles to see virtualities for the whole process to work , the conditions in the virtual operating room must emulate real conditions as much as possible .
it 's not enough to depict organs , bones , muscles and sinews .
for the virtual operating room to be useful as a learning tool , the whole body must be visualized , right down to the various layers of the human skin . virtual operating technology must even relay the skin 's resistance in order to create a realistic feel of using a scalpel during surgery . researchers at the computing and communication center in aachen have come up with a solution for that .
a robot holding a scalpel is placed in front of the operating table .
when the surgeon grabs hold of the scalpel and cuts through the virtual skin , the robot generates the tension created by different layers of the human skin . achieving this , however , was no easy task for kuhlen and his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virtual realities are becoming increasingly more complex " to make the situation realistic , the surgeons want the virtual operating room to correspond with real time , " kuhlen said . " we have to use and sometimes develop new , very complex mathematics to create the virtual , yet realistic skin layers .
this complex mathematical rendering has to happen very fast to correspond with real time .
that means up to 60 renderings per second - 60 images are shown per second , " he said . advanced medical technology virtual realities are often used nowadays in the medical field , particularly during training .
doctors also regularly use virtual simulations to help them plan operations . computer scientist lenka yerabkova , however , is convinced that the technology being developed in aachen by far exceeds the currently available systems . " current computers applications in the field of medicine can simulate organs and change their shape , " yerabkova said . " but realistic simulations of cutting through tissue along various lines and at various depths - just like in a classic operation - have not been possible until now , " she said . up-and-coming surgeons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real operating room is a scary place for " practicing " virtual practice could not only dramatically shorten the length of real operations , but also significantly improve the training of young doctors . " a university clinic , of course , has lots of young doctors just starting out who need to be trained , " said timm wolter of aachen 's university clinic . " on the other hand , there is a limited number of patients .

there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .
the current economic downturn in the united state will not have a significant affect on germany 's economic growth , because this will be offset by the dynamism of other markets , such as eastern europe , russia , china , india and the middle east . the strong euro also wo n't have an adverse affect .
one the one hand , the financial sector offers enough alternatives to secure against currency fluctuations and on the other hands , an expensive euro makes imports cheaper and helps with stabilizing prices . german firms are n't just achieving record turnovers , but also record profits .
the economy is robust enough to deal with the dip in private consumption expected at the beginning of next year when the 3 percent increase in sales tax is introduced . all of this means germany has an extremely positive economic outlook for 2007 . karl zawadzky is a business editor for dw-radio -lrb- kh -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .
-lrb- 14.12.2006 -rrb- germany 's economic projections bounce back optimism is high in germany after new surveys show an increase in german business confidence after a 13-year low , and forecast greater than expected gdp growth for 2007 .
-lrb- 12.12.2006 -rrb- german economic boom leads to calls for higher wages union leaders and some politicians are calling for substantial wage increases because of unexpected growth rates this year .
but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy .

" only those who have been in the business longer want that kind of job because they want a pension , " she said . she also said it is difficult to collect figures since insurance companies only loosely define the jobs of their insured into groups , and not individual types of employment .

german waste combines with chinese know-how to create clothing from old plastic . one minute you 're drinking from it , the next you could be wearing it .
thanks to recycling technology and trade agreements between germany and china , the ice cold bottle of fizzy drink that keeps you cool on a summer 's day may eventually find its way back to you as a fleece sweater to warm you up in winter . since the beginning of 1993 , all plastic bottles in germany have been sorted from the rest of the country 's garbage for recycling purposes .
four years ago , a security duty was added to the price of pet -lrb- poly-ethylen-terephthalat -rrb- bottles in a bid to encourage more people to return them to collecting points .
as a result , the amount of bottles coming back has been overwhelming .
more than 800 million pet bottles are collected every year in germany ; the majority of them collected by the big supermarket chains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of these bottles will eventually be heading to china but what does one do with all these bottles ?
luckily , some bright spark hit on the idea of shipping the pet containers to china . the bottles are picked up from the supermarkets by a collection company , which takes them to a facility where the bottles are dissembled into pet fragments and pressed into bales .
the bales are then sold to chinese traders at a tidy profit . high prices still chea per in the long run the chinese textile industry has an immense need for plastics .
even the high prices the chinese must pay for the pet bales from germany are cheaper than if the plastic was manufactured in china .
the transport duties between hamburg and hong kong are low and the manpower in china is cheap due to less rigid controls . " once in china , the pet material is melted down and made into thin thread which can be interweaved , " said sasha schuh , manager of consultation company ascon which deal specifically in waste economy .
one pullover needs the equivalent of 16 liter bottles . once the garments have been made from the pet , they are shipped back to germany where more money is made .
a fleece sweater can go for anything between 50-100 euros -lrb- $ -rrb- .
the manufacturing process costs around 32 cents . number one market for garbage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one man 's rubbish is another man 's profit china 's ever-expanding economy - a growth rate of almost 10 percent a year - makes for a country insatiable for raw materials .
such a huge country with huge demands requires much more than its resources of oil and gas can cope with . china has become a world market leader in secondary raw materials and rubbish .
what used to go straight to the dump now ends up back on the shelves as a new product thanks mostly to the chinese . this new market has also made rubbish and raw materials more valuable .
instead of stinking garbage piles and environmentally unfriendly land fill sites , the future could see more and more high-tech factories which process waste into new products .

there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .
the current economic downturn in the united state will not have a significant affect on germany 's economic growth , because this will be offset by the dynamism of other markets , such as eastern europe , russia , china , india and the middle east . the strong euro also wo n't have an adverse affect .
one the one hand , the financial sector offers enough alternatives to secure against currency fluctuations and on the other hands , an expensive euro makes imports cheaper and helps with stabilizing prices . german firms are n't just achieving record turnovers , but also record profits .
the economy is robust enough to deal with the dip in private consumption expected at the beginning of next year when the 3 percent increase in sales tax is introduced . all of this means germany has an extremely positive economic outlook for 2007 . karl zawadzky is a business editor for dw-radio -lrb- kh -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .

the german statistics office estimates that around 400,000 women work as prostitutes .
it 's a normal job in germany - at least on paper . with annual turnover estimated at 15 billion euros -lrb- nearly $ 20 billion -rrb- a year , it 's a business that can not be ignored .
european union members states vary in their policies concerning prostitution .
in sweden , prostitutes are fined when caught turning tricks .
the netherlands and germany , however , have pushed for complete legalization , with german prostitutes able to receive vacation and health benefits . the german health ministry intends to soon present its first assessment of the situation since prostitution was legalized three years ago . all the world 's a stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states vary in their prostitution laws prostitutes go about their business in different ways .
in a brothel in hamburg , some young women prance around in stilettos and lingerie in front of potential clients .
one man sits in a red velvet chair with golden armrests , admiring the women .
music videos dancing across a television screen . other prostitutes sit in a back room and wait .
they lounge around on sofas , smoking and eating chips and cookies . natascha , an 18-year-old from russia , has been turning tricks for three months . " i used to go to school , " she said .
" then i quit , did nothing for a couple of years , and after awhile , i thought ' okay , i 'll try it out . " ' " i ended up liking it and decided to stay in hamburg , " she said , taking a drag on her cigarette .
she works six days a week . chantal , who is 28 , does not have to work so much .
she 's a " part-time prostitute . "
she earns her living primarily through a normal job .
it 's enough for her and her son to live on , but she does n't want it that way . " i do n't depend on the money ; it 's just a little extra , " she said .
chantal only circuits the brothel when she has time and is in the mood . freelancers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is shutting down a third of red light businesses to crack down on crime whether they work part or full-time , none of these women are " on staff " at the brothel .
doris , the brothel madame who herself worked as a prostitute for years , said most sex workers are not interested in a contract . " the ladies are only in the business for a short time , " she said .
" here at the brothel in hamburg , they often stay just a year or two .
and they do n't want it down on paper what they do . " as a result , most of the prostitutes have not signed up for health insurance or pension plans . one exception , however , is tamara .
the 23-year-old said sex was always her hobby , so she turned it into a job .
she has registered her job as a sex worker at the local authorities . " once everything became legal , people looked at me a bit strangely , " she said . " but i 'm upfront about everything , and do not receive money from the state - no welfare , no unemployment money , and i pay for my health insurance . " tamara is also saving money for the future , which she believes is essential . gathering figures though german law made it possible three years ago to employ prostitutes as staff - with full benefits - few have taken advantage of it , said social scientist emilya mitrovic , who conducted a survey for the union group verdi . " only those who have been in the business longer want that kind of job because they want a pension , " she said . she also said it is difficult to collect figures since insurance companies only loosely define the jobs of their insured into groups , and not individual types of employment .
in other words , rather than being defined as " prostitute " or " sex worker " in insurance companies ' computer systems , the women on health schemes may simply be in " group 913 , " which also includes hotel and restaurant workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a calling , others as a curse other , private insurance companies do not wish to have their reputations tainted so they do not provide information . " insurance companies are scared of becoming known as insuring prostitutes , " said mitrovic .
" they fear they could lose business . " stuck in a rut yet many of the women themselves feel their job is indecent . theoretically , too , the prostitutes could apply for aid as founders of new businesses , but on a practical level , most do not fulfil the requirements , said mechthild pingler of the hamburg employment agency . the prostitutes ' chances of finding other employment through state-run job placement programs are also slim . " we do not , however , offer prostitution jobs to people , " pingler stressed .
" that protects the unemployed , who through the hartz iv program are otherwise are forced to take any job not deemed ' immoral . " ' pingler has been working with prostitutes for 15 years .
hardly any of the women she knows have taken part in occupational retraining programs since most of them could not easily integrate themselves into another job market . " the biggest problem is that the women have a completely different way of working than in most other jobs , " she said .
" they may have worked hard all their lives , but prostitution is still not your classic nine-to-five job .

the german statistics office estimates that around 400,000 women work as prostitutes .
it 's a normal job in germany - at least on paper . with annual turnover estimated at 15 billion euros -lrb- nearly $ 20 billion -rrb- a year , it 's a business that can not be ignored .
european union members states vary in their policies concerning prostitution .
in sweden , prostitutes are fined when caught turning tricks .
the netherlands and germany , however , have pushed for complete legalization , with german prostitutes able to receive vacation and health benefits . the german health ministry intends to soon present its first assessment of the situation since prostitution was legalized three years ago . all the world 's a stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states vary in their prostitution laws prostitutes go about their business in different ways .
in a brothel in hamburg , some young women prance around in stilettos and lingerie in front of potential clients .
one man sits in a red velvet chair with golden armrests , admiring the women .
music videos dancing across a television screen . other prostitutes sit in a back room and wait .
they lounge around on sofas , smoking and eating chips and cookies . natascha , an 18-year-old from russia , has been turning tricks for three months . " i used to go to school , " she said .
" then i quit , did nothing for a couple of years , and after awhile , i thought ' okay , i 'll try it out . " ' " i ended up liking it and decided to stay in hamburg , " she said , taking a drag on her cigarette .
she works six days a week . chantal , who is 28 , does not have to work so much .
she 's a " part-time prostitute . "
she earns her living primarily through a normal job .
it 's enough for her and her son to live on , but she does n't want it that way . " i do n't depend on the money ; it 's just a little extra , " she said .
chantal only circuits the brothel when she has time and is in the mood . freelancers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is shutting down a third of red light businesses to crack down on crime whether they work part or full-time , none of these women are " on staff " at the brothel .
doris , the brothel madame who herself worked as a prostitute for years , said most sex workers are not interested in a contract . " the ladies are only in the business for a short time , " she said .
" here at the brothel in hamburg , they often stay just a year or two .
and they do n't want it down on paper what they do . " as a result , most of the prostitutes have not signed up for health insurance or pension plans . one exception , however , is tamara .
the 23-year-old said sex was always her hobby , so she turned it into a job .
she has registered her job as a sex worker at the local authorities . " once everything became legal , people looked at me a bit strangely , " she said . " but i 'm upfront about everything , and do not receive money from the state - no welfare , no unemployment money , and i pay for my health insurance . " tamara is also saving money for the future , which she believes is essential . gathering figures though german law made it possible three years ago to employ prostitutes as staff - with full benefits - few have taken advantage of it , said social scientist emilya mitrovic , who conducted a survey for the union group verdi . " only those who have been in the business longer want that kind of job because they want a pension , " she said . she also said it is difficult to collect figures since insurance companies only loosely define the jobs of their insured into groups , and not individual types of employment .
in other words , rather than being defined as " prostitute " or " sex worker " in insurance companies ' computer systems , the women on health schemes may simply be in " group 913 , " which also includes hotel and restaurant workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a calling , others as a curse other , private insurance companies do not wish to have their reputations tainted so they do not provide information . " insurance companies are scared of becoming known as insuring prostitutes , " said mitrovic .
" they fear they could lose business . " stuck in a rut yet many of the women themselves feel their job is indecent . theoretically , too , the prostitutes could apply for aid as founders of new businesses , but on a practical level , most do not fulfil the requirements , said mechthild pingler of the hamburg employment agency . the prostitutes ' chances of finding other employment through state-run job placement programs are also slim . " we do not , however , offer prostitution jobs to people , " pingler stressed .
" that protects the unemployed , who through the hartz iv program are otherwise are forced to take any job not deemed ' immoral . " ' pingler has been working with prostitutes for 15 years .
hardly any of the women she knows have taken part in occupational retraining programs since most of them could not easily integrate themselves into another job market . " the biggest problem is that the women have a completely different way of working than in most other jobs , " she said .
" they may have worked hard all their lives , but prostitution is still not your classic nine-to-five job .

there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .

industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .

" you have to imagine it like this : a surgeon stands in front of a real table that resembles an operating table , " said computer scientist torsten kuhlen , who is in charge of the research team developing the virtual operating room . " a video beamer is installed within the table and in conjunction with a pair of ' stereo glasses ' which the surgeon wears , a kind of holographic image of the patient is created , " kuhlen said . the patient , thus , appears as a hologram lying on the " operating table . " simulating reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants must wear goggles to see virtualities for the whole process to work , the conditions in the virtual operating room must emulate real conditions as much as possible .
it 's not enough to depict organs , bones , muscles and sinews .
for the virtual operating room to be useful as a learning tool , the whole body must be visualized , right down to the various layers of the human skin . virtual operating technology must even relay the skin 's resistance in order to create a realistic feel of using a scalpel during surgery . researchers at the computing and communication center in aachen have come up with a solution for that .
a robot holding a scalpel is placed in front of the operating table .
when the surgeon grabs hold of the scalpel and cuts through the virtual skin , the robot generates the tension created by different layers of the human skin . achieving this , however , was no easy task for kuhlen and his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virtual realities are becoming increasingly more complex " to make the situation realistic , the surgeons want the virtual operating room to correspond with real time , " kuhlen said . " we have to use and sometimes develop new , very complex mathematics to create the virtual , yet realistic skin layers .
this complex mathematical rendering has to happen very fast to correspond with real time .
that means up to 60 renderings per second - 60 images are shown per second , " he said . advanced medical technology virtual realities are often used nowadays in the medical field , particularly during training .
doctors also regularly use virtual simulations to help them plan operations . computer scientist lenka yerabkova , however , is convinced that the technology being developed in aachen by far exceeds the currently available systems . " current computers applications in the field of medicine can simulate organs and change their shape , " yerabkova said . " but realistic simulations of cutting through tissue along various lines and at various depths - just like in a classic operation - have not been possible until now , " she said . up-and-coming surgeons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real operating room is a scary place for " practicing " virtual practice could not only dramatically shorten the length of real operations , but also significantly improve the training of young doctors . " a university clinic , of course , has lots of young doctors just starting out who need to be trained , " said timm wolter of aachen 's university clinic . " on the other hand , there is a limited number of patients .
and some types of operations , which are normally standard , are rarely performed in teaching hospitals , " he said . such operations , for instance , could be practiced repeatedly in virtual surgery . computer researchers in aachen are still optimizing their technology .
it will likely be another five years before the first virtual operations can be performed . ingo wagner -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing artificial intelligence on german soccer fields german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .

the german statistics office estimates that around 400,000 women work as prostitutes .
it 's a normal job in germany - at least on paper . with annual turnover estimated at 15 billion euros -lrb- nearly $ 20 billion -rrb- a year , it 's a business that can not be ignored .
european union members states vary in their policies concerning prostitution .
in sweden , prostitutes are fined when caught turning tricks .
the netherlands and germany , however , have pushed for complete legalization , with german prostitutes able to receive vacation and health benefits . the german health ministry intends to soon present its first assessment of the situation since prostitution was legalized three years ago . all the world 's a stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states vary in their prostitution laws prostitutes go about their business in different ways .
in a brothel in hamburg , some young women prance around in stilettos and lingerie in front of potential clients .
one man sits in a red velvet chair with golden armrests , admiring the women .
music videos dancing across a television screen . other prostitutes sit in a back room and wait .
they lounge around on sofas , smoking and eating chips and cookies . natascha , an 18-year-old from russia , has been turning tricks for three months . " i used to go to school , " she said .
" then i quit , did nothing for a couple of years , and after awhile , i thought ' okay , i 'll try it out . " ' " i ended up liking it and decided to stay in hamburg , " she said , taking a drag on her cigarette .
she works six days a week . chantal , who is 28 , does not have to work so much .
she 's a " part-time prostitute . "
she earns her living primarily through a normal job .
it 's enough for her and her son to live on , but she does n't want it that way . " i do n't depend on the money ; it 's just a little extra , " she said .
chantal only circuits the brothel when she has time and is in the mood . freelancers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is shutting down a third of red light businesses to crack down on crime whether they work part or full-time , none of these women are " on staff " at the brothel .
doris , the brothel madame who herself worked as a prostitute for years , said most sex workers are not interested in a contract . " the ladies are only in the business for a short time , " she said .
" here at the brothel in hamburg , they often stay just a year or two .
and they do n't want it down on paper what they do . " as a result , most of the prostitutes have not signed up for health insurance or pension plans . one exception , however , is tamara .
the 23-year-old said sex was always her hobby , so she turned it into a job .
she has registered her job as a sex worker at the local authorities . " once everything became legal , people looked at me a bit strangely , " she said . " but i 'm upfront about everything , and do not receive money from the state - no welfare , no unemployment money , and i pay for my health insurance . " tamara is also saving money for the future , which she believes is essential . gathering figures though german law made it possible three years ago to employ prostitutes as staff - with full benefits - few have taken advantage of it , said social scientist emilya mitrovic , who conducted a survey for the union group verdi . " only those who have been in the business longer want that kind of job because they want a pension , " she said . she also said it is difficult to collect figures since insurance companies only loosely define the jobs of their insured into groups , and not individual types of employment .
in other words , rather than being defined as " prostitute " or " sex worker " in insurance companies ' computer systems , the women on health schemes may simply be in " group 913 , " which also includes hotel and restaurant workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a calling , others as a curse other , private insurance companies do not wish to have their reputations tainted so they do not provide information . " insurance companies are scared of becoming known as insuring prostitutes , " said mitrovic .
" they fear they could lose business . " stuck in a rut yet many of the women themselves feel their job is indecent . theoretically , too , the prostitutes could apply for aid as founders of new businesses , but on a practical level , most do not fulfil the requirements , said mechthild pingler of the hamburg employment agency . the prostitutes ' chances of finding other employment through state-run job placement programs are also slim . " we do not , however , offer prostitution jobs to people , " pingler stressed .
" that protects the unemployed , who through the hartz iv program are otherwise are forced to take any job not deemed ' immoral . " ' pingler has been working with prostitutes for 15 years .
hardly any of the women she knows have taken part in occupational retraining programs since most of them could not easily integrate themselves into another job market . " the biggest problem is that the women have a completely different way of working than in most other jobs , " she said .
" they may have worked hard all their lives , but prostitution is still not your classic nine-to-five job .

well , you could be wearing them .
german waste combines with chinese know-how to create clothing from old plastic . one minute you 're drinking from it , the next you could be wearing it .
thanks to recycling technology and trade agreements between germany and china , the ice cold bottle of fizzy drink that keeps you cool on a summer 's day may eventually find its way back to you as a fleece sweater to warm you up in winter . since the beginning of 1993 , all plastic bottles in germany have been sorted from the rest of the country 's garbage for recycling purposes .
four years ago , a security duty was added to the price of pet -lrb- poly-ethylen-terephthalat -rrb- bottles in a bid to encourage more people to return them to collecting points .
as a result , the amount of bottles coming back has been overwhelming .
more than 800 million pet bottles are collected every year in germany ; the majority of them collected by the big supermarket chains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of these bottles will eventually be heading to china but what does one do with all these bottles ?
luckily , some bright spark hit on the idea of shipping the pet containers to china . the bottles are picked up from the supermarkets by a collection company , which takes them to a facility where the bottles are dissembled into pet fragments and pressed into bales .
the bales are then sold to chinese traders at a tidy profit . high prices still chea per in the long run the chinese textile industry has an immense need for plastics .
even the high prices the chinese must pay for the pet bales from germany are cheaper than if the plastic was manufactured in china .
the transport duties between hamburg and hong kong are low and the manpower in china is cheap due to less rigid controls . " once in china , the pet material is melted down and made into thin thread which can be interweaved , " said sasha schuh , manager of consultation company ascon which deal specifically in waste economy .
one pullover needs the equivalent of 16 liter bottles . once the garments have been made from the pet , they are shipped back to germany where more money is made .
a fleece sweater can go for anything between 50-100 euros -lrb- $ -rrb- .
the manufacturing process costs around 32 cents . number one market for garbage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one man 's rubbish is another man 's profit china 's ever-expanding economy - a growth rate of almost 10 percent a year - makes for a country insatiable for raw materials .
such a huge country with huge demands requires much more than its resources of oil and gas can cope with . china has become a world market leader in secondary raw materials and rubbish .
what used to go straight to the dump now ends up back on the shelves as a new product thanks mostly to the chinese . this new market has also made rubbish and raw materials more valuable .
instead of stinking garbage piles and environmentally unfriendly land fill sites , the future could see more and more high-tech factories which process waste into new products .
as such , waste materials like pet have become major economic factors .
and one day , throwing away trash never to see it again in some form may be a thing of the past . ana lehmann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de recycling scam pops the lid off deposit debate three german thieves devised a plan to make a massive return on a moderate investment , by turning in 150,000 plastic bottles for deposit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.12.2006 opinion : good news for germany 's economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky . for many years , germany 's economy was sluggish compared to other european union countries .
there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .
the current economic downturn in the united state will not have a significant affect on germany 's economic growth , because this will be offset by the dynamism of other markets , such as eastern europe , russia , china , india and the middle east . the strong euro also wo n't have an adverse affect .
one the one hand , the financial sector offers enough alternatives to secure against currency fluctuations and on the other hands , an expensive euro makes imports cheaper and helps with stabilizing prices . german firms are n't just achieving record turnovers , but also record profits .
the economy is robust enough to deal with the dip in private consumption expected at the beginning of next year when the 3 percent increase in sales tax is introduced . all of this means germany has an extremely positive economic outlook for 2007 . karl zawadzky is a business editor for dw-radio -lrb- kh -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .
-lrb- 14.12.2006 -rrb- germany 's economic projections bounce back optimism is high in germany after new surveys show an increase in german business confidence after a 13-year low , and forecast greater than expected gdp growth for 2007 .
-lrb- 12.12.2006 -rrb- german economic boom leads to calls for higher wages union leaders and some politicians are calling for substantial wage increases because of unexpected growth rates this year .
but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 30.12.2006 practicing without risk in a virtual operating room großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a virtual operating room could be a great learning tool thanks to the prototype of a virtual operating room developed at the university of aachen , young surgeons may one day learn surgery techniques with the help of a robot . " you have to imagine it like this : a surgeon stands in front of a real table that resembles an operating table , " said computer scientist torsten kuhlen , who is in charge of the research team developing the virtual operating room . " a video beamer is installed within the table and in conjunction with a pair of ' stereo glasses ' which the surgeon wears , a kind of holographic image of the patient is created , " kuhlen said . the patient , thus , appears as a hologram lying on the " operating table . " simulating reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants must wear goggles to see virtualities for the whole process to work , the conditions in the virtual operating room must emulate real conditions as much as possible .
it 's not enough to depict organs , bones , muscles and sinews .
for the virtual operating room to be useful as a learning tool , the whole body must be visualized , right down to the various layers of the human skin . virtual operating technology must even relay the skin 's resistance in order to create a realistic feel of using a scalpel during surgery . researchers at the computing and communication center in aachen have come up with a solution for that .
a robot holding a scalpel is placed in front of the operating table .
when the surgeon grabs hold of the scalpel and cuts through the virtual skin , the robot generates the tension created by different layers of the human skin . achieving this , however , was no easy task for kuhlen and his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virtual realities are becoming increasingly more complex " to make the situation realistic , the surgeons want the virtual operating room to correspond with real time , " kuhlen said . " we have to use and sometimes develop new , very complex mathematics to create the virtual , yet realistic skin layers .
this complex mathematical rendering has to happen very fast to correspond with real time .
that means up to 60 renderings per second - 60 images are shown per second , " he said . advanced medical technology virtual realities are often used nowadays in the medical field , particularly during training .
doctors also regularly use virtual simulations to help them plan operations . computer scientist lenka yerabkova , however , is convinced that the technology being developed in aachen by far exceeds the currently available systems . " current computers applications in the field of medicine can simulate organs and change their shape , " yerabkova said . " but realistic simulations of cutting through tissue along various lines and at various depths - just like in a classic operation - have not been possible until now , " she said . up-and-coming surgeons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real operating room is a scary place for " practicing " virtual practice could not only dramatically shorten the length of real operations , but also significantly improve the training of young doctors . " a university clinic , of course , has lots of young doctors just starting out who need to be trained , " said timm wolter of aachen 's university clinic . " on the other hand , there is a limited number of patients .
and some types of operations , which are normally standard , are rarely performed in teaching hospitals , " he said . such operations , for instance , could be practiced repeatedly in virtual surgery . computer researchers in aachen are still optimizing their technology .
it will likely be another five years before the first virtual operations can be performed . ingo wagner -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing artificial intelligence on german soccer fields german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .

the german statistics office estimates that around 400,000 women work as prostitutes .
it 's a normal job in germany - at least on paper . with annual turnover estimated at 15 billion euros -lrb- nearly $ 20 billion -rrb- a year , it 's a business that can not be ignored .
european union members states vary in their policies concerning prostitution .
in sweden , prostitutes are fined when caught turning tricks .
the netherlands and germany , however , have pushed for complete legalization , with german prostitutes able to receive vacation and health benefits . the german health ministry intends to soon present its first assessment of the situation since prostitution was legalized three years ago . all the world 's a stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states vary in their prostitution laws prostitutes go about their business in different ways .
in a brothel in hamburg , some young women prance around in stilettos and lingerie in front of potential clients .
one man sits in a red velvet chair with golden armrests , admiring the women .
music videos dancing across a television screen . other prostitutes sit in a back room and wait .
they lounge around on sofas , smoking and eating chips and cookies . natascha , an 18-year-old from russia , has been turning tricks for three months . " i used to go to school , " she said .
" then i quit , did nothing for a couple of years , and after awhile , i thought ' okay , i 'll try it out . " ' " i ended up liking it and decided to stay in hamburg , " she said , taking a drag on her cigarette .
she works six days a week . chantal , who is 28 , does not have to work so much .
she 's a " part-time prostitute . "
she earns her living primarily through a normal job .
it 's enough for her and her son to live on , but she does n't want it that way . " i do n't depend on the money ; it 's just a little extra , " she said .
chantal only circuits the brothel when she has time and is in the mood . freelancers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is shutting down a third of red light businesses to crack down on crime whether they work part or full-time , none of these women are " on staff " at the brothel .
doris , the brothel madame who herself worked as a prostitute for years , said most sex workers are not interested in a contract . " the ladies are only in the business for a short time , " she said .
" here at the brothel in hamburg , they often stay just a year or two .
and they do n't want it down on paper what they do . " as a result , most of the prostitutes have not signed up for health insurance or pension plans . one exception , however , is tamara .
the 23-year-old said sex was always her hobby , so she turned it into a job .
she has registered her job as a sex worker at the local authorities . " once everything became legal , people looked at me a bit strangely , " she said . " but i 'm upfront about everything , and do not receive money from the state - no welfare , no unemployment money , and i pay for my health insurance . " tamara is also saving money for the future , which she believes is essential . gathering figures though german law made it possible three years ago to employ prostitutes as staff - with full benefits - few have taken advantage of it , said social scientist emilya mitrovic , who conducted a survey for the union group verdi . " only those who have been in the business longer want that kind of job because they want a pension , " she said . she also said it is difficult to collect figures since insurance companies only loosely define the jobs of their insured into groups , and not individual types of employment .
in other words , rather than being defined as " prostitute " or " sex worker " in insurance companies ' computer systems , the women on health schemes may simply be in " group 913 , " which also includes hotel and restaurant workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a calling , others as a curse other , private insurance companies do not wish to have their reputations tainted so they do not provide information . " insurance companies are scared of becoming known as insuring prostitutes , " said mitrovic .
" they fear they could lose business . " stuck in a rut yet many of the women themselves feel their job is indecent . theoretically , too , the prostitutes could apply for aid as founders of new businesses , but on a practical level , most do not fulfil the requirements , said mechthild pingler of the hamburg employment agency . the prostitutes ' chances of finding other employment through state-run job placement programs are also slim . " we do not , however , offer prostitution jobs to people , " pingler stressed .
" that protects the unemployed , who through the hartz iv program are otherwise are forced to take any job not deemed ' immoral . " ' pingler has been working with prostitutes for 15 years .
hardly any of the women she knows have taken part in occupational retraining programs since most of them could not easily integrate themselves into another job market . " the biggest problem is that the women have a completely different way of working than in most other jobs , " she said .
" they may have worked hard all their lives , but prostitution is still not your classic nine-to-five job .

" you have to imagine it like this : a surgeon stands in front of a real table that resembles an operating table , " said computer scientist torsten kuhlen , who is in charge of the research team developing the virtual operating room . " a video beamer is installed within the table and in conjunction with a pair of ' stereo glasses ' which the surgeon wears , a kind of holographic image of the patient is created , " kuhlen said . the patient , thus , appears as a hologram lying on the " operating table . " simulating reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants must wear goggles to see virtualities for the whole process to work , the conditions in the virtual operating room must emulate real conditions as much as possible .
it 's not enough to depict organs , bones , muscles and sinews .
for the virtual operating room to be useful as a learning tool , the whole body must be visualized , right down to the various layers of the human skin . virtual operating technology must even relay the skin 's resistance in order to create a realistic feel of using a scalpel during surgery . researchers at the computing and communication center in aachen have come up with a solution for that .
a robot holding a scalpel is placed in front of the operating table .
when the surgeon grabs hold of the scalpel and cuts through the virtual skin , the robot generates the tension created by different layers of the human skin . achieving this , however , was no easy task for kuhlen and his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virtual realities are becoming increasingly more complex " to make the situation realistic , the surgeons want the virtual operating room to correspond with real time , " kuhlen said . " we have to use and sometimes develop new , very complex mathematics to create the virtual , yet realistic skin layers .
this complex mathematical rendering has to happen very fast to correspond with real time .
that means up to 60 renderings per second - 60 images are shown per second , " he said . advanced medical technology virtual realities are often used nowadays in the medical field , particularly during training .
doctors also regularly use virtual simulations to help them plan operations . computer scientist lenka yerabkova , however , is convinced that the technology being developed in aachen by far exceeds the currently available systems . " current computers applications in the field of medicine can simulate organs and change their shape , " yerabkova said . " but realistic simulations of cutting through tissue along various lines and at various depths - just like in a classic operation - have not been possible until now , " she said . up-and-coming surgeons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real operating room is a scary place for " practicing " virtual practice could not only dramatically shorten the length of real operations , but also significantly improve the training of young doctors . " a university clinic , of course , has lots of young doctors just starting out who need to be trained , " said timm wolter of aachen 's university clinic . " on the other hand , there is a limited number of patients .
and some types of operations , which are normally standard , are rarely performed in teaching hospitals , " he said . such operations , for instance , could be practiced repeatedly in virtual surgery . computer researchers in aachen are still optimizing their technology .
it will likely be another five years before the first virtual operations can be performed . ingo wagner -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing artificial intelligence on german soccer fields german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.12.2006 opinion : good news for germany 's economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky . for many years , germany 's economy was sluggish compared to other european union countries .
there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .

there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .
the current economic downturn in the united state will not have a significant affect on germany 's economic growth , because this will be offset by the dynamism of other markets , such as eastern europe , russia , china , india and the middle east . the strong euro also wo n't have an adverse affect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 30.12.2006 practicing without risk in a virtual operating room großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a virtual operating room could be a great learning tool thanks to the prototype of a virtual operating room developed at the university of aachen , young surgeons may one day learn surgery techniques with the help of a robot . " you have to imagine it like this : a surgeon stands in front of a real table that resembles an operating table , " said computer scientist torsten kuhlen , who is in charge of the research team developing the virtual operating room . " a video beamer is installed within the table and in conjunction with a pair of ' stereo glasses ' which the surgeon wears , a kind of holographic image of the patient is created , " kuhlen said . the patient , thus , appears as a hologram lying on the " operating table . " simulating reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants must wear goggles to see virtualities for the whole process to work , the conditions in the virtual operating room must emulate real conditions as much as possible .
it 's not enough to depict organs , bones , muscles and sinews .
for the virtual operating room to be useful as a learning tool , the whole body must be visualized , right down to the various layers of the human skin . virtual operating technology must even relay the skin 's resistance in order to create a realistic feel of using a scalpel during surgery . researchers at the computing and communication center in aachen have come up with a solution for that .
a robot holding a scalpel is placed in front of the operating table .
when the surgeon grabs hold of the scalpel and cuts through the virtual skin , the robot generates the tension created by different layers of the human skin . achieving this , however , was no easy task for kuhlen and his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virtual realities are becoming increasingly more complex " to make the situation realistic , the surgeons want the virtual operating room to correspond with real time , " kuhlen said . " we have to use and sometimes develop new , very complex mathematics to create the virtual , yet realistic skin layers .
this complex mathematical rendering has to happen very fast to correspond with real time .
that means up to 60 renderings per second - 60 images are shown per second , " he said . advanced medical technology virtual realities are often used nowadays in the medical field , particularly during training .
doctors also regularly use virtual simulations to help them plan operations . computer scientist lenka yerabkova , however , is convinced that the technology being developed in aachen by far exceeds the currently available systems . " current computers applications in the field of medicine can simulate organs and change their shape , " yerabkova said . " but realistic simulations of cutting through tissue along various lines and at various depths - just like in a classic operation - have not been possible until now , " she said . up-and-coming surgeons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real operating room is a scary place for " practicing " virtual practice could not only dramatically shorten the length of real operations , but also significantly improve the training of young doctors . " a university clinic , of course , has lots of young doctors just starting out who need to be trained , " said timm wolter of aachen 's university clinic . " on the other hand , there is a limited number of patients .
and some types of operations , which are normally standard , are rarely performed in teaching hospitals , " he said . such operations , for instance , could be practiced repeatedly in virtual surgery . computer researchers in aachen are still optimizing their technology .
it will likely be another five years before the first virtual operations can be performed . ingo wagner -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing artificial intelligence on german soccer fields german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .

well , you could be wearing them .
german waste combines with chinese know-how to create clothing from old plastic . one minute you 're drinking from it , the next you could be wearing it .
thanks to recycling technology and trade agreements between germany and china , the ice cold bottle of fizzy drink that keeps you cool on a summer 's day may eventually find its way back to you as a fleece sweater to warm you up in winter . since the beginning of 1993 , all plastic bottles in germany have been sorted from the rest of the country 's garbage for recycling purposes .
four years ago , a security duty was added to the price of pet -lrb- poly-ethylen-terephthalat -rrb- bottles in a bid to encourage more people to return them to collecting points .
as a result , the amount of bottles coming back has been overwhelming .
more than 800 million pet bottles are collected every year in germany ; the majority of them collected by the big supermarket chains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of these bottles will eventually be heading to china but what does one do with all these bottles ?
luckily , some bright spark hit on the idea of shipping the pet containers to china . the bottles are picked up from the supermarkets by a collection company , which takes them to a facility where the bottles are dissembled into pet fragments and pressed into bales .
the bales are then sold to chinese traders at a tidy profit . high prices still chea per in the long run the chinese textile industry has an immense need for plastics .
even the high prices the chinese must pay for the pet bales from germany are cheaper than if the plastic was manufactured in china .
the transport duties between hamburg and hong kong are low and the manpower in china is cheap due to less rigid controls . " once in china , the pet material is melted down and made into thin thread which can be interweaved , " said sasha schuh , manager of consultation company ascon which deal specifically in waste economy .
one pullover needs the equivalent of 16 liter bottles . once the garments have been made from the pet , they are shipped back to germany where more money is made .
a fleece sweater can go for anything between 50-100 euros -lrb- $ -rrb- .
the manufacturing process costs around 32 cents . number one market for garbage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one man 's rubbish is another man 's profit china 's ever-expanding economy - a growth rate of almost 10 percent a year - makes for a country insatiable for raw materials .
such a huge country with huge demands requires much more than its resources of oil and gas can cope with . china has become a world market leader in secondary raw materials and rubbish .
what used to go straight to the dump now ends up back on the shelves as a new product thanks mostly to the chinese . this new market has also made rubbish and raw materials more valuable .
instead of stinking garbage piles and environmentally unfriendly land fill sites , the future could see more and more high-tech factories which process waste into new products .
as such , waste materials like pet have become major economic factors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.12.2006 opinion : good news for germany 's economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky . for many years , germany 's economy was sluggish compared to other european union countries .
there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .
the current economic downturn in the united state will not have a significant affect on germany 's economic growth , because this will be offset by the dynamism of other markets , such as eastern europe , russia , china , india and the middle east . the strong euro also wo n't have an adverse affect .
one the one hand , the financial sector offers enough alternatives to secure against currency fluctuations and on the other hands , an expensive euro makes imports cheaper and helps with stabilizing prices . german firms are n't just achieving record turnovers , but also record profits .
the economy is robust enough to deal with the dip in private consumption expected at the beginning of next year when the 3 percent increase in sales tax is introduced . all of this means germany has an extremely positive economic outlook for 2007 . karl zawadzky is a business editor for dw-radio -lrb- kh -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .
-lrb- 14.12.2006 -rrb- germany 's economic projections bounce back optimism is high in germany after new surveys show an increase in german business confidence after a 13-year low , and forecast greater than expected gdp growth for 2007 .
-lrb- 12.12.2006 -rrb- german economic boom leads to calls for higher wages union leaders and some politicians are calling for substantial wage increases because of unexpected growth rates this year .
but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy .

there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .
the current economic downturn in the united state will not have a significant affect on germany 's economic growth , because this will be offset by the dynamism of other markets , such as eastern europe , russia , china , india and the middle east . the strong euro also wo n't have an adverse affect .
one the one hand , the financial sector offers enough alternatives to secure against currency fluctuations and on the other hands , an expensive euro makes imports cheaper and helps with stabilizing prices . german firms are n't just achieving record turnovers , but also record profits .
the economy is robust enough to deal with the dip in private consumption expected at the beginning of next year when the 3 percent increase in sales tax is introduced . all of this means germany has an extremely positive economic outlook for 2007 . karl zawadzky is a business editor for dw-radio -lrb- kh -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .

there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .
the current economic downturn in the united state will not have a significant affect on germany 's economic growth , because this will be offset by the dynamism of other markets , such as eastern europe , russia , china , india and the middle east . the strong euro also wo n't have an adverse affect .
one the one hand , the financial sector offers enough alternatives to secure against currency fluctuations and on the other hands , an expensive euro makes imports cheaper and helps with stabilizing prices . german firms are n't just achieving record turnovers , but also record profits .
the economy is robust enough to deal with the dip in private consumption expected at the beginning of next year when the 3 percent increase in sales tax is introduced . all of this means germany has an extremely positive economic outlook for 2007 . karl zawadzky is a business editor for dw-radio -lrb- kh -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .
-lrb- 14.12.2006 -rrb- germany 's economic projections bounce back optimism is high in germany after new surveys show an increase in german business confidence after a 13-year low , and forecast greater than expected gdp growth for 2007 .
-lrb- 12.12.2006 -rrb- german economic boom leads to calls for higher wages union leaders and some politicians are calling for substantial wage increases because of unexpected growth rates this year .
but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy .

" only those who have been in the business longer want that kind of job because they want a pension , " she said . she also said it is difficult to collect figures since insurance companies only loosely define the jobs of their insured into groups , and not individual types of employment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.12.2006 opinion : good news for germany 's economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky . for many years , germany 's economy was sluggish compared to other european union countries .
there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .
the current economic downturn in the united state will not have a significant affect on germany 's economic growth , because this will be offset by the dynamism of other markets , such as eastern europe , russia , china , india and the middle east . the strong euro also wo n't have an adverse affect .
one the one hand , the financial sector offers enough alternatives to secure against currency fluctuations and on the other hands , an expensive euro makes imports cheaper and helps with stabilizing prices . german firms are n't just achieving record turnovers , but also record profits .
the economy is robust enough to deal with the dip in private consumption expected at the beginning of next year when the 3 percent increase in sales tax is introduced . all of this means germany has an extremely positive economic outlook for 2007 . karl zawadzky is a business editor for dw-radio -lrb- kh -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .
-lrb- 14.12.2006 -rrb- germany 's economic projections bounce back optimism is high in germany after new surveys show an increase in german business confidence after a 13-year low , and forecast greater than expected gdp growth for 2007 .
-lrb- 12.12.2006 -rrb- german economic boom leads to calls for higher wages union leaders and some politicians are calling for substantial wage increases because of unexpected growth rates this year .
but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy .

there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .
the current economic downturn in the united state will not have a significant affect on germany 's economic growth , because this will be offset by the dynamism of other markets , such as eastern europe , russia , china , india and the middle east . the strong euro also wo n't have an adverse affect .
one the one hand , the financial sector offers enough alternatives to secure against currency fluctuations and on the other hands , an expensive euro makes imports cheaper and helps with stabilizing prices . german firms are n't just achieving record turnovers , but also record profits .
the economy is robust enough to deal with the dip in private consumption expected at the beginning of next year when the 3 percent increase in sales tax is introduced . all of this means germany has an extremely positive economic outlook for 2007 . karl zawadzky is a business editor for dw-radio -lrb- kh -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .
-lrb- 14.12.2006 -rrb- germany 's economic projections bounce back optimism is high in germany after new surveys show an increase in german business confidence after a 13-year low , and forecast greater than expected gdp growth for 2007 .
-lrb- 12.12.2006 -rrb- german economic boom leads to calls for higher wages union leaders and some politicians are calling for substantial wage increases because of unexpected growth rates this year .
but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy .

" you have to imagine it like this : a surgeon stands in front of a real table that resembles an operating table , " said computer scientist torsten kuhlen , who is in charge of the research team developing the virtual operating room . " a video beamer is installed within the table and in conjunction with a pair of ' stereo glasses ' which the surgeon wears , a kind of holographic image of the patient is created , " kuhlen said . the patient , thus , appears as a hologram lying on the " operating table . " simulating reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants must wear goggles to see virtualities for the whole process to work , the conditions in the virtual operating room must emulate real conditions as much as possible .
it 's not enough to depict organs , bones , muscles and sinews .
for the virtual operating room to be useful as a learning tool , the whole body must be visualized , right down to the various layers of the human skin . virtual operating technology must even relay the skin 's resistance in order to create a realistic feel of using a scalpel during surgery . researchers at the computing and communication center in aachen have come up with a solution for that .
a robot holding a scalpel is placed in front of the operating table .
when the surgeon grabs hold of the scalpel and cuts through the virtual skin , the robot generates the tension created by different layers of the human skin . achieving this , however , was no easy task for kuhlen and his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virtual realities are becoming increasingly more complex " to make the situation realistic , the surgeons want the virtual operating room to correspond with real time , " kuhlen said . " we have to use and sometimes develop new , very complex mathematics to create the virtual , yet realistic skin layers .
this complex mathematical rendering has to happen very fast to correspond with real time .
that means up to 60 renderings per second - 60 images are shown per second , " he said . advanced medical technology virtual realities are often used nowadays in the medical field , particularly during training .
doctors also regularly use virtual simulations to help them plan operations . computer scientist lenka yerabkova , however , is convinced that the technology being developed in aachen by far exceeds the currently available systems . " current computers applications in the field of medicine can simulate organs and change their shape , " yerabkova said . " but realistic simulations of cutting through tissue along various lines and at various depths - just like in a classic operation - have not been possible until now , " she said . up-and-coming surgeons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real operating room is a scary place for " practicing " virtual practice could not only dramatically shorten the length of real operations , but also significantly improve the training of young doctors . " a university clinic , of course , has lots of young doctors just starting out who need to be trained , " said timm wolter of aachen 's university clinic . " on the other hand , there is a limited number of patients .
and some types of operations , which are normally standard , are rarely performed in teaching hospitals , " he said . such operations , for instance , could be practiced repeatedly in virtual surgery . computer researchers in aachen are still optimizing their technology .
it will likely be another five years before the first virtual operations can be performed . ingo wagner -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing artificial intelligence on german soccer fields german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .

if smoking helped you to relax in the past , and you want to quit smoking , find another way to relax and practice that regularly . unrealistic expectations but making resolutions is a tricky business .

the german statistics office estimates that around 400,000 women work as prostitutes .
it 's a normal job in germany - at least on paper . with annual turnover estimated at 15 billion euros -lrb- nearly $ 20 billion -rrb- a year , it 's a business that can not be ignored .
european union members states vary in their policies concerning prostitution .
in sweden , prostitutes are fined when caught turning tricks .
the netherlands and germany , however , have pushed for complete legalization , with german prostitutes able to receive vacation and health benefits . the german health ministry intends to soon present its first assessment of the situation since prostitution was legalized three years ago . all the world 's a stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states vary in their prostitution laws prostitutes go about their business in different ways .
in a brothel in hamburg , some young women prance around in stilettos and lingerie in front of potential clients .
one man sits in a red velvet chair with golden armrests , admiring the women .
music videos dancing across a television screen . other prostitutes sit in a back room and wait .
they lounge around on sofas , smoking and eating chips and cookies . natascha , an 18-year-old from russia , has been turning tricks for three months . " i used to go to school , " she said .
" then i quit , did nothing for a couple of years , and after awhile , i thought ' okay , i 'll try it out . " ' " i ended up liking it and decided to stay in hamburg , " she said , taking a drag on her cigarette .
she works six days a week . chantal , who is 28 , does not have to work so much .
she 's a " part-time prostitute . "
she earns her living primarily through a normal job .
it 's enough for her and her son to live on , but she does n't want it that way . " i do n't depend on the money ; it 's just a little extra , " she said .
chantal only circuits the brothel when she has time and is in the mood . freelancers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is shutting down a third of red light businesses to crack down on crime whether they work part or full-time , none of these women are " on staff " at the brothel .
doris , the brothel madame who herself worked as a prostitute for years , said most sex workers are not interested in a contract . " the ladies are only in the business for a short time , " she said .
" here at the brothel in hamburg , they often stay just a year or two .
and they do n't want it down on paper what they do . " as a result , most of the prostitutes have not signed up for health insurance or pension plans . one exception , however , is tamara .
the 23-year-old said sex was always her hobby , so she turned it into a job .
she has registered her job as a sex worker at the local authorities . " once everything became legal , people looked at me a bit strangely , " she said . " but i 'm upfront about everything , and do not receive money from the state - no welfare , no unemployment money , and i pay for my health insurance . " tamara is also saving money for the future , which she believes is essential . gathering figures though german law made it possible three years ago to employ prostitutes as staff - with full benefits - few have taken advantage of it , said social scientist emilya mitrovic , who conducted a survey for the union group verdi . " only those who have been in the business longer want that kind of job because they want a pension , " she said . she also said it is difficult to collect figures since insurance companies only loosely define the jobs of their insured into groups , and not individual types of employment .
in other words , rather than being defined as " prostitute " or " sex worker " in insurance companies ' computer systems , the women on health schemes may simply be in " group 913 , " which also includes hotel and restaurant workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a calling , others as a curse other , private insurance companies do not wish to have their reputations tainted so they do not provide information . " insurance companies are scared of becoming known as insuring prostitutes , " said mitrovic .
" they fear they could lose business . " stuck in a rut yet many of the women themselves feel their job is indecent . theoretically , too , the prostitutes could apply for aid as founders of new businesses , but on a practical level , most do not fulfil the requirements , said mechthild pingler of the hamburg employment agency . the prostitutes ' chances of finding other employment through state-run job placement programs are also slim . " we do not , however , offer prostitution jobs to people , " pingler stressed .
" that protects the unemployed , who through the hartz iv program are otherwise are forced to take any job not deemed ' immoral . " ' pingler has been working with prostitutes for 15 years .
hardly any of the women she knows have taken part in occupational retraining programs since most of them could not easily integrate themselves into another job market . " the biggest problem is that the women have a completely different way of working than in most other jobs , " she said .
" they may have worked hard all their lives , but prostitution is still not your classic nine-to-five job .

the german statistics office estimates that around 400,000 women work as prostitutes .
it 's a normal job in germany - at least on paper . with annual turnover estimated at 15 billion euros -lrb- nearly $ 20 billion -rrb- a year , it 's a business that can not be ignored .
european union members states vary in their policies concerning prostitution .
in sweden , prostitutes are fined when caught turning tricks .
the netherlands and germany , however , have pushed for complete legalization , with german prostitutes able to receive vacation and health benefits . the german health ministry intends to soon present its first assessment of the situation since prostitution was legalized three years ago . all the world 's a stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states vary in their prostitution laws prostitutes go about their business in different ways .
in a brothel in hamburg , some young women prance around in stilettos and lingerie in front of potential clients .
one man sits in a red velvet chair with golden armrests , admiring the women .
music videos dancing across a television screen . other prostitutes sit in a back room and wait .
they lounge around on sofas , smoking and eating chips and cookies . natascha , an 18-year-old from russia , has been turning tricks for three months . " i used to go to school , " she said .
" then i quit , did nothing for a couple of years , and after awhile , i thought ' okay , i 'll try it out . " ' " i ended up liking it and decided to stay in hamburg , " she said , taking a drag on her cigarette .
she works six days a week . chantal , who is 28 , does not have to work so much .
she 's a " part-time prostitute . "
she earns her living primarily through a normal job .
it 's enough for her and her son to live on , but she does n't want it that way . " i do n't depend on the money ; it 's just a little extra , " she said .
chantal only circuits the brothel when she has time and is in the mood . freelancers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is shutting down a third of red light businesses to crack down on crime whether they work part or full-time , none of these women are " on staff " at the brothel .
doris , the brothel madame who herself worked as a prostitute for years , said most sex workers are not interested in a contract . " the ladies are only in the business for a short time , " she said .
" here at the brothel in hamburg , they often stay just a year or two .
and they do n't want it down on paper what they do . " as a result , most of the prostitutes have not signed up for health insurance or pension plans . one exception , however , is tamara .
the 23-year-old said sex was always her hobby , so she turned it into a job .
she has registered her job as a sex worker at the local authorities . " once everything became legal , people looked at me a bit strangely , " she said . " but i 'm upfront about everything , and do not receive money from the state - no welfare , no unemployment money , and i pay for my health insurance . " tamara is also saving money for the future , which she believes is essential . gathering figures though german law made it possible three years ago to employ prostitutes as staff - with full benefits - few have taken advantage of it , said social scientist emilya mitrovic , who conducted a survey for the union group verdi . " only those who have been in the business longer want that kind of job because they want a pension , " she said . she also said it is difficult to collect figures since insurance companies only loosely define the jobs of their insured into groups , and not individual types of employment .
in other words , rather than being defined as " prostitute " or " sex worker " in insurance companies ' computer systems , the women on health schemes may simply be in " group 913 , " which also includes hotel and restaurant workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a calling , others as a curse other , private insurance companies do not wish to have their reputations tainted so they do not provide information . " insurance companies are scared of becoming known as insuring prostitutes , " said mitrovic .
" they fear they could lose business . " stuck in a rut yet many of the women themselves feel their job is indecent . theoretically , too , the prostitutes could apply for aid as founders of new businesses , but on a practical level , most do not fulfil the requirements , said mechthild pingler of the hamburg employment agency . the prostitutes ' chances of finding other employment through state-run job placement programs are also slim . " we do not , however , offer prostitution jobs to people , " pingler stressed .
" that protects the unemployed , who through the hartz iv program are otherwise are forced to take any job not deemed ' immoral . " ' pingler has been working with prostitutes for 15 years .
hardly any of the women she knows have taken part in occupational retraining programs since most of them could not easily integrate themselves into another job market . " the biggest problem is that the women have a completely different way of working than in most other jobs , " she said .
" they may have worked hard all their lives , but prostitution is still not your classic nine-to-five job .

" you have to imagine it like this : a surgeon stands in front of a real table that resembles an operating table , " said computer scientist torsten kuhlen , who is in charge of the research team developing the virtual operating room . " a video beamer is installed within the table and in conjunction with a pair of ' stereo glasses ' which the surgeon wears , a kind of holographic image of the patient is created , " kuhlen said . the patient , thus , appears as a hologram lying on the " operating table . " simulating reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants must wear goggles to see virtualities for the whole process to work , the conditions in the virtual operating room must emulate real conditions as much as possible .
it 's not enough to depict organs , bones , muscles and sinews .
for the virtual operating room to be useful as a learning tool , the whole body must be visualized , right down to the various layers of the human skin . virtual operating technology must even relay the skin 's resistance in order to create a realistic feel of using a scalpel during surgery . researchers at the computing and communication center in aachen have come up with a solution for that .
a robot holding a scalpel is placed in front of the operating table .
when the surgeon grabs hold of the scalpel and cuts through the virtual skin , the robot generates the tension created by different layers of the human skin . achieving this , however , was no easy task for kuhlen and his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virtual realities are becoming increasingly more complex " to make the situation realistic , the surgeons want the virtual operating room to correspond with real time , " kuhlen said . " we have to use and sometimes develop new , very complex mathematics to create the virtual , yet realistic skin layers .
this complex mathematical rendering has to happen very fast to correspond with real time .
that means up to 60 renderings per second - 60 images are shown per second , " he said . advanced medical technology virtual realities are often used nowadays in the medical field , particularly during training .
doctors also regularly use virtual simulations to help them plan operations . computer scientist lenka yerabkova , however , is convinced that the technology being developed in aachen by far exceeds the currently available systems . " current computers applications in the field of medicine can simulate organs and change their shape , " yerabkova said . " but realistic simulations of cutting through tissue along various lines and at various depths - just like in a classic operation - have not been possible until now , " she said . up-and-coming surgeons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real operating room is a scary place for " practicing " virtual practice could not only dramatically shorten the length of real operations , but also significantly improve the training of young doctors . " a university clinic , of course , has lots of young doctors just starting out who need to be trained , " said timm wolter of aachen 's university clinic . " on the other hand , there is a limited number of patients .
and some types of operations , which are normally standard , are rarely performed in teaching hospitals , " he said . such operations , for instance , could be practiced repeatedly in virtual surgery . computer researchers in aachen are still optimizing their technology .
it will likely be another five years before the first virtual operations can be performed . ingo wagner -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing artificial intelligence on german soccer fields german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .

champagne bottles pop and couples kiss when the clock strikes midnight .
the dawn of a new year offers people the promise of positive change . we all do it .
when a new year draws near , we vow we 're going to lose weight , stop smoking , drink less , exercise more , be nicer to other people , look for a new job , do good deeds , call our mothers more often , say " i love you " to those who matter . robert tyminski , a san francisco-based psychologist , said all those new year 's resolutions have to do with seasonal changes and their effects on our psyches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new year 's fireworks " we 've entered a period characterized by less daylight and more darkness , and this change serves to remind us that life is a cycle with beginnings and endings , " he said .

the german statistics office estimates that around 400,000 women work as prostitutes .
it 's a normal job in germany - at least on paper . with annual turnover estimated at 15 billion euros -lrb- nearly $ 20 billion -rrb- a year , it 's a business that can not be ignored .
european union members states vary in their policies concerning prostitution .
in sweden , prostitutes are fined when caught turning tricks .
the netherlands and germany , however , have pushed for complete legalization , with german prostitutes able to receive vacation and health benefits . the german health ministry intends to soon present its first assessment of the situation since prostitution was legalized three years ago . all the world 's a stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states vary in their prostitution laws prostitutes go about their business in different ways .
in a brothel in hamburg , some young women prance around in stilettos and lingerie in front of potential clients .
one man sits in a red velvet chair with golden armrests , admiring the women .
music videos dancing across a television screen . other prostitutes sit in a back room and wait .
they lounge around on sofas , smoking and eating chips and cookies . natascha , an 18-year-old from russia , has been turning tricks for three months . " i used to go to school , " she said .
" then i quit , did nothing for a couple of years , and after awhile , i thought ' okay , i 'll try it out . " ' " i ended up liking it and decided to stay in hamburg , " she said , taking a drag on her cigarette .
she works six days a week . chantal , who is 28 , does not have to work so much .
she 's a " part-time prostitute . "
she earns her living primarily through a normal job .
it 's enough for her and her son to live on , but she does n't want it that way . " i do n't depend on the money ; it 's just a little extra , " she said .
chantal only circuits the brothel when she has time and is in the mood . freelancers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is shutting down a third of red light businesses to crack down on crime whether they work part or full-time , none of these women are " on staff " at the brothel .
doris , the brothel madame who herself worked as a prostitute for years , said most sex workers are not interested in a contract . " the ladies are only in the business for a short time , " she said .
" here at the brothel in hamburg , they often stay just a year or two .
and they do n't want it down on paper what they do . " as a result , most of the prostitutes have not signed up for health insurance or pension plans . one exception , however , is tamara .
the 23-year-old said sex was always her hobby , so she turned it into a job .
she has registered her job as a sex worker at the local authorities . " once everything became legal , people looked at me a bit strangely , " she said . " but i 'm upfront about everything , and do not receive money from the state - no welfare , no unemployment money , and i pay for my health insurance . " tamara is also saving money for the future , which she believes is essential . gathering figures though german law made it possible three years ago to employ prostitutes as staff - with full benefits - few have taken advantage of it , said social scientist emilya mitrovic , who conducted a survey for the union group verdi . " only those who have been in the business longer want that kind of job because they want a pension , " she said . she also said it is difficult to collect figures since insurance companies only loosely define the jobs of their insured into groups , and not individual types of employment .
in other words , rather than being defined as " prostitute " or " sex worker " in insurance companies ' computer systems , the women on health schemes may simply be in " group 913 , " which also includes hotel and restaurant workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a calling , others as a curse other , private insurance companies do not wish to have their reputations tainted so they do not provide information . " insurance companies are scared of becoming known as insuring prostitutes , " said mitrovic .
" they fear they could lose business . " stuck in a rut yet many of the women themselves feel their job is indecent . theoretically , too , the prostitutes could apply for aid as founders of new businesses , but on a practical level , most do not fulfil the requirements , said mechthild pingler of the hamburg employment agency . the prostitutes ' chances of finding other employment through state-run job placement programs are also slim . " we do not , however , offer prostitution jobs to people , " pingler stressed .
" that protects the unemployed , who through the hartz iv program are otherwise are forced to take any job not deemed ' immoral . " ' pingler has been working with prostitutes for 15 years .
hardly any of the women she knows have taken part in occupational retraining programs since most of them could not easily integrate themselves into another job market . " the biggest problem is that the women have a completely different way of working than in most other jobs , " she said .
" they may have worked hard all their lives , but prostitution is still not your classic nine-to-five job .

there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .
the current economic downturn in the united state will not have a significant affect on germany 's economic growth , because this will be offset by the dynamism of other markets , such as eastern europe , russia , china , india and the middle east . the strong euro also wo n't have an adverse affect .
one the one hand , the financial sector offers enough alternatives to secure against currency fluctuations and on the other hands , an expensive euro makes imports cheaper and helps with stabilizing prices . german firms are n't just achieving record turnovers , but also record profits .
the economy is robust enough to deal with the dip in private consumption expected at the beginning of next year when the 3 percent increase in sales tax is introduced . all of this means germany has an extremely positive economic outlook for 2007 . karl zawadzky is a business editor for dw-radio -lrb- kh -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .

there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de psychology -pipe- 30.12.2006 new year 's resolutions remain tricky business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new year 's resolutions do n't survive the first glass of champagne many people ring in the new year with fireworks and friends .
champagne bottles pop and couples kiss when the clock strikes midnight .
the dawn of a new year offers people the promise of positive change . we all do it .
when a new year draws near , we vow we 're going to lose weight , stop smoking , drink less , exercise more , be nicer to other people , look for a new job , do good deeds , call our mothers more often , say " i love you " to those who matter . robert tyminski , a san francisco-based psychologist , said all those new year 's resolutions have to do with seasonal changes and their effects on our psyches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new year 's fireworks " we 've entered a period characterized by less daylight and more darkness , and this change serves to remind us that life is a cycle with beginnings and endings , " he said . " the new year often makes us believe we can put the troubling aspects of our lives behind us and begin anew . " resolution tips the internet is full of sites that offer advice on keeping those resolutions .
most of them tell people to keep their feet firmly on the ground when making the goals .
winning the lottery , says ehow.com , is " out of your grasp . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many resolve at new year 's to lose weight instead of shooting for the near unattainable or resolving to change a major behavior pattern overnight , come up with a strategy that stays specific .
instead of resolving to " not be lazy , " something like " i want to exercise more " has a better chance of success . even better : name three days a week on which you will exercise for one hour , the site recommends . another positive " ehow " tip : " find alternatives to a behavior you want to change and make it part of your resolution plan . "
if smoking helped you to relax in the past , and you want to quit smoking , find another way to relax and practice that regularly . unrealistic expectations but making resolutions is a tricky business .
for all the promise of a new beginning with the new year , many psychologists say that setting goals too high is the surest way to fall short . " when resolutions are out of proportion to what is realistic for our circumstances , they can set someone up for a fall , " said tyminski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resolutions are personal goals to keep us on track - or intact he generally gets a flood of calls around late january and early february from people seeking help because they have been let down by resolutions made but not kept . the blues can even set in on new year 's eve since it 's a time people tend to take stock of the year just passed - at least before the champagne really starts to flow .
many people looking back realize that despite the best intentions , those resolutions fell by the wayside . " empirical studies show that new year 's resolutions generally do not stick , " jörg fengler , a psychology professor at the university of cologne , told the dpa news agency .
" most of time , we shamelessly abandon them after just a few days . " idiosyncrasies cultural differences could play a role as to how people go about resolutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then there 's always the crystal ball and tarot looking at popular new year 's resolutions listed on the us government 's portal firstgov.gov , you can glean how major problems affecting american society - obesity and debt - detemine how some people define good intentions for the new year .
the top resolutions posted : to " lose weight , pay off debt and save money . " tyminski 's own grandparents were immigrants from europe , and often encouraged a focus on improving the family 's material status . " i think prosperity may be a central point of resolutions for those in the us , " he said .
" i remember when i lived in germany that i was struck by how understated the resolutions were there . " pointing the way - with lead while resolution-making in germany might not have the sheer amplitude it does in the us , germans do like to think about the future , and many go about trying to divine it .
they do this by " pouring lead , " or bleigiessen .
it 's somewhat similar to reading tea leaves , or maybe studying animal entrails , like the ancient romans enjoyed , but considerably less messy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pouring lead " is an old custom after a festive dinner , people sit in a circle and alternately melt chunks of lead -lrb- or sometimes wax -rrb- on a spoon as they hold it over a lit candle . the molten lead is then poured from the spoon into a bucket of cold water , where it hardens immediately . the shape of the hardened lead is then interpreted by the group , and is said to reflect what the future has in store for the one who poured the lead .
an egg shape could imply an addition to the family ; a tree could mean growth in one 's capabilities ; an angel could mean goodwill .
with this tradition , if the thing promised does not come true , at least there 's something else to pin the blame on besides your own lack of discipline or personal shortcoming - it 's the lead 's fault . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness is danish life appreciation research seeks to answer one of our most daunting questions : what is the key to happiness ?

" you have to imagine it like this : a surgeon stands in front of a real table that resembles an operating table , " said computer scientist torsten kuhlen , who is in charge of the research team developing the virtual operating room . " a video beamer is installed within the table and in conjunction with a pair of ' stereo glasses ' which the surgeon wears , a kind of holographic image of the patient is created , " kuhlen said . the patient , thus , appears as a hologram lying on the " operating table . " simulating reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants must wear goggles to see virtualities for the whole process to work , the conditions in the virtual operating room must emulate real conditions as much as possible .
it 's not enough to depict organs , bones , muscles and sinews .
for the virtual operating room to be useful as a learning tool , the whole body must be visualized , right down to the various layers of the human skin . virtual operating technology must even relay the skin 's resistance in order to create a realistic feel of using a scalpel during surgery . researchers at the computing and communication center in aachen have come up with a solution for that .
a robot holding a scalpel is placed in front of the operating table .
when the surgeon grabs hold of the scalpel and cuts through the virtual skin , the robot generates the tension created by different layers of the human skin . achieving this , however , was no easy task for kuhlen and his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virtual realities are becoming increasingly more complex " to make the situation realistic , the surgeons want the virtual operating room to correspond with real time , " kuhlen said . " we have to use and sometimes develop new , very complex mathematics to create the virtual , yet realistic skin layers .
this complex mathematical rendering has to happen very fast to correspond with real time .
that means up to 60 renderings per second - 60 images are shown per second , " he said . advanced medical technology virtual realities are often used nowadays in the medical field , particularly during training .
doctors also regularly use virtual simulations to help them plan operations . computer scientist lenka yerabkova , however , is convinced that the technology being developed in aachen by far exceeds the currently available systems . " current computers applications in the field of medicine can simulate organs and change their shape , " yerabkova said . " but realistic simulations of cutting through tissue along various lines and at various depths - just like in a classic operation - have not been possible until now , " she said . up-and-coming surgeons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real operating room is a scary place for " practicing " virtual practice could not only dramatically shorten the length of real operations , but also significantly improve the training of young doctors . " a university clinic , of course , has lots of young doctors just starting out who need to be trained , " said timm wolter of aachen 's university clinic . " on the other hand , there is a limited number of patients .
and some types of operations , which are normally standard , are rarely performed in teaching hospitals , " he said . such operations , for instance , could be practiced repeatedly in virtual surgery . computer researchers in aachen are still optimizing their technology .
it will likely be another five years before the first virtual operations can be performed . ingo wagner -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing artificial intelligence on german soccer fields german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .

well , you could be wearing them .
german waste combines with chinese know-how to create clothing from old plastic . one minute you 're drinking from it , the next you could be wearing it .
thanks to recycling technology and trade agreements between germany and china , the ice cold bottle of fizzy drink that keeps you cool on a summer 's day may eventually find its way back to you as a fleece sweater to warm you up in winter . since the beginning of 1993 , all plastic bottles in germany have been sorted from the rest of the country 's garbage for recycling purposes .
four years ago , a security duty was added to the price of pet -lrb- poly-ethylen-terephthalat -rrb- bottles in a bid to encourage more people to return them to collecting points .
as a result , the amount of bottles coming back has been overwhelming .
more than 800 million pet bottles are collected every year in germany ; the majority of them collected by the big supermarket chains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of these bottles will eventually be heading to china but what does one do with all these bottles ?
luckily , some bright spark hit on the idea of shipping the pet containers to china . the bottles are picked up from the supermarkets by a collection company , which takes them to a facility where the bottles are dissembled into pet fragments and pressed into bales .
the bales are then sold to chinese traders at a tidy profit . high prices still chea per in the long run the chinese textile industry has an immense need for plastics .
even the high prices the chinese must pay for the pet bales from germany are cheaper than if the plastic was manufactured in china .
the transport duties between hamburg and hong kong are low and the manpower in china is cheap due to less rigid controls . " once in china , the pet material is melted down and made into thin thread which can be interweaved , " said sasha schuh , manager of consultation company ascon which deal specifically in waste economy .
one pullover needs the equivalent of 16 liter bottles . once the garments have been made from the pet , they are shipped back to germany where more money is made .
a fleece sweater can go for anything between 50-100 euros -lrb- $ -rrb- .
the manufacturing process costs around 32 cents . number one market for garbage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one man 's rubbish is another man 's profit china 's ever-expanding economy - a growth rate of almost 10 percent a year - makes for a country insatiable for raw materials .
such a huge country with huge demands requires much more than its resources of oil and gas can cope with . china has become a world market leader in secondary raw materials and rubbish .
what used to go straight to the dump now ends up back on the shelves as a new product thanks mostly to the chinese . this new market has also made rubbish and raw materials more valuable .
instead of stinking garbage piles and environmentally unfriendly land fill sites , the future could see more and more high-tech factories which process waste into new products .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.12.2006 opinion : good news for germany 's economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky . for many years , germany 's economy was sluggish compared to other european union countries .
there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .

there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .
the current economic downturn in the united state will not have a significant affect on germany 's economic growth , because this will be offset by the dynamism of other markets , such as eastern europe , russia , china , india and the middle east . the strong euro also wo n't have an adverse affect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.12.2006 opinion : a missed historic chance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp says that the execution of saddam hussein makes it impossible to continue with the process of dealing with and coming to terms with his reign of terror in iraq . it would be misplaced to feel sympathy for a man who himself did n't know the meaning of the word and who spent a part of his life brutally crushing those who stood in his way and who was responsible for the suffering and death of thousands of people .
the execution of saddam hussein in the early hours of the muslim sacrificial festival id el adha must have come as a release for former victims of his nearly 30-year reign of terror who did n't find peace even after the ousting of saddam .
the hanging will also likely end any remaining illusions and hopes that saddam 's supporters may have had that history could be rewritten and that lost power could be restored . it seems that the swift execution of saddam 's death sentence was meant primarily to serve these two groups .
the new iraqi leadership considers it appropriate to draw a line under the saddam era as quickly as possible .
so much so that the execution appeared over-hasty und did n't necessarily correspond with legal fundaments .
rather , the speedy hanging appeared to have been carried out to demonstrate the iraqi government 's own power which was called into question by the americans themselves in recent weeks . maliki 's government will have to live with this burden of doubt .
whether it damages the government will very much depend on how the country reacts to the execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we certainly ca n't expect an immediate calm in the country and it remains to be seen whether that will happen in the long term .
but there 's enough reason to believe it wo n't happen .
the differences between the various groups who bomb themselves through daily life in iraq are too huge and saddam had already become too marginal for his death to suddenly change things . a missed historic chance but the quick elimination of saddam means iraq has missed a historic chance to thoroughly deal with and come to grips with his reign of terror . despite all the problems , the legal process was the right way : saddam hussein was to be held guilty for the crimes of his regime .
he was convicted for the murder of 148 shiites , but what about the 100,000 dead and those persecuted in the anfal campaign ?
what about the murdered kurds of halabja , the murdered shiites of the kuwait war ?
what about the hundreds of thousands of victims of the wars that saddam started , particularly against iran but also against kuwait ? without the main suspect , these questions will likely remain unanswered .
saddam 's end is not necessarily a hopeful new beginning for iraq .

" malignant narcissism " under his leadership from 1979 to 2003 , the baath regime ordered army deserters ' ears cut off , sentenced foreign currency traffickers to death and reportedly beheaded dozens of women for prostitution . a former cia psychologist once described saddam as suffering from " malignant narcissism , " exhibiting an extreme lack of empathy and a will to use violence , which he attributed to a troubled upbringing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein unleashed a reign of terror born poor in a mud-hut village near tikrit on april 28 , 1937 , saddam was orphaned at a young age and raised by an uncle who idolised adolf hitler .
he overcame his impoverished roots and rose to iraq 's highest office , lived in the grandest of palaces , married three times and fathered six children . in arabic , his name means " the stubborn one " or " he who strikes . "
his self-importance and cult of personality were legendary .
on his 60th birthday he commissioned a copy of the koran to be inscribed in his own blood . saddam also groomed two of his sons , uday and qusay , in his own image .
they became feared for their use of torture and rape .
the two were killed during a fire fight with us forces in the northern city of mosul in july 2003 , five months before their father was captured in a farmyard hole in the ground . ruling with an iron fist saddam , who worked in the baath party security apparatus , first made a name for himself by trying to murder iraqi leader abdul karim kassem in 1959 . wounded in the leg , the future dictator fled abroad but returned four years later and was jailed in 1964 .
within two years he had escaped and resumed clandestine work for the baath party .
in 1968 he took part in the coup that brought the party to power , marking another step in his affair with brute force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discovery of a mass grave in mahaweel , south of baghdad , in 2003 as party deputy secretary general and vice president of the all-powerful revolution command council -lrb- rcc -rrb- , he was already considered the real power behind president ahmed hassan al-bakr .
bakr lost his grip over the next decade as saddam strengthened his own , and the president finally retired for health reasons . saddam seized the mantle on july 16 , 1979 , becoming state president , general secretary of the party and president of the rcc .
in the years that followed , the modern arab state labelled the cradle of civilisation became an impoverished pariah , its fabulous oil wealth squandered . saddam guided iraq through a 1980-1988 bloodbath with iran and the rout of the 1991 gulf war over kuwait , emerging each time to claim pyrrhic victories over the corpses of his people .
he defied attempts through the united nations to ensure his disarmament - the organisation 's crushing sanctions and four nights of us and british missile strikes in december 1998 . saddam extended frequent purges of senior figures to family and friends .
those who failed to make it into exile were detained , murdered and buried in the mass graves that have been uncovered across the country . a humiliating end since his sensational capture by american troops in a hole in a ground in iraq in december 2003 , images of saddam as a gaunt and greying prisoner have been splashed across the world - with some controversial photographs even showing him just in his underwear . the 69-year-old arab nationalist , who once declared his determination to die at home and taunted enemies with outrageous bravado , was toppled days after the us-led invasion began in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous toppling of the saddam statue in 2003 his massive statue in central baghdad was pulled down on april 9 , and nine months later saddam was discovered , long-haired , bearded and bedraggled , in an underground crawlspace near tikrit . his ability to evade capture for so long was evidence of the profound influence he exerted over his people even after his ouster , as many ordinary iraqis shrank from cooperating with the occupier for fear of saddam 's return . but others saw him as a strong leader who rained inaccurate but psychologically damaging scud rockets on israel and at least briefly restored self-respect to the arab nation . nevertheless , saddam 's reign ended in defeat , his ubiquitous portraits torn down and destroyed after the occupation of his capital .

" there is an agreement on the price of gas delivered to belarus and on the price for transit " to europe , belarus governmment spokesman alexander timoshenko said . but a gazprom spokesman said that it was " premature " to talk of an agreement and stressed that a deal had yet to be signed . on friday , belarus ' president alexander lukashenko had said that his country was not going to " yield to russia 's gas blackmail . " if this blackmail continues , we will take shelter in bunkers but we will not give in , " lukashenko said on national radio less than three days before the expiry of an ultimatum to accept higher prices or see supplies cut off . sergei kyprianov , a gazprom spokesman , meanwhile told russian television that the belarussian delegation was at the state-controlled gas giant 's headquarters . " negotiations continue but for the moment there is no result . " price increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus has said the country will buckle down , but not give in currently , belarus pays $ 46.68 dollars -lrb- 35.5 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic meters - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic meters in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . sandwiched between russia and the european union , belarus has threatened to retaliate to the gas hike by refusing to allow the transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies to germany , lithuania and poland . without a contract for its own supplies , minsk argues , there can be no contract on transit , while gazprom claims belarus is preparing to dip into transiting gas should its domestic supply be cut off . " we are in the final phase of negotiations .
but we can not drag -lrb- the decision -rrb- out any more , " kypryanov said , warning minsk of the " serious consequences " for the belarussian economy of a cut in supplies . " blackmail " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas compressor station in belarus in an interview friday with the french newspaper le figaro gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev accused minsk of " grotesque blackmail " in threatening a cut in supplies to europe and spoke of a possible " rationing " leading to " shortages " in the eu .
about 5 percent of gas consumed in the eu transits through belarus . the conflict echoes last year 's winter price war between russia and ukraine over the supply and cost of gas which led to shortages in western europe .
but then the west supported pro-western president viktor yushchenko , while lukashenko has been accused by washington of running the " last dictatorship in europe . " the eu has limited itself to calling on the two parties to reach a deal that does not threaten gas transit to the west and french and german authorities have said they are not worried by the prospect of a shortage . ukraine announced on thursday its readiness to increase the transit of russian gas through its territory in case of possible disruptions on the belarus route . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.12.2006 opinion : a missed historic chance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp says that the execution of saddam hussein makes it impossible to continue with the process of dealing with and coming to terms with his reign of terror in iraq . it would be misplaced to feel sympathy for a man who himself did n't know the meaning of the word and who spent a part of his life brutally crushing those who stood in his way and who was responsible for the suffering and death of thousands of people .
the execution of saddam hussein in the early hours of the muslim sacrificial festival id el adha must have come as a release for former victims of his nearly 30-year reign of terror who did n't find peace even after the ousting of saddam .
the hanging will also likely end any remaining illusions and hopes that saddam 's supporters may have had that history could be rewritten and that lost power could be restored . it seems that the swift execution of saddam 's death sentence was meant primarily to serve these two groups .
the new iraqi leadership considers it appropriate to draw a line under the saddam era as quickly as possible .
so much so that the execution appeared over-hasty und did n't necessarily correspond with legal fundaments .
rather , the speedy hanging appeared to have been carried out to demonstrate the iraqi government 's own power which was called into question by the americans themselves in recent weeks . maliki 's government will have to live with this burden of doubt .
whether it damages the government will very much depend on how the country reacts to the execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we certainly ca n't expect an immediate calm in the country and it remains to be seen whether that will happen in the long term .
but there 's enough reason to believe it wo n't happen .
the differences between the various groups who bomb themselves through daily life in iraq are too huge and saddam had already become too marginal for his death to suddenly change things . a missed historic chance but the quick elimination of saddam means iraq has missed a historic chance to thoroughly deal with and come to grips with his reign of terror . despite all the problems , the legal process was the right way : saddam hussein was to be held guilty for the crimes of his regime .
he was convicted for the murder of 148 shiites , but what about the 100,000 dead and those persecuted in the anfal campaign ?
what about the murdered kurds of halabja , the murdered shiites of the kuwait war ?
what about the hundreds of thousands of victims of the wars that saddam started , particularly against iran but also against kuwait ? without the main suspect , these questions will likely remain unanswered .
saddam 's end is not necessarily a hopeful new beginning for iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 30.12.2006 opinion : a missed historic chance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp says that the execution of saddam hussein makes it impossible to continue with the process of dealing with and coming to terms with his reign of terror in iraq . it would be misplaced to feel sympathy for a man who himself did n't know the meaning of the word and who spent a part of his life brutally crushing those who stood in his way and who was responsible for the suffering and death of thousands of people .
the execution of saddam hussein in the early hours of the muslim sacrificial festival id el adha must have come as a release for former victims of his nearly 30-year reign of terror who did n't find peace even after the ousting of saddam .
the hanging will also likely end any remaining illusions and hopes that saddam 's supporters may have had that history could be rewritten and that lost power could be restored . it seems that the swift execution of saddam 's death sentence was meant primarily to serve these two groups .
the new iraqi leadership considers it appropriate to draw a line under the saddam era as quickly as possible .
so much so that the execution appeared over-hasty und did n't necessarily correspond with legal fundaments .
rather , the speedy hanging appeared to have been carried out to demonstrate the iraqi government 's own power which was called into question by the americans themselves in recent weeks . maliki 's government will have to live with this burden of doubt .
whether it damages the government will very much depend on how the country reacts to the execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we certainly ca n't expect an immediate calm in the country and it remains to be seen whether that will happen in the long term .
but there 's enough reason to believe it wo n't happen .
the differences between the various groups who bomb themselves through daily life in iraq are too huge and saddam had already become too marginal for his death to suddenly change things . a missed historic chance but the quick elimination of saddam means iraq has missed a historic chance to thoroughly deal with and come to grips with his reign of terror . despite all the problems , the legal process was the right way : saddam hussein was to be held guilty for the crimes of his regime .
he was convicted for the murder of 148 shiites , but what about the 100,000 dead and those persecuted in the anfal campaign ?
what about the murdered kurds of halabja , the murdered shiites of the kuwait war ?
what about the hundreds of thousands of victims of the wars that saddam started , particularly against iran but also against kuwait ? without the main suspect , these questions will likely remain unanswered .
saddam 's end is not necessarily a hopeful new beginning for iraq .

" we respect the verdict , but the german government is known to be opposed in principle to the death penalty , " merkel said in berlin on saturday after iraqi officials executed saddam in baghdad by hanging earlier that day . the chancellor added that her thoughts were with the many innocent victims of saddam 's regime . " i hope the iraqi people will be able to go their own way in peace and without violence , " she said . saddam had been sentenced to death for ordering the murder of 148 men and boys in the shiite village of dujail in 1982 . opposition politicians also criticized the execution .
free democrats foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gerhard meanwhile called the hanging of saddam " unacceptable , " and said a life sentence would have set a milestone . left party spokesman gregor gysi said the execution " did not mark the start of greater democracy in iraq . " greens spokesman fritz kuhn said iraqis needed to draw a line under the " chain of death and revenge . " saturday 's execution hides the danger that supporters of saddam hussein will in future regard the ex-dictator as a martyr , " kuhn said . europe condemns death penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein remained defiant during his trial in past months others in europe also commented on the execution . " the eu condemns the crimes committed by saddam and also the death penalty , " cristina gallach , a spokeswoman for javier solana , the eu high representative for foreign affairs , told news agency afp . france , a staunch opponent of the death penalty as well as the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , called on iraqis to work towards reconciliation and national unity after the execution . " france calls upon all iraqis to look towards the future and work towards reconciliation and national unity , " the french foreign ministry said in a statement .
" now more than ever , the objective should be a return to full sovereignty and stability in iraq .
vatican : " tragic news " the vatican called the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein tragic , saying it could feed a spirit of vengeance .
" there is a risk that it feeds the spirit of vengeance and plants the seeds for fresh violence , " vatican spokesman frederico lombardi said . the hanging of saddam hussein , early on saturday , was " tragic news " , he said on vatican radio .
" this is a reason for sadness , even if this is about a person who is guilty of serious crimes .
the position of the catholic church , which is against the death penalty whatever the circumstances , needs to be repeated again , " he said .
" putting a guilty person to death is not the way to rebuild justice and reconcile society , " lombardi added . britain : saddam ' held to account ' britain on saturday said saddam hussein had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the use of the death penalty .
" i welcome the fact that saddam hussein has been tried by an iraqi court for at least some of the appalling crimes he committed against the iraqi people , " said foreign secretary margaret beckett . " he has now been held to account . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain still has over 7,000 soldiers in iraq britain was the us ' main ally during the 2003 invasion of iraq and still has some 7,200 troops in the country .
saddam 's execution has put blair 's government in a difficult position however because of its opposition to the death penalty .
" the british government does not support the use of the death penalty , in iraq or anywhere else , " beckett said .
" we advocate an end to the death penalty worldwide , regardless of the individual or the crime .
" we have made our position very clear to the iraqi authorities , but we respect their decision as that of a sovereign nation , " she added . " iraq continues to face huge challenges .
but now it has a democratically-elected government which represents all communities and is committed to fostering reconciliation . " bush : " an important milestone " us president george w. bush meanwhile hailed saddam hussein 's execution as " an important milestone " on the road to building an iraqi democracy but warned it would not end deadly violence there .
" saddam hussein 's execution comes at the end of a difficult year for the iraqi people and for our troops , " bush said in a statement released as he prepared to usher in 2007 at his texas ranch . human rights group condemns hanging however us-based rights group human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- condemned the hanging , saying history would judge saddam 's trial and execution " harshly . " " saddam hussein was responsible for horrific , widespread human rights violations , but those acts , however brutal , can not justify his execution , a cruel and inhuman punishment , " said hrw 's international justice program director , richard dicker .

dw-world.de readers comment on the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
while some seem to think he got what he deserved , others wrote that his death might provoke further violence . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . violence creates more violence !
as an american , i am deeply troubled by the execution .
i feel we took the place of pontius pilate !
saddam should have been tried by an international court .
handing him over to the shiites caused an unjust trial , a short appeal which became a farce , and an execution , that is an affront to human dignity .
as an iraqi , i would fear those responsible for his death as much as once saddam !
it 's a " milestone " in more misery . - elisabeth heptner , us i do not feel it was a prudent move , but the bush regime does n't think through the big picture .
i see nothing more than blood shed .
a country that is attacked under false pretenses reserves the right to defend itself and suddenly they are terrorists , killed or whisked away to be inhumanely humiliated and tortured .
there needs to be intervention .
this will only get worse . - kathy wittig , us perhaps the early execution of hussein will send a signal to other potential aggressors that they may be punished after fair trial .
even the dictator could at last lament on his fate today , that if he had not pushed iraq into the wars , he would not now be walking the last steps as a disowned former tyrant . - p aul lang as a german citizen who lives in the us , i get the feeling that perhaps i 've become a bit to americanized -lrb- maybe it 's the constant violent crime here -rrb- .i think there are people on this earth who deserve to die , and hussein was certainly one .
maybe a more just punishment would be to let him loose into a crowd of all the victims , and the relatives of victims that he brutalized over the years .
justice in the basest sense of the word .
i hope it brings some type of closure to all those he tortured , raped , degraded , orphaned and murdered . - eva-maria barry saddam hussein 's trial and execution were both gross travesties of justice .
those countries that either actively or passively supported the act of capital punishment upon saddam hussein could be seen as colluding in murder .
not a positive outcome ! - m aureen t. couch that was the wrong thing , at the wrong time , in the wrong place .
i think the price will be high for the american project in the middle east and much higher for the government in iraq . - a iman yunes there are many compelling reasons to oppose the death penalty .
and there is plenty of hypocrisy to go around .
but does that nullify justice ?
will the death of saddam bring about reconciliation ?
of course not !
reconciliation is the goal of the living .
saddam has taken this option away from hundreds of his own citizens !
the perpetrator of genocide -lrb- the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national , racial , political , or cultural group -rrb- should not be treated with pity .
saddam 's trial , in accordance with the law , treated him fairly .
saddam has sentenced many to death .
now he has gotten the sentence he deserves . - e ric letourneau saddam got what he deserved .
god bless the usa - mb harvey when will the violence stop ?
executing saddam hussein solves nothing but will only create more violence . - bruce hoyer i believe that taking his life for the lives of the 148 shiite muslims in 1982 is a scam .
it is the us government 's attempt to distract the world in its shameful and distasteful attempt at controlling and occupying the second largest oil producing nation in the world .
kim jong ii , admits he has nuclear capabilities , but there 's no mention of an invasion of north korea , and he is far worse than saddam hussein .
my question is : why ca n't anyone find the admitted killer , osama bin laden ? - rich , us are we really growing spiritually by cheering somebody 's death , like some viewers in a football field ?
or are we going back in our human nature showing a total lack of a affection for the life itself , many lives were lost along the world history for sure .
but will this single event demonstrate who we really are ?
well , only god knows it . - cezar compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel on hussein execution : " we respect the verdict " saying that iraqis have missed a chance to deal with its past and might now face further violence , german and other european leaders on saturday criticized the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .

" malignant narcissism " under his leadership from 1979 to 2003 , the baath regime ordered army deserters ' ears cut off , sentenced foreign currency traffickers to death and reportedly beheaded dozens of women for prostitution . a former cia psychologist once described saddam as suffering from " malignant narcissism , " exhibiting an extreme lack of empathy and a will to use violence , which he attributed to a troubled upbringing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein unleashed a reign of terror born poor in a mud-hut village near tikrit on april 28 , 1937 , saddam was orphaned at a young age and raised by an uncle who idolised adolf hitler .
he overcame his impoverished roots and rose to iraq 's highest office , lived in the grandest of palaces , married three times and fathered six children . in arabic , his name means " the stubborn one " or " he who strikes . "
his self-importance and cult of personality were legendary .
on his 60th birthday he commissioned a copy of the koran to be inscribed in his own blood . saddam also groomed two of his sons , uday and qusay , in his own image .
they became feared for their use of torture and rape .
the two were killed during a fire fight with us forces in the northern city of mosul in july 2003 , five months before their father was captured in a farmyard hole in the ground . ruling with an iron fist saddam , who worked in the baath party security apparatus , first made a name for himself by trying to murder iraqi leader abdul karim kassem in 1959 . wounded in the leg , the future dictator fled abroad but returned four years later and was jailed in 1964 .
within two years he had escaped and resumed clandestine work for the baath party .
in 1968 he took part in the coup that brought the party to power , marking another step in his affair with brute force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discovery of a mass grave in mahaweel , south of baghdad , in 2003 as party deputy secretary general and vice president of the all-powerful revolution command council -lrb- rcc -rrb- , he was already considered the real power behind president ahmed hassan al-bakr .
bakr lost his grip over the next decade as saddam strengthened his own , and the president finally retired for health reasons . saddam seized the mantle on july 16 , 1979 , becoming state president , general secretary of the party and president of the rcc .
in the years that followed , the modern arab state labelled the cradle of civilisation became an impoverished pariah , its fabulous oil wealth squandered . saddam guided iraq through a 1980-1988 bloodbath with iran and the rout of the 1991 gulf war over kuwait , emerging each time to claim pyrrhic victories over the corpses of his people .
he defied attempts through the united nations to ensure his disarmament - the organisation 's crushing sanctions and four nights of us and british missile strikes in december 1998 . saddam extended frequent purges of senior figures to family and friends .
those who failed to make it into exile were detained , murdered and buried in the mass graves that have been uncovered across the country . a humiliating end since his sensational capture by american troops in a hole in a ground in iraq in december 2003 , images of saddam as a gaunt and greying prisoner have been splashed across the world - with some controversial photographs even showing him just in his underwear . the 69-year-old arab nationalist , who once declared his determination to die at home and taunted enemies with outrageous bravado , was toppled days after the us-led invasion began in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous toppling of the saddam statue in 2003 his massive statue in central baghdad was pulled down on april 9 , and nine months later saddam was discovered , long-haired , bearded and bedraggled , in an underground crawlspace near tikrit . his ability to evade capture for so long was evidence of the profound influence he exerted over his people even after his ouster , as many ordinary iraqis shrank from cooperating with the occupier for fear of saddam 's return . but others saw him as a strong leader who rained inaccurate but psychologically damaging scud rockets on israel and at least briefly restored self-respect to the arab nation . nevertheless , saddam 's reign ended in defeat , his ubiquitous portraits torn down and destroyed after the occupation of his capital .
a lust for power matched by a ruthless streak had brought saddam to the helm he determined never to leave , whatever the cost . us soldiers who guarded him in prison told a us magazine last year that saddam was an " oddly endearing crazy man " who still called himself the president and remained convinced the people still loved him . less than two years earlier , however , iraqis called for his death when us civilian administrator paul bremer announced saddam 's capture to the world using the dramatic words " ladies and gentlemen , we got him . " on november 5 , saddam finally learned what he must have known would be his inevitable fate : death by hanging , the fate of a common criminal , rather than his stated preference for the firing squad , which is reserved for soldiers . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic meters - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic meters in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . sandwiched between russia and the european union , belarus has threatened to retaliate to the gas hike by refusing to allow the transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies to germany , lithuania and poland . without a contract for its own supplies , minsk argues , there can be no contract on transit , while gazprom claims belarus is preparing to dip into transiting gas should its domestic supply be cut off .

but then the west supported pro-western president viktor yushchenko , while lukashenko has been accused by washington of running the " last dictatorship in europe . " the eu has limited itself to calling on the two parties to reach a deal that does not threaten gas transit to the west and french and german authorities have said they are not worried by the prospect of a shortage . ukraine announced on thursday its readiness to increase the transit of russian gas through its territory in case of possible disruptions on the belarus route . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .

the differences between the various groups who bomb themselves through daily life in iraq are too huge and saddam had already become too marginal for his death to suddenly change things . a missed historic chance but the quick elimination of saddam means iraq has missed a historic chance to thoroughly deal with and come to grips with his reign of terror . despite all the problems , the legal process was the right way : saddam hussein was to be held guilty for the crimes of his regime .
he was convicted for the murder of 148 shiites , but what about the 100,000 dead and those persecuted in the anfal campaign ?
what about the murdered kurds of halabja , the murdered shiites of the kuwait war ?
what about the hundreds of thousands of victims of the wars that saddam started , particularly against iran but also against kuwait ? without the main suspect , these questions will likely remain unanswered .
saddam 's end is not necessarily a hopeful new beginning for iraq .

the german statistics office estimates that around 400,000 women work as prostitutes .
it 's a normal job in germany - at least on paper . with annual turnover estimated at 15 billion euros -lrb- nearly $ 20 billion -rrb- a year , it 's a business that can not be ignored .
european union members states vary in their policies concerning prostitution .
in sweden , prostitutes are fined when caught turning tricks .
the netherlands and germany , however , have pushed for complete legalization , with german prostitutes able to receive vacation and health benefits . the german health ministry intends to soon present its first assessment of the situation since prostitution was legalized three years ago . all the world 's a stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states vary in their prostitution laws prostitutes go about their business in different ways .
in a brothel in hamburg , some young women prance around in stilettos and lingerie in front of potential clients .
one man sits in a red velvet chair with golden armrests , admiring the women .
music videos dancing across a television screen . other prostitutes sit in a back room and wait .
they lounge around on sofas , smoking and eating chips and cookies . natascha , an 18-year-old from russia , has been turning tricks for three months . " i used to go to school , " she said .
" then i quit , did nothing for a couple of years , and after awhile , i thought ' okay , i 'll try it out . " ' " i ended up liking it and decided to stay in hamburg , " she said , taking a drag on her cigarette .
she works six days a week . chantal , who is 28 , does not have to work so much .
she 's a " part-time prostitute . "
she earns her living primarily through a normal job .
it 's enough for her and her son to live on , but she does n't want it that way . " i do n't depend on the money ; it 's just a little extra , " she said .
chantal only circuits the brothel when she has time and is in the mood . freelancers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is shutting down a third of red light businesses to crack down on crime whether they work part or full-time , none of these women are " on staff " at the brothel .
doris , the brothel madame who herself worked as a prostitute for years , said most sex workers are not interested in a contract . " the ladies are only in the business for a short time , " she said .
" here at the brothel in hamburg , they often stay just a year or two .
and they do n't want it down on paper what they do . " as a result , most of the prostitutes have not signed up for health insurance or pension plans . one exception , however , is tamara .
the 23-year-old said sex was always her hobby , so she turned it into a job .
she has registered her job as a sex worker at the local authorities . " once everything became legal , people looked at me a bit strangely , " she said . " but i 'm upfront about everything , and do not receive money from the state - no welfare , no unemployment money , and i pay for my health insurance . " tamara is also saving money for the future , which she believes is essential . gathering figures though german law made it possible three years ago to employ prostitutes as staff - with full benefits - few have taken advantage of it , said social scientist emilya mitrovic , who conducted a survey for the union group verdi . " only those who have been in the business longer want that kind of job because they want a pension , " she said . she also said it is difficult to collect figures since insurance companies only loosely define the jobs of their insured into groups , and not individual types of employment .
in other words , rather than being defined as " prostitute " or " sex worker " in insurance companies ' computer systems , the women on health schemes may simply be in " group 913 , " which also includes hotel and restaurant workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a calling , others as a curse other , private insurance companies do not wish to have their reputations tainted so they do not provide information . " insurance companies are scared of becoming known as insuring prostitutes , " said mitrovic .
" they fear they could lose business . " stuck in a rut yet many of the women themselves feel their job is indecent . theoretically , too , the prostitutes could apply for aid as founders of new businesses , but on a practical level , most do not fulfil the requirements , said mechthild pingler of the hamburg employment agency . the prostitutes ' chances of finding other employment through state-run job placement programs are also slim . " we do not , however , offer prostitution jobs to people , " pingler stressed .
" that protects the unemployed , who through the hartz iv program are otherwise are forced to take any job not deemed ' immoral . " ' pingler has been working with prostitutes for 15 years .
hardly any of the women she knows have taken part in occupational retraining programs since most of them could not easily integrate themselves into another job market . " the biggest problem is that the women have a completely different way of working than in most other jobs , " she said .
" they may have worked hard all their lives , but prostitution is still not your classic nine-to-five job .

the netherlands and germany , however , have pushed for complete legalization , with german prostitutes able to receive vacation and health benefits . the german health ministry intends to soon present its first assessment of the situation since prostitution was legalized three years ago . all the world 's a stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states vary in their prostitution laws prostitutes go about their business in different ways .
in a brothel in hamburg , some young women prance around in stilettos and lingerie in front of potential clients .
one man sits in a red velvet chair with golden armrests , admiring the women .
music videos dancing across a television screen . other prostitutes sit in a back room and wait .
they lounge around on sofas , smoking and eating chips and cookies . natascha , an 18-year-old from russia , has been turning tricks for three months . " i used to go to school , " she said .
" then i quit , did nothing for a couple of years , and after awhile , i thought ' okay , i 'll try it out . " ' " i ended up liking it and decided to stay in hamburg , " she said , taking a drag on her cigarette .
she works six days a week . chantal , who is 28 , does not have to work so much .
she 's a " part-time prostitute . "
she earns her living primarily through a normal job .
it 's enough for her and her son to live on , but she does n't want it that way . " i do n't depend on the money ; it 's just a little extra , " she said .
chantal only circuits the brothel when she has time and is in the mood . freelancers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is shutting down a third of red light businesses to crack down on crime whether they work part or full-time , none of these women are " on staff " at the brothel .
doris , the brothel madame who herself worked as a prostitute for years , said most sex workers are not interested in a contract . " the ladies are only in the business for a short time , " she said .
" here at the brothel in hamburg , they often stay just a year or two .
and they do n't want it down on paper what they do . " as a result , most of the prostitutes have not signed up for health insurance or pension plans . one exception , however , is tamara .
the 23-year-old said sex was always her hobby , so she turned it into a job .
she has registered her job as a sex worker at the local authorities . " once everything became legal , people looked at me a bit strangely , " she said . " but i 'm upfront about everything , and do not receive money from the state - no welfare , no unemployment money , and i pay for my health insurance . " tamara is also saving money for the future , which she believes is essential . gathering figures though german law made it possible three years ago to employ prostitutes as staff - with full benefits - few have taken advantage of it , said social scientist emilya mitrovic , who conducted a survey for the union group verdi . " only those who have been in the business longer want that kind of job because they want a pension , " she said . she also said it is difficult to collect figures since insurance companies only loosely define the jobs of their insured into groups , and not individual types of employment .
in other words , rather than being defined as " prostitute " or " sex worker " in insurance companies ' computer systems , the women on health schemes may simply be in " group 913 , " which also includes hotel and restaurant workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a calling , others as a curse other , private insurance companies do not wish to have their reputations tainted so they do not provide information . " insurance companies are scared of becoming known as insuring prostitutes , " said mitrovic .
" they fear they could lose business . " stuck in a rut yet many of the women themselves feel their job is indecent . theoretically , too , the prostitutes could apply for aid as founders of new businesses , but on a practical level , most do not fulfil the requirements , said mechthild pingler of the hamburg employment agency . the prostitutes ' chances of finding other employment through state-run job placement programs are also slim . " we do not , however , offer prostitution jobs to people , " pingler stressed .
" that protects the unemployed , who through the hartz iv program are otherwise are forced to take any job not deemed ' immoral . " ' pingler has been working with prostitutes for 15 years .
hardly any of the women she knows have taken part in occupational retraining programs since most of them could not easily integrate themselves into another job market . " the biggest problem is that the women have a completely different way of working than in most other jobs , " she said .
" they may have worked hard all their lives , but prostitution is still not your classic nine-to-five job .

" you have to imagine it like this : a surgeon stands in front of a real table that resembles an operating table , " said computer scientist torsten kuhlen , who is in charge of the research team developing the virtual operating room . " a video beamer is installed within the table and in conjunction with a pair of ' stereo glasses ' which the surgeon wears , a kind of holographic image of the patient is created , " kuhlen said . the patient , thus , appears as a hologram lying on the " operating table . " simulating reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : participants must wear goggles to see virtualities for the whole process to work , the conditions in the virtual operating room must emulate real conditions as much as possible .
it 's not enough to depict organs , bones , muscles and sinews .
for the virtual operating room to be useful as a learning tool , the whole body must be visualized , right down to the various layers of the human skin . virtual operating technology must even relay the skin 's resistance in order to create a realistic feel of using a scalpel during surgery . researchers at the computing and communication center in aachen have come up with a solution for that .
a robot holding a scalpel is placed in front of the operating table .
when the surgeon grabs hold of the scalpel and cuts through the virtual skin , the robot generates the tension created by different layers of the human skin . achieving this , however , was no easy task for kuhlen and his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virtual realities are becoming increasingly more complex " to make the situation realistic , the surgeons want the virtual operating room to correspond with real time , " kuhlen said . " we have to use and sometimes develop new , very complex mathematics to create the virtual , yet realistic skin layers .
this complex mathematical rendering has to happen very fast to correspond with real time .
that means up to 60 renderings per second - 60 images are shown per second , " he said . advanced medical technology virtual realities are often used nowadays in the medical field , particularly during training .
doctors also regularly use virtual simulations to help them plan operations . computer scientist lenka yerabkova , however , is convinced that the technology being developed in aachen by far exceeds the currently available systems . " current computers applications in the field of medicine can simulate organs and change their shape , " yerabkova said . " but realistic simulations of cutting through tissue along various lines and at various depths - just like in a classic operation - have not been possible until now , " she said . up-and-coming surgeons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real operating room is a scary place for " practicing " virtual practice could not only dramatically shorten the length of real operations , but also significantly improve the training of young doctors . " a university clinic , of course , has lots of young doctors just starting out who need to be trained , " said timm wolter of aachen 's university clinic . " on the other hand , there is a limited number of patients .
and some types of operations , which are normally standard , are rarely performed in teaching hospitals , " he said . such operations , for instance , could be practiced repeatedly in virtual surgery . computer researchers in aachen are still optimizing their technology .
it will likely be another five years before the first virtual operations can be performed . ingo wagner -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de testing artificial intelligence on german soccer fields german researchers play a key role in developing the robots that robocup organizers hope will take the field against a human soccer team - and win - by 2050 .

there was even talk - some malicious , some concerned - of " the german malaise . " those times have passed .
germany is currently experiencing the biggest economic growth since its reunification in 1991 and there is no other eu country whose economy is growing as quickly . economic growth for 2006 is currently estimated at 2.5 percent , but it would come as no surprise if the federal statistical office 's official calculations came up with a larger figure .
this economic upturn is expected to continue in 2007 and into the future .
bildunterschrift : the increase in employment is a particularly important factor here .
in november , the number of unemployed sank to below the four million mark and there are two main reasons for this . not only are the unemployed receiving more support in their hunt for a job , they are also being pushed harder to look for work .
in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 30.12.2006 a recycled bottle story : from drink container to winter sweater großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what might have kept you cool in summer , might also keep you warm in winter ever wonder what happens to all those plastic bottles the germans seem to be perpetually recycling ?
well , you could be wearing them .
german waste combines with chinese know-how to create clothing from old plastic . one minute you 're drinking from it , the next you could be wearing it .
thanks to recycling technology and trade agreements between germany and china , the ice cold bottle of fizzy drink that keeps you cool on a summer 's day may eventually find its way back to you as a fleece sweater to warm you up in winter . since the beginning of 1993 , all plastic bottles in germany have been sorted from the rest of the country 's garbage for recycling purposes .
four years ago , a security duty was added to the price of pet -lrb- poly-ethylen-terephthalat -rrb- bottles in a bid to encourage more people to return them to collecting points .
as a result , the amount of bottles coming back has been overwhelming .
more than 800 million pet bottles are collected every year in germany ; the majority of them collected by the big supermarket chains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of these bottles will eventually be heading to china but what does one do with all these bottles ?
luckily , some bright spark hit on the idea of shipping the pet containers to china . the bottles are picked up from the supermarkets by a collection company , which takes them to a facility where the bottles are dissembled into pet fragments and pressed into bales .
the bales are then sold to chinese traders at a tidy profit . high prices still chea per in the long run the chinese textile industry has an immense need for plastics .
even the high prices the chinese must pay for the pet bales from germany are cheaper than if the plastic was manufactured in china .
the transport duties between hamburg and hong kong are low and the manpower in china is cheap due to less rigid controls . " once in china , the pet material is melted down and made into thin thread which can be interweaved , " said sasha schuh , manager of consultation company ascon which deal specifically in waste economy .
one pullover needs the equivalent of 16 liter bottles . once the garments have been made from the pet , they are shipped back to germany where more money is made .
a fleece sweater can go for anything between 50-100 euros -lrb- $ -rrb- .
the manufacturing process costs around 32 cents . number one market for garbage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one man 's rubbish is another man 's profit china 's ever-expanding economy - a growth rate of almost 10 percent a year - makes for a country insatiable for raw materials .
such a huge country with huge demands requires much more than its resources of oil and gas can cope with . china has become a world market leader in secondary raw materials and rubbish .
what used to go straight to the dump now ends up back on the shelves as a new product thanks mostly to the chinese . this new market has also made rubbish and raw materials more valuable .
instead of stinking garbage piles and environmentally unfriendly land fill sites , the future could see more and more high-tech factories which process waste into new products .
as such , waste materials like pet have become major economic factors .
and one day , throwing away trash never to see it again in some form may be a thing of the past . ana lehmann -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de recycling scam pops the lid off deposit debate three german thieves devised a plan to make a massive return on a moderate investment , by turning in 150,000 plastic bottles for deposit .
their scam begs the question : is n't it easier to get a job ? -lrb- 24.10.2006 -rrb- high priced raw materials make recycled rubbish attractive the high cost of raw materials is encouraging germans to recycle even more than they already do .
they 're saving money , not to mention the environment , and other countries are looking to follow in their footsteps .
-lrb- 09.07.2006 -rrb- fifa and coca-cola on collision course over plastic bottles germany has done much to promote the coming world cup 's environmental aspects but its " green goal " initiative may be under threat by main sponsor coca-cola 's plan to sell plastic bottles at the tournament .

in addition , business and industry had made such sweeping staff cuts in the past few years , that they now have to reemploy staff at an earlier stage in the economic upswing compared to the past few years . this in turn , has strengthened private consumption , removed some of the pressure off the state coffers , and reinvigorated business confidence . the german economy is stronger than ever before .
industry has streamlined production , optimized business process , and modernized products and product systems . even many of the mid-sized companies are now active in the global market .
they have not only established offices outside of germany , but also moved manufacturing plants to foreign soil .
this means an increasing percentage of german exports are being manufactured in countries with lower production costs . germany 's economic growth has been helped by the union 's moderate wage policies .
employment costs in germany have grown by less than half compared to other eu countries .
this has caused the cost of unit production to decrease , making german products more competitive in the international market . there is no doubt that germany will be the world 's biggest exporting nation in 2006 , as it has been since 2003 .
the current economic downturn in the united state will not have a significant affect on germany 's economic growth , because this will be offset by the dynamism of other markets , such as eastern europe , russia , china , india and the middle east . the strong euro also wo n't have an adverse affect .
one the one hand , the financial sector offers enough alternatives to secure against currency fluctuations and on the other hands , an expensive euro makes imports cheaper and helps with stabilizing prices . german firms are n't just achieving record turnovers , but also record profits .
the economy is robust enough to deal with the dip in private consumption expected at the beginning of next year when the 3 percent increase in sales tax is introduced . all of this means germany has an extremely positive economic outlook for 2007 . karl zawadzky is a business editor for dw-radio -lrb- kh -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany pushes euro zone forward in 2006 germany 's bundesbank said it expects the economy to grow by around 2.75 percent this year , providing " substantial impulses " for the 12-country euro zone as a whole , according to the central bank 's president .
-lrb- 14.12.2006 -rrb- germany 's economic projections bounce back optimism is high in germany after new surveys show an increase in german business confidence after a 13-year low , and forecast greater than expected gdp growth for 2007 .
-lrb- 12.12.2006 -rrb- german economic boom leads to calls for higher wages union leaders and some politicians are calling for substantial wage increases because of unexpected growth rates this year .
but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy .

when a new year draws near , we vow we 're going to lose weight , stop smoking , drink less , exercise more , be nicer to other people , look for a new job , do good deeds , call our mothers more often , say " i love you " to those who matter . robert tyminski , a san francisco-based psychologist , said all those new year 's resolutions have to do with seasonal changes and their effects on our psyches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new year 's fireworks " we 've entered a period characterized by less daylight and more darkness , and this change serves to remind us that life is a cycle with beginnings and endings , " he said . " the new year often makes us believe we can put the troubling aspects of our lives behind us and begin anew . " resolution tips the internet is full of sites that offer advice on keeping those resolutions .
most of them tell people to keep their feet firmly on the ground when making the goals .
winning the lottery , says ehow.com , is " out of your grasp . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many resolve at new year 's to lose weight instead of shooting for the near unattainable or resolving to change a major behavior pattern overnight , come up with a strategy that stays specific .
instead of resolving to " not be lazy , " something like " i want to exercise more " has a better chance of success . even better : name three days a week on which you will exercise for one hour , the site recommends . another positive " ehow " tip : " find alternatives to a behavior you want to change and make it part of your resolution plan . "
if smoking helped you to relax in the past , and you want to quit smoking , find another way to relax and practice that regularly . unrealistic expectations but making resolutions is a tricky business .
for all the promise of a new beginning with the new year , many psychologists say that setting goals too high is the surest way to fall short . " when resolutions are out of proportion to what is realistic for our circumstances , they can set someone up for a fall , " said tyminski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resolutions are personal goals to keep us on track - or intact he generally gets a flood of calls around late january and early february from people seeking help because they have been let down by resolutions made but not kept . the blues can even set in on new year 's eve since it 's a time people tend to take stock of the year just passed - at least before the champagne really starts to flow .
many people looking back realize that despite the best intentions , those resolutions fell by the wayside . " empirical studies show that new year 's resolutions generally do not stick , " jörg fengler , a psychology professor at the university of cologne , told the dpa news agency .
" most of time , we shamelessly abandon them after just a few days . " idiosyncrasies cultural differences could play a role as to how people go about resolutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then there 's always the crystal ball and tarot looking at popular new year 's resolutions listed on the us government 's portal firstgov.gov , you can glean how major problems affecting american society - obesity and debt - detemine how some people define good intentions for the new year .
the top resolutions posted : to " lose weight , pay off debt and save money . " tyminski 's own grandparents were immigrants from europe , and often encouraged a focus on improving the family 's material status . " i think prosperity may be a central point of resolutions for those in the us , " he said .
" i remember when i lived in germany that i was struck by how understated the resolutions were there . " pointing the way - with lead while resolution-making in germany might not have the sheer amplitude it does in the us , germans do like to think about the future , and many go about trying to divine it .
they do this by " pouring lead , " or bleigiessen .
it 's somewhat similar to reading tea leaves , or maybe studying animal entrails , like the ancient romans enjoyed , but considerably less messy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pouring lead " is an old custom after a festive dinner , people sit in a circle and alternately melt chunks of lead -lrb- or sometimes wax -rrb- on a spoon as they hold it over a lit candle . the molten lead is then poured from the spoon into a bucket of cold water , where it hardens immediately . the shape of the hardened lead is then interpreted by the group , and is said to reflect what the future has in store for the one who poured the lead .
an egg shape could imply an addition to the family ; a tree could mean growth in one 's capabilities ; an angel could mean goodwill .
with this tradition , if the thing promised does not come true , at least there 's something else to pin the blame on besides your own lack of discipline or personal shortcoming - it 's the lead 's fault . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness is danish life appreciation research seeks to answer one of our most daunting questions : what is the key to happiness ?

" there is an agreement on the price of gas delivered to belarus and on the price for transit " to europe , belarus governmment spokesman alexander timoshenko said . but a gazprom spokesman said that it was " premature " to talk of an agreement and stressed that a deal had yet to be signed . on friday , belarus ' president alexander lukashenko had said that his country was not going to " yield to russia 's gas blackmail . " if this blackmail continues , we will take shelter in bunkers but we will not give in , " lukashenko said on national radio less than three days before the expiry of an ultimatum to accept higher prices or see supplies cut off . sergei kyprianov , a gazprom spokesman , meanwhile told russian television that the belarussian delegation was at the state-controlled gas giant 's headquarters . " negotiations continue but for the moment there is no result . " price increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus has said the country will buckle down , but not give in currently , belarus pays $ 46.68 dollars -lrb- 35.5 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters of gas .
gazprom originally demanded an increase to $ 200 , which is closer to western european prices , unless belarus agreed to sell 50 percent of its domestic pipeline operator beltransgaz . gazprom has since reduced that demand to $ 105 per 1,000 cubic meters - $ 75 per 1,000 cubic meters in cash payments , plus the equivalent of another $ 30 in shares of beltransgaz . sandwiched between russia and the european union , belarus has threatened to retaliate to the gas hike by refusing to allow the transit of russian gas to europe , potentially hitting supplies to germany , lithuania and poland . without a contract for its own supplies , minsk argues , there can be no contract on transit , while gazprom claims belarus is preparing to dip into transiting gas should its domestic supply be cut off . " we are in the final phase of negotiations .
but we can not drag -lrb- the decision -rrb- out any more , " kypryanov said , warning minsk of the " serious consequences " for the belarussian economy of a cut in supplies . " blackmail " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a gas compressor station in belarus in an interview friday with the french newspaper le figaro gazprom vice-president alexander medvedev accused minsk of " grotesque blackmail " in threatening a cut in supplies to europe and spoke of a possible " rationing " leading to " shortages " in the eu .
about 5 percent of gas consumed in the eu transits through belarus . the conflict echoes last year 's winter price war between russia and ukraine over the supply and cost of gas which led to shortages in western europe .
but then the west supported pro-western president viktor yushchenko , while lukashenko has been accused by washington of running the " last dictatorship in europe . " the eu has limited itself to calling on the two parties to reach a deal that does not threaten gas transit to the west and french and german authorities have said they are not worried by the prospect of a shortage . ukraine announced on thursday its readiness to increase the transit of russian gas through its territory in case of possible disruptions on the belarus route . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia belarus gas pricing row sparks jitters in europe russia and belarus are meeting to try and defuse a gas war that could threaten supplies to the eu .

" you have to imagine it like this : a surgeon stands in front of a real table that resembles an operating table , " said computer scientist torsten kuhlen , who is in charge of the research team developing the virtual operating room . " a video beamer is installed within the table and in conjunction with a pair of ' stereo glasses ' which the surgeon wears , a kind of holographic image of the patient is created , " kuhlen said . the patient , thus , appears as a hologram lying on the " operating table .

it 's not enough to depict organs , bones , muscles and sinews .
for the virtual operating room to be useful as a learning tool , the whole body must be visualized , right down to the various layers of the human skin . virtual operating technology must even relay the skin 's resistance in order to create a realistic feel of using a scalpel during surgery . researchers at the computing and communication center in aachen have come up with a solution for that .
a robot holding a scalpel is placed in front of the operating table .
when the surgeon grabs hold of the scalpel and cuts through the virtual skin , the robot generates the tension created by different layers of the human skin . achieving this , however , was no easy task for kuhlen and his colleagues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virtual realities are becoming increasingly more complex " to make the situation realistic , the surgeons want the virtual operating room to correspond with real time , " kuhlen said . " we have to use and sometimes develop new , very complex mathematics to create the virtual , yet realistic skin layers .
this complex mathematical rendering has to happen very fast to correspond with real time .
that means up to 60 renderings per second - 60 images are shown per second , " he said . advanced medical technology virtual realities are often used nowadays in the medical field , particularly during training .
doctors also regularly use virtual simulations to help them plan operations . computer scientist lenka yerabkova , however , is convinced that the technology being developed in aachen by far exceeds the currently available systems . " current computers applications in the field of medicine can simulate organs and change their shape , " yerabkova said . " but realistic simulations of cutting through tissue along various lines and at various depths - just like in a classic operation - have not been possible until now , " she said . up-and-coming surgeons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real operating room is a scary place for " practicing " virtual practice could not only dramatically shorten the length of real operations , but also significantly improve the training of young doctors . " a university clinic , of course , has lots of young doctors just starting out who need to be trained , " said timm wolter of aachen 's university clinic . " on the other hand , there is a limited number of patients .
and some types of operations , which are normally standard , are rarely performed in teaching hospitals , " he said . such operations , for instance , could be practiced repeatedly in virtual surgery . computer researchers in aachen are still optimizing their technology .

" we respect the verdict , but the german government is known to be opposed in principle to the death penalty , " merkel said in berlin on saturday after iraqi officials executed saddam in baghdad by hanging earlier that day . the chancellor added that her thoughts were with the many innocent victims of saddam 's regime . " i hope the iraqi people will be able to go their own way in peace and without violence , " she said . saddam had been sentenced to death for ordering the murder of 148 men and boys in the shiite village of dujail in 1982 . opposition politicians also criticized the execution .
free democrats foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gerhard meanwhile called the hanging of saddam " unacceptable , " and said a life sentence would have set a milestone . left party spokesman gregor gysi said the execution " did not mark the start of greater democracy in iraq . " greens spokesman fritz kuhn said iraqis needed to draw a line under the " chain of death and revenge . " saturday 's execution hides the danger that supporters of saddam hussein will in future regard the ex-dictator as a martyr , " kuhn said . europe condemns death penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein remained defiant during his trial in past months others in europe also commented on the execution . " the eu condemns the crimes committed by saddam and also the death penalty , " cristina gallach , a spokeswoman for javier solana , the eu high representative for foreign affairs , told news agency afp . france , a staunch opponent of the death penalty as well as the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , called on iraqis to work towards reconciliation and national unity after the execution . " france calls upon all iraqis to look towards the future and work towards reconciliation and national unity , " the french foreign ministry said in a statement .
" now more than ever , the objective should be a return to full sovereignty and stability in iraq .
vatican : " tragic news " the vatican called the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein tragic , saying it could feed a spirit of vengeance .
" there is a risk that it feeds the spirit of vengeance and plants the seeds for fresh violence , " vatican spokesman frederico lombardi said . the hanging of saddam hussein , early on saturday , was " tragic news " , he said on vatican radio .
" this is a reason for sadness , even if this is about a person who is guilty of serious crimes .
the position of the catholic church , which is against the death penalty whatever the circumstances , needs to be repeated again , " he said .
" putting a guilty person to death is not the way to rebuild justice and reconcile society , " lombardi added . britain : saddam ' held to account ' britain on saturday said saddam hussein had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the use of the death penalty .
" i welcome the fact that saddam hussein has been tried by an iraqi court for at least some of the appalling crimes he committed against the iraqi people , " said foreign secretary margaret beckett . " he has now been held to account . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain still has over 7,000 soldiers in iraq britain was the us ' main ally during the 2003 invasion of iraq and still has some 7,200 troops in the country .
saddam 's execution has put blair 's government in a difficult position however because of its opposition to the death penalty .
" the british government does not support the use of the death penalty , in iraq or anywhere else , " beckett said .
" we advocate an end to the death penalty worldwide , regardless of the individual or the crime .
" we have made our position very clear to the iraqi authorities , but we respect their decision as that of a sovereign nation , " she added . " iraq continues to face huge challenges .
but now it has a democratically-elected government which represents all communities and is committed to fostering reconciliation . " bush : " an important milestone " us president george w. bush meanwhile hailed saddam hussein 's execution as " an important milestone " on the road to building an iraqi democracy but warned it would not end deadly violence there .
" saddam hussein 's execution comes at the end of a difficult year for the iraqi people and for our troops , " bush said in a statement released as he prepared to usher in 2007 at his texas ranch . human rights group condemns hanging however us-based rights group human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- condemned the hanging , saying history would judge saddam 's trial and execution " harshly . " " saddam hussein was responsible for horrific , widespread human rights violations , but those acts , however brutal , can not justify his execution , a cruel and inhuman punishment , " said hrw 's international justice program director , richard dicker .
" the test of a government 's commitment to human rights is measured by the way it treats its worst offenders , " he said .

" we respect the verdict , but the german government is known to be opposed in principle to the death penalty , " merkel said in berlin on saturday after iraqi officials executed saddam in baghdad by hanging earlier that day . the chancellor added that her thoughts were with the many innocent victims of saddam 's regime . " i hope the iraqi people will be able to go their own way in peace and without violence , " she said . saddam had been sentenced to death for ordering the murder of 148 men and boys in the shiite village of dujail in 1982 . opposition politicians also criticized the execution .
free democrats foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gerhard meanwhile called the hanging of saddam " unacceptable , " and said a life sentence would have set a milestone . left party spokesman gregor gysi said the execution " did not mark the start of greater democracy in iraq . " greens spokesman fritz kuhn said iraqis needed to draw a line under the " chain of death and revenge . " saturday 's execution hides the danger that supporters of saddam hussein will in future regard the ex-dictator as a martyr , " kuhn said . europe condemns death penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein remained defiant during his trial in past months others in europe also commented on the execution . " the eu condemns the crimes committed by saddam and also the death penalty , " cristina gallach , a spokeswoman for javier solana , the eu high representative for foreign affairs , told news agency afp . france , a staunch opponent of the death penalty as well as the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , called on iraqis to work towards reconciliation and national unity after the execution . " france calls upon all iraqis to look towards the future and work towards reconciliation and national unity , " the french foreign ministry said in a statement .
" now more than ever , the objective should be a return to full sovereignty and stability in iraq .
vatican : " tragic news " the vatican called the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein tragic , saying it could feed a spirit of vengeance .
" there is a risk that it feeds the spirit of vengeance and plants the seeds for fresh violence , " vatican spokesman frederico lombardi said . the hanging of saddam hussein , early on saturday , was " tragic news " , he said on vatican radio .
" this is a reason for sadness , even if this is about a person who is guilty of serious crimes .
the position of the catholic church , which is against the death penalty whatever the circumstances , needs to be repeated again , " he said .
" putting a guilty person to death is not the way to rebuild justice and reconcile society , " lombardi added . britain : saddam ' held to account ' britain on saturday said saddam hussein had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the use of the death penalty .
" i welcome the fact that saddam hussein has been tried by an iraqi court for at least some of the appalling crimes he committed against the iraqi people , " said foreign secretary margaret beckett . " he has now been held to account . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain still has over 7,000 soldiers in iraq britain was the us ' main ally during the 2003 invasion of iraq and still has some 7,200 troops in the country .
saddam 's execution has put blair 's government in a difficult position however because of its opposition to the death penalty .
" the british government does not support the use of the death penalty , in iraq or anywhere else , " beckett said .
" we advocate an end to the death penalty worldwide , regardless of the individual or the crime .
" we have made our position very clear to the iraqi authorities , but we respect their decision as that of a sovereign nation , " she added . " iraq continues to face huge challenges .
but now it has a democratically-elected government which represents all communities and is committed to fostering reconciliation . " bush : " an important milestone " us president george w. bush meanwhile hailed saddam hussein 's execution as " an important milestone " on the road to building an iraqi democracy but warned it would not end deadly violence there .
" saddam hussein 's execution comes at the end of a difficult year for the iraqi people and for our troops , " bush said in a statement released as he prepared to usher in 2007 at his texas ranch . human rights group condemns hanging however us-based rights group human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- condemned the hanging , saying history would judge saddam 's trial and execution " harshly . " " saddam hussein was responsible for horrific , widespread human rights violations , but those acts , however brutal , can not justify his execution , a cruel and inhuman punishment , " said hrw 's international justice program director , richard dicker .

in other words , rather than being defined as " prostitute " or " sex worker " in insurance companies ' computer systems , the women on health schemes may simply be in " group 913 , " which also includes hotel and restaurant workers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a calling , others as a curse other , private insurance companies do not wish to have their reputations tainted so they do not provide information .

" that protects the unemployed , who through the hartz iv program are otherwise are forced to take any job not deemed ' immoral . " ' pingler has been working with prostitutes for 15 years .

champagne bottles pop and couples kiss when the clock strikes midnight .
the dawn of a new year offers people the promise of positive change . we all do it .
when a new year draws near , we vow we 're going to lose weight , stop smoking , drink less , exercise more , be nicer to other people , look for a new job , do good deeds , call our mothers more often , say " i love you " to those who matter . robert tyminski , a san francisco-based psychologist , said all those new year 's resolutions have to do with seasonal changes and their effects on our psyches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new year 's fireworks " we 've entered a period characterized by less daylight and more darkness , and this change serves to remind us that life is a cycle with beginnings and endings , " he said . " the new year often makes us believe we can put the troubling aspects of our lives behind us and begin anew . " resolution tips the internet is full of sites that offer advice on keeping those resolutions .
most of them tell people to keep their feet firmly on the ground when making the goals .
winning the lottery , says ehow.com , is " out of your grasp . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many resolve at new year 's to lose weight instead of shooting for the near unattainable or resolving to change a major behavior pattern overnight , come up with a strategy that stays specific .
instead of resolving to " not be lazy , " something like " i want to exercise more " has a better chance of success . even better : name three days a week on which you will exercise for one hour , the site recommends . another positive " ehow " tip : " find alternatives to a behavior you want to change and make it part of your resolution plan . "
if smoking helped you to relax in the past , and you want to quit smoking , find another way to relax and practice that regularly . unrealistic expectations but making resolutions is a tricky business .
for all the promise of a new beginning with the new year , many psychologists say that setting goals too high is the surest way to fall short . " when resolutions are out of proportion to what is realistic for our circumstances , they can set someone up for a fall , " said tyminski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resolutions are personal goals to keep us on track - or intact he generally gets a flood of calls around late january and early february from people seeking help because they have been let down by resolutions made but not kept . the blues can even set in on new year 's eve since it 's a time people tend to take stock of the year just passed - at least before the champagne really starts to flow .
many people looking back realize that despite the best intentions , those resolutions fell by the wayside . " empirical studies show that new year 's resolutions generally do not stick , " jörg fengler , a psychology professor at the university of cologne , told the dpa news agency .
" most of time , we shamelessly abandon them after just a few days . " idiosyncrasies cultural differences could play a role as to how people go about resolutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then there 's always the crystal ball and tarot looking at popular new year 's resolutions listed on the us government 's portal firstgov.gov , you can glean how major problems affecting american society - obesity and debt - detemine how some people define good intentions for the new year .
the top resolutions posted : to " lose weight , pay off debt and save money . " tyminski 's own grandparents were immigrants from europe , and often encouraged a focus on improving the family 's material status . " i think prosperity may be a central point of resolutions for those in the us , " he said .
" i remember when i lived in germany that i was struck by how understated the resolutions were there . " pointing the way - with lead while resolution-making in germany might not have the sheer amplitude it does in the us , germans do like to think about the future , and many go about trying to divine it .
they do this by " pouring lead , " or bleigiessen .
it 's somewhat similar to reading tea leaves , or maybe studying animal entrails , like the ancient romans enjoyed , but considerably less messy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pouring lead " is an old custom after a festive dinner , people sit in a circle and alternately melt chunks of lead -lrb- or sometimes wax -rrb- on a spoon as they hold it over a lit candle . the molten lead is then poured from the spoon into a bucket of cold water , where it hardens immediately . the shape of the hardened lead is then interpreted by the group , and is said to reflect what the future has in store for the one who poured the lead .
an egg shape could imply an addition to the family ; a tree could mean growth in one 's capabilities ; an angel could mean goodwill .
with this tradition , if the thing promised does not come true , at least there 's something else to pin the blame on besides your own lack of discipline or personal shortcoming - it 's the lead 's fault . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness is danish life appreciation research seeks to answer one of our most daunting questions : what is the key to happiness ?

" we respect the verdict , but the german government is known to be opposed in principle to the death penalty , " merkel said in berlin on saturday after iraqi officials executed saddam in baghdad by hanging earlier that day . the chancellor added that her thoughts were with the many innocent victims of saddam 's regime . " i hope the iraqi people will be able to go their own way in peace and without violence , " she said . saddam had been sentenced to death for ordering the murder of 148 men and boys in the shiite village of dujail in 1982 . opposition politicians also criticized the execution .
free democrats foreign policy spokesman wolfgang gerhard meanwhile called the hanging of saddam " unacceptable , " and said a life sentence would have set a milestone . left party spokesman gregor gysi said the execution " did not mark the start of greater democracy in iraq . " greens spokesman fritz kuhn said iraqis needed to draw a line under the " chain of death and revenge . " saturday 's execution hides the danger that supporters of saddam hussein will in future regard the ex-dictator as a martyr , " kuhn said . europe condemns death penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein remained defiant during his trial in past months others in europe also commented on the execution . " the eu condemns the crimes committed by saddam and also the death penalty , " cristina gallach , a spokeswoman for javier solana , the eu high representative for foreign affairs , told news agency afp . france , a staunch opponent of the death penalty as well as the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , called on iraqis to work towards reconciliation and national unity after the execution . " france calls upon all iraqis to look towards the future and work towards reconciliation and national unity , " the french foreign ministry said in a statement .
" now more than ever , the objective should be a return to full sovereignty and stability in iraq .
vatican : " tragic news " the vatican called the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein tragic , saying it could feed a spirit of vengeance .
" there is a risk that it feeds the spirit of vengeance and plants the seeds for fresh violence , " vatican spokesman frederico lombardi said . the hanging of saddam hussein , early on saturday , was " tragic news " , he said on vatican radio .
" this is a reason for sadness , even if this is about a person who is guilty of serious crimes .
the position of the catholic church , which is against the death penalty whatever the circumstances , needs to be repeated again , " he said .
" putting a guilty person to death is not the way to rebuild justice and reconcile society , " lombardi added . britain : saddam ' held to account ' britain on saturday said saddam hussein had been " held to account " but reiterated its opposition to the use of the death penalty .
" i welcome the fact that saddam hussein has been tried by an iraqi court for at least some of the appalling crimes he committed against the iraqi people , " said foreign secretary margaret beckett . " he has now been held to account . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain still has over 7,000 soldiers in iraq britain was the us ' main ally during the 2003 invasion of iraq and still has some 7,200 troops in the country .
saddam 's execution has put blair 's government in a difficult position however because of its opposition to the death penalty .
" the british government does not support the use of the death penalty , in iraq or anywhere else , " beckett said .
" we advocate an end to the death penalty worldwide , regardless of the individual or the crime .
" we have made our position very clear to the iraqi authorities , but we respect their decision as that of a sovereign nation , " she added . " iraq continues to face huge challenges .
but now it has a democratically-elected government which represents all communities and is committed to fostering reconciliation . " bush : " an important milestone " us president george w. bush meanwhile hailed saddam hussein 's execution as " an important milestone " on the road to building an iraqi democracy but warned it would not end deadly violence there .
" saddam hussein 's execution comes at the end of a difficult year for the iraqi people and for our troops , " bush said in a statement released as he prepared to usher in 2007 at his texas ranch . human rights group condemns hanging however us-based rights group human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- condemned the hanging , saying history would judge saddam 's trial and execution " harshly . " " saddam hussein was responsible for horrific , widespread human rights violations , but those acts , however brutal , can not justify his execution , a cruel and inhuman punishment , " said hrw 's international justice program director , richard dicker .
" the test of a government 's commitment to human rights is measured by the way it treats its worst offenders , " he said .

champagne bottles pop and couples kiss when the clock strikes midnight .
the dawn of a new year offers people the promise of positive change . we all do it .
when a new year draws near , we vow we 're going to lose weight , stop smoking , drink less , exercise more , be nicer to other people , look for a new job , do good deeds , call our mothers more often , say " i love you " to those who matter . robert tyminski , a san francisco-based psychologist , said all those new year 's resolutions have to do with seasonal changes and their effects on our psyches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new year 's fireworks " we 've entered a period characterized by less daylight and more darkness , and this change serves to remind us that life is a cycle with beginnings and endings , " he said . " the new year often makes us believe we can put the troubling aspects of our lives behind us and begin anew . " resolution tips the internet is full of sites that offer advice on keeping those resolutions .
most of them tell people to keep their feet firmly on the ground when making the goals .
winning the lottery , says ehow.com , is " out of your grasp . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many resolve at new year 's to lose weight instead of shooting for the near unattainable or resolving to change a major behavior pattern overnight , come up with a strategy that stays specific .
instead of resolving to " not be lazy , " something like " i want to exercise more " has a better chance of success . even better : name three days a week on which you will exercise for one hour , the site recommends . another positive " ehow " tip : " find alternatives to a behavior you want to change and make it part of your resolution plan . "
if smoking helped you to relax in the past , and you want to quit smoking , find another way to relax and practice that regularly . unrealistic expectations but making resolutions is a tricky business .
for all the promise of a new beginning with the new year , many psychologists say that setting goals too high is the surest way to fall short . " when resolutions are out of proportion to what is realistic for our circumstances , they can set someone up for a fall , " said tyminski . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resolutions are personal goals to keep us on track - or intact he generally gets a flood of calls around late january and early february from people seeking help because they have been let down by resolutions made but not kept . the blues can even set in on new year 's eve since it 's a time people tend to take stock of the year just passed - at least before the champagne really starts to flow .
many people looking back realize that despite the best intentions , those resolutions fell by the wayside . " empirical studies show that new year 's resolutions generally do not stick , " jörg fengler , a psychology professor at the university of cologne , told the dpa news agency .
" most of time , we shamelessly abandon them after just a few days . " idiosyncrasies cultural differences could play a role as to how people go about resolutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then there 's always the crystal ball and tarot looking at popular new year 's resolutions listed on the us government 's portal firstgov.gov , you can glean how major problems affecting american society - obesity and debt - detemine how some people define good intentions for the new year .
the top resolutions posted : to " lose weight , pay off debt and save money . " tyminski 's own grandparents were immigrants from europe , and often encouraged a focus on improving the family 's material status . " i think prosperity may be a central point of resolutions for those in the us , " he said .
" i remember when i lived in germany that i was struck by how understated the resolutions were there . " pointing the way - with lead while resolution-making in germany might not have the sheer amplitude it does in the us , germans do like to think about the future , and many go about trying to divine it .
they do this by " pouring lead , " or bleigiessen .
it 's somewhat similar to reading tea leaves , or maybe studying animal entrails , like the ancient romans enjoyed , but considerably less messy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pouring lead " is an old custom after a festive dinner , people sit in a circle and alternately melt chunks of lead -lrb- or sometimes wax -rrb- on a spoon as they hold it over a lit candle . the molten lead is then poured from the spoon into a bucket of cold water , where it hardens immediately . the shape of the hardened lead is then interpreted by the group , and is said to reflect what the future has in store for the one who poured the lead .
an egg shape could imply an addition to the family ; a tree could mean growth in one 's capabilities ; an angel could mean goodwill .
with this tradition , if the thing promised does not come true , at least there 's something else to pin the blame on besides your own lack of discipline or personal shortcoming - it 's the lead 's fault . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness is danish life appreciation research seeks to answer one of our most daunting questions : what is the key to happiness ?

dw-world.de readers comment on the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
while some seem to think he got what he deserved , others wrote that his death might provoke further violence . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . violence creates more violence !
as an american , i am deeply troubled by the execution .
i feel we took the place of pontius pilate !
saddam should have been tried by an international court .
handing him over to the shiites caused an unjust trial , a short appeal which became a farce , and an execution , that is an affront to human dignity .
as an iraqi , i would fear those responsible for his death as much as once saddam !
it 's a " milestone " in more misery . - elisabeth heptner , us i do not feel it was a prudent move , but the bush regime does n't think through the big picture .
i see nothing more than blood shed .
a country that is attacked under false pretenses reserves the right to defend itself and suddenly they are terrorists , killed or whisked away to be inhumanely humiliated and tortured .
there needs to be intervention .
this will only get worse . - kathy wittig , us perhaps the early execution of hussein will send a signal to other potential aggressors that they may be punished after fair trial .
even the dictator could at last lament on his fate today , that if he had not pushed iraq into the wars , he would not now be walking the last steps as a disowned former tyrant . - p aul lang as a german citizen who lives in the us , i get the feeling that perhaps i 've become a bit to americanized -lrb- maybe it 's the constant violent crime here -rrb- .i think there are people on this earth who deserve to die , and hussein was certainly one .
maybe a more just punishment would be to let him loose into a crowd of all the victims , and the relatives of victims that he brutalized over the years .
justice in the basest sense of the word .
i hope it brings some type of closure to all those he tortured , raped , degraded , orphaned and murdered . - eva-maria barry saddam hussein 's trial and execution were both gross travesties of justice .
those countries that either actively or passively supported the act of capital punishment upon saddam hussein could be seen as colluding in murder .
not a positive outcome ! - m aureen t. couch that was the wrong thing , at the wrong time , in the wrong place .
i think the price will be high for the american project in the middle east and much higher for the government in iraq . - a iman yunes there are many compelling reasons to oppose the death penalty .
and there is plenty of hypocrisy to go around .
but does that nullify justice ?
will the death of saddam bring about reconciliation ?
of course not !
reconciliation is the goal of the living .
saddam has taken this option away from hundreds of his own citizens !
the perpetrator of genocide -lrb- the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national , racial , political , or cultural group -rrb- should not be treated with pity .
saddam 's trial , in accordance with the law , treated him fairly .
saddam has sentenced many to death .
now he has gotten the sentence he deserves . - e ric letourneau saddam got what he deserved .
god bless the usa - mb harvey when will the violence stop ?
executing saddam hussein solves nothing but will only create more violence . - bruce hoyer i believe that taking his life for the lives of the 148 shiite muslims in 1982 is a scam .
it is the us government 's attempt to distract the world in its shameful and distasteful attempt at controlling and occupying the second largest oil producing nation in the world .
kim jong ii , admits he has nuclear capabilities , but there 's no mention of an invasion of north korea , and he is far worse than saddam hussein .
my question is : why ca n't anyone find the admitted killer , osama bin laden ? - rich , us are we really growing spiritually by cheering somebody 's death , like some viewers in a football field ?
or are we going back in our human nature showing a total lack of a affection for the life itself , many lives were lost along the world history for sure .
but will this single event demonstrate who we really are ?
well , only god knows it . - cezar compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel on hussein execution : " we respect the verdict " saying that iraqis have missed a chance to deal with its past and might now face further violence , german and other european leaders on saturday criticized the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .

the execution of saddam hussein in the early hours of the muslim sacrificial festival id el adha must have come as a release for former victims of his nearly 30-year reign of terror who did n't find peace even after the ousting of saddam .
the hanging will also likely end any remaining illusions and hopes that saddam 's supporters may have had that history could be rewritten and that lost power could be restored . it seems that the swift execution of saddam 's death sentence was meant primarily to serve these two groups .
the new iraqi leadership considers it appropriate to draw a line under the saddam era as quickly as possible .
so much so that the execution appeared over-hasty und did n't necessarily correspond with legal fundaments .
rather , the speedy hanging appeared to have been carried out to demonstrate the iraqi government 's own power which was called into question by the americans themselves in recent weeks . maliki 's government will have to live with this burden of doubt .
whether it damages the government will very much depend on how the country reacts to the execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we certainly ca n't expect an immediate calm in the country and it remains to be seen whether that will happen in the long term .
but there 's enough reason to believe it wo n't happen .
the differences between the various groups who bomb themselves through daily life in iraq are too huge and saddam had already become too marginal for his death to suddenly change things . a missed historic chance but the quick elimination of saddam means iraq has missed a historic chance to thoroughly deal with and come to grips with his reign of terror . despite all the problems , the legal process was the right way : saddam hussein was to be held guilty for the crimes of his regime .
he was convicted for the murder of 148 shiites , but what about the 100,000 dead and those persecuted in the anfal campaign ?
what about the murdered kurds of halabja , the murdered shiites of the kuwait war ?
what about the hundreds of thousands of victims of the wars that saddam started , particularly against iran but also against kuwait ? without the main suspect , these questions will likely remain unanswered .
saddam 's end is not necessarily a hopeful new beginning for iraq .

" malignant narcissism " under his leadership from 1979 to 2003 , the baath regime ordered army deserters ' ears cut off , sentenced foreign currency traffickers to death and reportedly beheaded dozens of women for prostitution . a former cia psychologist once described saddam as suffering from " malignant narcissism , " exhibiting an extreme lack of empathy and a will to use violence , which he attributed to a troubled upbringing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein unleashed a reign of terror born poor in a mud-hut village near tikrit on april 28 , 1937 , saddam was orphaned at a young age and raised by an uncle who idolised adolf hitler .
he overcame his impoverished roots and rose to iraq 's highest office , lived in the grandest of palaces , married three times and fathered six children . in arabic , his name means " the stubborn one " or " he who strikes . "
his self-importance and cult of personality were legendary .
on his 60th birthday he commissioned a copy of the koran to be inscribed in his own blood . saddam also groomed two of his sons , uday and qusay , in his own image .
they became feared for their use of torture and rape .
the two were killed during a fire fight with us forces in the northern city of mosul in july 2003 , five months before their father was captured in a farmyard hole in the ground . ruling with an iron fist saddam , who worked in the baath party security apparatus , first made a name for himself by trying to murder iraqi leader abdul karim kassem in 1959 . wounded in the leg , the future dictator fled abroad but returned four years later and was jailed in 1964 .
within two years he had escaped and resumed clandestine work for the baath party .
in 1968 he took part in the coup that brought the party to power , marking another step in his affair with brute force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discovery of a mass grave in mahaweel , south of baghdad , in 2003 as party deputy secretary general and vice president of the all-powerful revolution command council -lrb- rcc -rrb- , he was already considered the real power behind president ahmed hassan al-bakr .
bakr lost his grip over the next decade as saddam strengthened his own , and the president finally retired for health reasons . saddam seized the mantle on july 16 , 1979 , becoming state president , general secretary of the party and president of the rcc .
in the years that followed , the modern arab state labelled the cradle of civilisation became an impoverished pariah , its fabulous oil wealth squandered . saddam guided iraq through a 1980-1988 bloodbath with iran and the rout of the 1991 gulf war over kuwait , emerging each time to claim pyrrhic victories over the corpses of his people .
he defied attempts through the united nations to ensure his disarmament - the organisation 's crushing sanctions and four nights of us and british missile strikes in december 1998 . saddam extended frequent purges of senior figures to family and friends .
those who failed to make it into exile were detained , murdered and buried in the mass graves that have been uncovered across the country . a humiliating end since his sensational capture by american troops in a hole in a ground in iraq in december 2003 , images of saddam as a gaunt and greying prisoner have been splashed across the world - with some controversial photographs even showing him just in his underwear . the 69-year-old arab nationalist , who once declared his determination to die at home and taunted enemies with outrageous bravado , was toppled days after the us-led invasion began in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous toppling of the saddam statue in 2003 his massive statue in central baghdad was pulled down on april 9 , and nine months later saddam was discovered , long-haired , bearded and bedraggled , in an underground crawlspace near tikrit . his ability to evade capture for so long was evidence of the profound influence he exerted over his people even after his ouster , as many ordinary iraqis shrank from cooperating with the occupier for fear of saddam 's return . but others saw him as a strong leader who rained inaccurate but psychologically damaging scud rockets on israel and at least briefly restored self-respect to the arab nation . nevertheless , saddam 's reign ended in defeat , his ubiquitous portraits torn down and destroyed after the occupation of his capital .
a lust for power matched by a ruthless streak had brought saddam to the helm he determined never to leave , whatever the cost . us soldiers who guarded him in prison told a us magazine last year that saddam was an " oddly endearing crazy man " who still called himself the president and remained convinced the people still loved him . less than two years earlier , however , iraqis called for his death when us civilian administrator paul bremer announced saddam 's capture to the world using the dramatic words " ladies and gentlemen , we got him . " on november 5 , saddam finally learned what he must have known would be his inevitable fate : death by hanging , the fate of a common criminal , rather than his stated preference for the firing squad , which is reserved for soldiers . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

as an american , i am deeply troubled by the execution .
i feel we took the place of pontius pilate !
saddam should have been tried by an international court .
handing him over to the shiites caused an unjust trial , a short appeal which became a farce , and an execution , that is an affront to human dignity .
as an iraqi , i would fear those responsible for his death as much as once saddam !
it 's a " milestone " in more misery . - elisabeth heptner , us i do not feel it was a prudent move , but the bush regime does n't think through the big picture .
i see nothing more than blood shed .
a country that is attacked under false pretenses reserves the right to defend itself and suddenly they are terrorists , killed or whisked away to be inhumanely humiliated and tortured .
there needs to be intervention .
this will only get worse . - kathy wittig , us perhaps the early execution of hussein will send a signal to other potential aggressors that they may be punished after fair trial .
even the dictator could at last lament on his fate today , that if he had not pushed iraq into the wars , he would not now be walking the last steps as a disowned former tyrant . - p aul lang as a german citizen who lives in the us , i get the feeling that perhaps i 've become a bit to americanized -lrb- maybe it 's the constant violent crime here -rrb- .i think there are people on this earth who deserve to die , and hussein was certainly one .

justice in the basest sense of the word .
i hope it brings some type of closure to all those he tortured , raped , degraded , orphaned and murdered . - eva-maria barry saddam hussein 's trial and execution were both gross travesties of justice .
those countries that either actively or passively supported the act of capital punishment upon saddam hussein could be seen as colluding in murder .
not a positive outcome ! - m aureen t. couch that was the wrong thing , at the wrong time , in the wrong place .
i think the price will be high for the american project in the middle east and much higher for the government in iraq . - a iman yunes there are many compelling reasons to oppose the death penalty .
and there is plenty of hypocrisy to go around .
but does that nullify justice ?
will the death of saddam bring about reconciliation ?
of course not !
reconciliation is the goal of the living .
saddam has taken this option away from hundreds of his own citizens !
the perpetrator of genocide -lrb- the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national , racial , political , or cultural group -rrb- should not be treated with pity .
saddam 's trial , in accordance with the law , treated him fairly .
saddam has sentenced many to death .
now he has gotten the sentence he deserves . - e ric letourneau saddam got what he deserved .

executing saddam hussein solves nothing but will only create more violence . - bruce hoyer i believe that taking his life for the lives of the 148 shiite muslims in 1982 is a scam .

" malignant narcissism " under his leadership from 1979 to 2003 , the baath regime ordered army deserters ' ears cut off , sentenced foreign currency traffickers to death and reportedly beheaded dozens of women for prostitution . a former cia psychologist once described saddam as suffering from " malignant narcissism , " exhibiting an extreme lack of empathy and a will to use violence , which he attributed to a troubled upbringing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein unleashed a reign of terror born poor in a mud-hut village near tikrit on april 28 , 1937 , saddam was orphaned at a young age and raised by an uncle who idolised adolf hitler .
he overcame his impoverished roots and rose to iraq 's highest office , lived in the grandest of palaces , married three times and fathered six children . in arabic , his name means " the stubborn one " or " he who strikes . "
his self-importance and cult of personality were legendary .
on his 60th birthday he commissioned a copy of the koran to be inscribed in his own blood . saddam also groomed two of his sons , uday and qusay , in his own image .
they became feared for their use of torture and rape .
the two were killed during a fire fight with us forces in the northern city of mosul in july 2003 , five months before their father was captured in a farmyard hole in the ground . ruling with an iron fist saddam , who worked in the baath party security apparatus , first made a name for himself by trying to murder iraqi leader abdul karim kassem in 1959 . wounded in the leg , the future dictator fled abroad but returned four years later and was jailed in 1964 .
within two years he had escaped and resumed clandestine work for the baath party .
in 1968 he took part in the coup that brought the party to power , marking another step in his affair with brute force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discovery of a mass grave in mahaweel , south of baghdad , in 2003 as party deputy secretary general and vice president of the all-powerful revolution command council -lrb- rcc -rrb- , he was already considered the real power behind president ahmed hassan al-bakr .
bakr lost his grip over the next decade as saddam strengthened his own , and the president finally retired for health reasons . saddam seized the mantle on july 16 , 1979 , becoming state president , general secretary of the party and president of the rcc .
in the years that followed , the modern arab state labelled the cradle of civilisation became an impoverished pariah , its fabulous oil wealth squandered . saddam guided iraq through a 1980-1988 bloodbath with iran and the rout of the 1991 gulf war over kuwait , emerging each time to claim pyrrhic victories over the corpses of his people .
he defied attempts through the united nations to ensure his disarmament - the organisation 's crushing sanctions and four nights of us and british missile strikes in december 1998 . saddam extended frequent purges of senior figures to family and friends .
those who failed to make it into exile were detained , murdered and buried in the mass graves that have been uncovered across the country . a humiliating end since his sensational capture by american troops in a hole in a ground in iraq in december 2003 , images of saddam as a gaunt and greying prisoner have been splashed across the world - with some controversial photographs even showing him just in his underwear . the 69-year-old arab nationalist , who once declared his determination to die at home and taunted enemies with outrageous bravado , was toppled days after the us-led invasion began in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous toppling of the saddam statue in 2003 his massive statue in central baghdad was pulled down on april 9 , and nine months later saddam was discovered , long-haired , bearded and bedraggled , in an underground crawlspace near tikrit . his ability to evade capture for so long was evidence of the profound influence he exerted over his people even after his ouster , as many ordinary iraqis shrank from cooperating with the occupier for fear of saddam 's return . but others saw him as a strong leader who rained inaccurate but psychologically damaging scud rockets on israel and at least briefly restored self-respect to the arab nation . nevertheless , saddam 's reign ended in defeat , his ubiquitous portraits torn down and destroyed after the occupation of his capital .
a lust for power matched by a ruthless streak had brought saddam to the helm he determined never to leave , whatever the cost . us soldiers who guarded him in prison told a us magazine last year that saddam was an " oddly endearing crazy man " who still called himself the president and remained convinced the people still loved him . less than two years earlier , however , iraqis called for his death when us civilian administrator paul bremer announced saddam 's capture to the world using the dramatic words " ladies and gentlemen , we got him . " on november 5 , saddam finally learned what he must have known would be his inevitable fate : death by hanging , the fate of a common criminal , rather than his stated preference for the firing squad , which is reserved for soldiers . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

dw-world.de readers comment on the execution of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
while some seem to think he got what he deserved , others wrote that his death might provoke further violence . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . violence creates more violence !
as an american , i am deeply troubled by the execution .
i feel we took the place of pontius pilate !
saddam should have been tried by an international court .
handing him over to the shiites caused an unjust trial , a short appeal which became a farce , and an execution , that is an affront to human dignity .
as an iraqi , i would fear those responsible for his death as much as once saddam !
it 's a " milestone " in more misery . - elisabeth heptner , us i do not feel it was a prudent move , but the bush regime does n't think through the big picture .
i see nothing more than blood shed .
a country that is attacked under false pretenses reserves the right to defend itself and suddenly they are terrorists , killed or whisked away to be inhumanely humiliated and tortured .
there needs to be intervention .
this will only get worse . - kathy wittig , us perhaps the early execution of hussein will send a signal to other potential aggressors that they may be punished after fair trial .
even the dictator could at last lament on his fate today , that if he had not pushed iraq into the wars , he would not now be walking the last steps as a disowned former tyrant . - p aul lang as a german citizen who lives in the us , i get the feeling that perhaps i 've become a bit to americanized -lrb- maybe it 's the constant violent crime here -rrb- .i think there are people on this earth who deserve to die , and hussein was certainly one .
maybe a more just punishment would be to let him loose into a crowd of all the victims , and the relatives of victims that he brutalized over the years .
justice in the basest sense of the word .
i hope it brings some type of closure to all those he tortured , raped , degraded , orphaned and murdered . - eva-maria barry saddam hussein 's trial and execution were both gross travesties of justice .
those countries that either actively or passively supported the act of capital punishment upon saddam hussein could be seen as colluding in murder .
not a positive outcome ! - m aureen t. couch that was the wrong thing , at the wrong time , in the wrong place .
i think the price will be high for the american project in the middle east and much higher for the government in iraq . - a iman yunes there are many compelling reasons to oppose the death penalty .
and there is plenty of hypocrisy to go around .
but does that nullify justice ?
will the death of saddam bring about reconciliation ?
of course not !
reconciliation is the goal of the living .
saddam has taken this option away from hundreds of his own citizens !
the perpetrator of genocide -lrb- the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national , racial , political , or cultural group -rrb- should not be treated with pity .
saddam 's trial , in accordance with the law , treated him fairly .
saddam has sentenced many to death .
now he has gotten the sentence he deserves . - e ric letourneau saddam got what he deserved .
god bless the usa - mb harvey when will the violence stop ?

the execution of saddam hussein in the early hours of the muslim sacrificial festival id el adha must have come as a release for former victims of his nearly 30-year reign of terror who did n't find peace even after the ousting of saddam .
the hanging will also likely end any remaining illusions and hopes that saddam 's supporters may have had that history could be rewritten and that lost power could be restored . it seems that the swift execution of saddam 's death sentence was meant primarily to serve these two groups .
the new iraqi leadership considers it appropriate to draw a line under the saddam era as quickly as possible .
so much so that the execution appeared over-hasty und did n't necessarily correspond with legal fundaments .
rather , the speedy hanging appeared to have been carried out to demonstrate the iraqi government 's own power which was called into question by the americans themselves in recent weeks . maliki 's government will have to live with this burden of doubt .
whether it damages the government will very much depend on how the country reacts to the execution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we certainly ca n't expect an immediate calm in the country and it remains to be seen whether that will happen in the long term .
but there 's enough reason to believe it wo n't happen .
the differences between the various groups who bomb themselves through daily life in iraq are too huge and saddam had already become too marginal for his death to suddenly change things . a missed historic chance but the quick elimination of saddam means iraq has missed a historic chance to thoroughly deal with and come to grips with his reign of terror . despite all the problems , the legal process was the right way : saddam hussein was to be held guilty for the crimes of his regime .
he was convicted for the murder of 148 shiites , but what about the 100,000 dead and those persecuted in the anfal campaign ?
what about the murdered kurds of halabja , the murdered shiites of the kuwait war ?
what about the hundreds of thousands of victims of the wars that saddam started , particularly against iran but also against kuwait ? without the main suspect , these questions will likely remain unanswered .

for all the promise of a new beginning with the new year , many psychologists say that setting goals too high is the surest way to fall short .

" i remember when i lived in germany that i was struck by how understated the resolutions were there . " pointing the way - with lead while resolution-making in germany might not have the sheer amplitude it does in the us , germans do like to think about the future , and many go about trying to divine it .
they do this by " pouring lead , " or bleigiessen .
it 's somewhat similar to reading tea leaves , or maybe studying animal entrails , like the ancient romans enjoyed , but considerably less messy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pouring lead " is an old custom after a festive dinner , people sit in a circle and alternately melt chunks of lead -lrb- or sometimes wax -rrb- on a spoon as they hold it over a lit candle . the molten lead is then poured from the spoon into a bucket of cold water , where it hardens immediately . the shape of the hardened lead is then interpreted by the group , and is said to reflect what the future has in store for the one who poured the lead .
an egg shape could imply an addition to the family ; a tree could mean growth in one 's capabilities ; an angel could mean goodwill .
with this tradition , if the thing promised does not come true , at least there 's something else to pin the blame on besides your own lack of discipline or personal shortcoming - it 's the lead 's fault . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness is danish life appreciation research seeks to answer one of our most daunting questions : what is the key to happiness ?

" most of time , we shamelessly abandon them after just a few days . " idiosyncrasies cultural differences could play a role as to how people go about resolutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then there 's always the crystal ball and tarot looking at popular new year 's resolutions listed on the us government 's portal firstgov.gov , you can glean how major problems affecting american society - obesity and debt - detemine how some people define good intentions for the new year .
the top resolutions posted : to " lose weight , pay off debt and save money . " tyminski 's own grandparents were immigrants from europe , and often encouraged a focus on improving the family 's material status . " i think prosperity may be a central point of resolutions for those in the us , " he said .
" i remember when i lived in germany that i was struck by how understated the resolutions were there . " pointing the way - with lead while resolution-making in germany might not have the sheer amplitude it does in the us , germans do like to think about the future , and many go about trying to divine it .
they do this by " pouring lead , " or bleigiessen .
it 's somewhat similar to reading tea leaves , or maybe studying animal entrails , like the ancient romans enjoyed , but considerably less messy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " pouring lead " is an old custom after a festive dinner , people sit in a circle and alternately melt chunks of lead -lrb- or sometimes wax -rrb- on a spoon as they hold it over a lit candle . the molten lead is then poured from the spoon into a bucket of cold water , where it hardens immediately . the shape of the hardened lead is then interpreted by the group , and is said to reflect what the future has in store for the one who poured the lead .
an egg shape could imply an addition to the family ; a tree could mean growth in one 's capabilities ; an angel could mean goodwill .
with this tradition , if the thing promised does not come true , at least there 's something else to pin the blame on besides your own lack of discipline or personal shortcoming - it 's the lead 's fault . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de happiness is danish life appreciation research seeks to answer one of our most daunting questions : what is the key to happiness ?

saddam hussein 's road to absolute power began in tikrit , central iraq , where he was born in 1937 .
his stepfather beat him as a child , introducing him to the brutality and bullying which would mark his own life .
joining up with the clandestine baath party in 1956 , he participated in a failed attempt to assassinate military ruler general abdul karim qassem .
in a country where politics was always a violent game , his talents took him swiftly to the top .
saddam hussein -lrb- left -rrb- with general al-bakr -lrb- centre -rrb- saddam was forced to flee iraq in 1959 and spent four years in exile in cairo .
back in iraq , he rose through the party ranks .
when it finally seized power from abdul rahman mohammed aref in 1968 , saddam hussein emerged as the number two figure behind gen ahmad hassan al-bakr .
now the power behind the throne , he took over when bakr was quietly shunted aside in july 1979 and began the reign of terror that was to keep him in power for so long .
saddam hussein took the posts of prime minister , chairman of the revolution command council and armed forces commander-in-chief .
within a year , he launched iraq into a massive and risky adventure .
iran-iraq conflict seeing himself as the new leader and champion of all arabs , saddam hussein poured his army across the border into western iran in september 1980 , hoping to defuse a potential threat from the new islamic revolution .
the disastrous war lasted eight years and claimed a million lives .
the president strengthened iraq 's military capability the us quietly backed him , ignoring iraq 's human rights record and atrocities like the killing of 148 people in the mostly shia town of dujail after a failed assassination attempt against him in july 1982 , and the gassing of 5,000 kurdish villagers of halabja in march 1988 .
after the ceasefire with iran that august , saddam hussein 's constant striving for regional supremacy intensified .
his experts produced special long-range missiles and pursued ambitious nuclear , biological and chemical weapons programmes .
invasion but war with iran had crippled the iraqi economy and the iraqi leader desperately needed to increase his oil revenues .
in august 1990 , he accused kuwait of driving the price of oil down , invaded and annexed the emirate .
1991 : kuwait 's oilfields ablaze weeks of us-led bombing , during what saddam hussein had famously described as the " mother of all battles " , reduced iraq 's infrastructure to ruins , and wrought havoc among front-line troops .
operation desert storm , the subsequent ground assault in january 1991 to drive iraqi forces out of kuwait left thousands of iraqi soldiers dead , wounded or captured .
retreating troops set fire to the country 's oil wells , turning day to night and precipitating a vast ecological disaster .
kurds flee but this time , the iraqi president 's blunders did lead to consequences at home .
encouraged by the first us president george bush to rise up , the shia of southern iraq revolted .
but the western powers did nothing , as saddam hussein ruthlessly restored his grip on the south .
tide of humanity : kurdish refugees in the north , he attacked the rebellious kurds .
millions fled into the freezing mountains and the west was forced to impose a " safe haven " , maintained by a constant air umbrella , over the area .
the following year , the western powers imposed a no-fly zone in the south , to give some sort of protection to the shia .
to add to his humiliations , after his ejection from kuwait , the iraqi leader was forced to agree to the elimination of all his weapons of mass destruction by the un .
' regime change ' stringent international sanctions remained in full force in the years after the gulf war , causing a near-collapse of the iraqi currency and leading to infighting in the power structure .
the first gulf war destroyed much of iraq 's infrastructure his two sons-in-law defected , but both were murdered after being persuaded to return to iraq .
president george w bush 's election in 2000 increased the pressure .
washington now talked openly of " regime change " .
and , following the 11 september 2001 attacks on washington and new york , the us named iraq a " rogue state " .
un weapons inspectors returned to iraq in november 2002 and resumed their search .
iraq destroyed a number of missiles and said it had neutralised its stocks of anthrax .
have your say as an iranian , i hated saddam for what he did to my country .
but , as a human being , i feel sorry for him farhad assar , edinburgh send us your comments mr bush remained suspicious , claiming that the iraqi leader was building and hiding weapons to dominate the middle east and intimidate the civilised world .
chief un weapons inspector hans blix reported that iraq had accelerated its co-operation and there was no evidence of a new weapons programme , but the us and uk declared the diplomatic process over .
coalition forces invaded iraq in march 2003 , despite not securing a new un resolution authorising such action .
saddam hussein 's reign was brought to a violent end and he disappeared after the fall of baghdad on 9 april , becoming the us military 's most wanted fugitive in iraq .
captured his two sons , uday and qusay , were killed by us troops in a raid on a house near mosul , northern iraq , on 22 july .
the us said saddam hussein offered no resistance and in december 2003 , us officials announced that the former president had been captured near tikrit .
while world leaders and many iraqis welcomed the capture , there were angry protests in towns throughout the iraqi area known as the sunni triangle .
saddam hussein was transferred to the iraqi authorities on 30 june 2004 following the handover of sovereignty to prime minister iyad allawi 's interim government .
his trial opened in baghdad the next day .
trial saddam hussein was defiant .
he challenged the legality of the proceedings , which he said were brought about by the " invasion forces " , and refused to sign the charge sheet without his lawyers present .
saddam hussein was filmed on a visit to the town of dujail in 1982 in july 2005 , the tribunal laid the first charges against saddam hussein and seven other former regime members for crimes against humanity in dujail .
the case was chosen by prosecutors because they believed it would be the easiest to compile and prosecute .
saddam hussein pleaded not guilty when his trial opened in baghdad on 19 october , 2005 .
his co-defendants included barzan al-tikriti , saddam hussein 's half-brother and former head of iraq 's intelligence service and awad hamed al-bandar , former revolutionary court chief judge .
all three were sentenced to death by an iraqi court on 5 november 2006 after a year-long trial .
the former president was executed 56 days after the death sentence was passed , after iraq 's highest court rejected an appeal on 25 december .
saddam hussein 's rule was characterised by a mixture of megalomania and paranoia .
his monuments were everywhere .
he even had nebuchadnezzar 's palace rebuilt , with his own name printed on the bricks .
scared for his own security , he slept in a different place every night and used up to eight doubles .
beneath the surface , his power was wielded through the armed forces and a complex web of intelligence organisations .
though he failed in his ambition of unifying the arabs under his leadership , saddam hussein remained , even after being put on trial , defiant as ever .

saddam hussein 's road to absolute power began in tikrit , central iraq , where he was born in 1937 .
his stepfather beat him as a child , introducing him to the brutality and bullying which would mark his own life .
joining up with the clandestine baath party in 1956 , he participated in a failed attempt to assassinate military ruler general abdul karim qassem .
in a country where politics was always a violent game , his talents took him swiftly to the top .
saddam hussein -lrb- left -rrb- with general al-bakr -lrb- centre -rrb- saddam was forced to flee iraq in 1959 and spent four years in exile in cairo .
back in iraq , he rose through the party ranks .
when it finally seized power from abdul rahman mohammed aref in 1968 , saddam hussein emerged as the number two figure behind gen ahmad hassan al-bakr .
now the power behind the throne , he took over when bakr was quietly shunted aside in july 1979 and began the reign of terror that was to keep him in power for so long .
saddam hussein took the posts of prime minister , chairman of the revolution command council and armed forces commander-in-chief .
within a year , he launched iraq into a massive and risky adventure .
iran-iraq conflict seeing himself as the new leader and champion of all arabs , saddam hussein poured his army across the border into western iran in september 1980 , hoping to defuse a potential threat from the new islamic revolution .
the disastrous war lasted eight years and claimed a million lives .
the president strengthened iraq 's military capability the us quietly backed him , ignoring iraq 's human rights record and atrocities like the killing of 148 people in the mostly shia town of dujail after a failed assassination attempt against him in july 1982 , and the gassing of 5,000 kurdish villagers of halabja in march 1988 .
after the ceasefire with iran that august , saddam hussein 's constant striving for regional supremacy intensified .
his experts produced special long-range missiles and pursued ambitious nuclear , biological and chemical weapons programmes .
invasion but war with iran had crippled the iraqi economy and the iraqi leader desperately needed to increase his oil revenues .
in august 1990 , he accused kuwait of driving the price of oil down , invaded and annexed the emirate .
1991 : kuwait 's oilfields ablaze weeks of us-led bombing , during what saddam hussein had famously described as the " mother of all battles " , reduced iraq 's infrastructure to ruins , and wrought havoc among front-line troops .
operation desert storm , the subsequent ground assault in january 1991 to drive iraqi forces out of kuwait left thousands of iraqi soldiers dead , wounded or captured .
retreating troops set fire to the country 's oil wells , turning day to night and precipitating a vast ecological disaster .
kurds flee but this time , the iraqi president 's blunders did lead to consequences at home .
encouraged by the first us president george bush to rise up , the shia of southern iraq revolted .
but the western powers did nothing , as saddam hussein ruthlessly restored his grip on the south .
tide of humanity : kurdish refugees in the north , he attacked the rebellious kurds .
millions fled into the freezing mountains and the west was forced to impose a " safe haven " , maintained by a constant air umbrella , over the area .
the following year , the western powers imposed a no-fly zone in the south , to give some sort of protection to the shia .
to add to his humiliations , after his ejection from kuwait , the iraqi leader was forced to agree to the elimination of all his weapons of mass destruction by the un .
' regime change ' stringent international sanctions remained in full force in the years after the gulf war , causing a near-collapse of the iraqi currency and leading to infighting in the power structure .
the first gulf war destroyed much of iraq 's infrastructure his two sons-in-law defected , but both were murdered after being persuaded to return to iraq .
president george w bush 's election in 2000 increased the pressure .
washington now talked openly of " regime change " .
and , following the 11 september 2001 attacks on washington and new york , the us named iraq a " rogue state " .
un weapons inspectors returned to iraq in november 2002 and resumed their search .
iraq destroyed a number of missiles and said it had neutralised its stocks of anthrax .
have your say as an iranian , i hated saddam for what he did to my country .
but , as a human being , i feel sorry for him farhad assar , edinburgh send us your comments mr bush remained suspicious , claiming that the iraqi leader was building and hiding weapons to dominate the middle east and intimidate the civilised world .
chief un weapons inspector hans blix reported that iraq had accelerated its co-operation and there was no evidence of a new weapons programme , but the us and uk declared the diplomatic process over .
coalition forces invaded iraq in march 2003 , despite not securing a new un resolution authorising such action .
saddam hussein 's reign was brought to a violent end and he disappeared after the fall of baghdad on 9 april , becoming the us military 's most wanted fugitive in iraq .
captured his two sons , uday and qusay , were killed by us troops in a raid on a house near mosul , northern iraq , on 22 july .
the us said saddam hussein offered no resistance and in december 2003 , us officials announced that the former president had been captured near tikrit .
while world leaders and many iraqis welcomed the capture , there were angry protests in towns throughout the iraqi area known as the sunni triangle .
saddam hussein was transferred to the iraqi authorities on 30 june 2004 following the handover of sovereignty to prime minister iyad allawi 's interim government .
his trial opened in baghdad the next day .
trial saddam hussein was defiant .
he challenged the legality of the proceedings , which he said were brought about by the " invasion forces " , and refused to sign the charge sheet without his lawyers present .
saddam hussein was filmed on a visit to the town of dujail in 1982 in july 2005 , the tribunal laid the first charges against saddam hussein and seven other former regime members for crimes against humanity in dujail .
the case was chosen by prosecutors because they believed it would be the easiest to compile and prosecute .
saddam hussein pleaded not guilty when his trial opened in baghdad on 19 october , 2005 .
his co-defendants included barzan al-tikriti , saddam hussein 's half-brother and former head of iraq 's intelligence service and awad hamed al-bandar , former revolutionary court chief judge .
all three were sentenced to death by an iraqi court on 5 november 2006 after a year-long trial .
the former president was executed 56 days after the death sentence was passed , after iraq 's highest court rejected an appeal on 25 december .
saddam hussein 's rule was characterised by a mixture of megalomania and paranoia .
his monuments were everywhere .
he even had nebuchadnezzar 's palace rebuilt , with his own name printed on the bricks .
scared for his own security , he slept in a different place every night and used up to eight doubles .
beneath the surface , his power was wielded through the armed forces and a complex web of intelligence organisations .
though he failed in his ambition of unifying the arabs under his leadership , saddam hussein remained , even after being put on trial , defiant as ever .

saddam hussein 's road to absolute power began in tikrit , central iraq , where he was born in 1937 .
his stepfather beat him as a child , introducing him to the brutality and bullying which would mark his own life .
joining up with the clandestine baath party in 1956 , he participated in a failed attempt to assassinate military ruler general abdul karim qassem .
in a country where politics was always a violent game , his talents took him swiftly to the top .
saddam hussein -lrb- left -rrb- with general al-bakr -lrb- centre -rrb- saddam was forced to flee iraq in 1959 and spent four years in exile in cairo .
back in iraq , he rose through the party ranks .
when it finally seized power from abdul rahman mohammed aref in 1968 , saddam hussein emerged as the number two figure behind gen ahmad hassan al-bakr .
now the power behind the throne , he took over when bakr was quietly shunted aside in july 1979 and began the reign of terror that was to keep him in power for so long .
saddam hussein took the posts of prime minister , chairman of the revolution command council and armed forces commander-in-chief .
within a year , he launched iraq into a massive and risky adventure .
iran-iraq conflict seeing himself as the new leader and champion of all arabs , saddam hussein poured his army across the border into western iran in september 1980 , hoping to defuse a potential threat from the new islamic revolution .
the disastrous war lasted eight years and claimed a million lives .
the president strengthened iraq 's military capability the us quietly backed him , ignoring iraq 's human rights record and atrocities like the killing of 148 people in the mostly shia town of dujail after a failed assassination attempt against him in july 1982 , and the gassing of 5,000 kurdish villagers of halabja in march 1988 .
after the ceasefire with iran that august , saddam hussein 's constant striving for regional supremacy intensified .
his experts produced special long-range missiles and pursued ambitious nuclear , biological and chemical weapons programmes .
invasion but war with iran had crippled the iraqi economy and the iraqi leader desperately needed to increase his oil revenues .
in august 1990 , he accused kuwait of driving the price of oil down , invaded and annexed the emirate .
1991 : kuwait 's oilfields ablaze weeks of us-led bombing , during what saddam hussein had famously described as the " mother of all battles " , reduced iraq 's infrastructure to ruins , and wrought havoc among front-line troops .
operation desert storm , the subsequent ground assault in january 1991 to drive iraqi forces out of kuwait left thousands of iraqi soldiers dead , wounded or captured .
retreating troops set fire to the country 's oil wells , turning day to night and precipitating a vast ecological disaster .
kurds flee but this time , the iraqi president 's blunders did lead to consequences at home .
encouraged by the first us president george bush to rise up , the shia of southern iraq revolted .
but the western powers did nothing , as saddam hussein ruthlessly restored his grip on the south .
tide of humanity : kurdish refugees in the north , he attacked the rebellious kurds .
millions fled into the freezing mountains and the west was forced to impose a " safe haven " , maintained by a constant air umbrella , over the area .
the following year , the western powers imposed a no-fly zone in the south , to give some sort of protection to the shia .
to add to his humiliations , after his ejection from kuwait , the iraqi leader was forced to agree to the elimination of all his weapons of mass destruction by the un .
' regime change ' stringent international sanctions remained in full force in the years after the gulf war , causing a near-collapse of the iraqi currency and leading to infighting in the power structure .
the first gulf war destroyed much of iraq 's infrastructure his two sons-in-law defected , but both were murdered after being persuaded to return to iraq .
president george w bush 's election in 2000 increased the pressure .
washington now talked openly of " regime change " .
and , following the 11 september 2001 attacks on washington and new york , the us named iraq a " rogue state " .
un weapons inspectors returned to iraq in november 2002 and resumed their search .
iraq destroyed a number of missiles and said it had neutralised its stocks of anthrax .
have your say as an iranian , i hated saddam for what he did to my country .
but , as a human being , i feel sorry for him farhad assar , edinburgh send us your comments mr bush remained suspicious , claiming that the iraqi leader was building and hiding weapons to dominate the middle east and intimidate the civilised world .
chief un weapons inspector hans blix reported that iraq had accelerated its co-operation and there was no evidence of a new weapons programme , but the us and uk declared the diplomatic process over .
coalition forces invaded iraq in march 2003 , despite not securing a new un resolution authorising such action .
saddam hussein 's reign was brought to a violent end and he disappeared after the fall of baghdad on 9 april , becoming the us military 's most wanted fugitive in iraq .
captured his two sons , uday and qusay , were killed by us troops in a raid on a house near mosul , northern iraq , on 22 july .
the us said saddam hussein offered no resistance and in december 2003 , us officials announced that the former president had been captured near tikrit .

saddam hussein 's road to absolute power began in tikrit , central iraq , where he was born in 1937 .
his stepfather beat him as a child , introducing him to the brutality and bullying which would mark his own life .
joining up with the clandestine baath party in 1956 , he participated in a failed attempt to assassinate military ruler general abdul karim qassem .
in a country where politics was always a violent game , his talents took him swiftly to the top .
saddam hussein -lrb- left -rrb- with general al-bakr -lrb- centre -rrb- saddam was forced to flee iraq in 1959 and spent four years in exile in cairo .
back in iraq , he rose through the party ranks .
when it finally seized power from abdul rahman mohammed aref in 1968 , saddam hussein emerged as the number two figure behind gen ahmad hassan al-bakr .
now the power behind the throne , he took over when bakr was quietly shunted aside in july 1979 and began the reign of terror that was to keep him in power for so long .
saddam hussein took the posts of prime minister , chairman of the revolution command council and armed forces commander-in-chief .
within a year , he launched iraq into a massive and risky adventure .
iran-iraq conflict seeing himself as the new leader and champion of all arabs , saddam hussein poured his army across the border into western iran in september 1980 , hoping to defuse a potential threat from the new islamic revolution .
the disastrous war lasted eight years and claimed a million lives .
the president strengthened iraq 's military capability the us quietly backed him , ignoring iraq 's human rights record and atrocities like the killing of 148 people in the mostly shia town of dujail after a failed assassination attempt against him in july 1982 , and the gassing of 5,000 kurdish villagers of halabja in march 1988 .
after the ceasefire with iran that august , saddam hussein 's constant striving for regional supremacy intensified .
his experts produced special long-range missiles and pursued ambitious nuclear , biological and chemical weapons programmes .
invasion but war with iran had crippled the iraqi economy and the iraqi leader desperately needed to increase his oil revenues .
in august 1990 , he accused kuwait of driving the price of oil down , invaded and annexed the emirate .
1991 : kuwait 's oilfields ablaze weeks of us-led bombing , during what saddam hussein had famously described as the " mother of all battles " , reduced iraq 's infrastructure to ruins , and wrought havoc among front-line troops .
operation desert storm , the subsequent ground assault in january 1991 to drive iraqi forces out of kuwait left thousands of iraqi soldiers dead , wounded or captured .
retreating troops set fire to the country 's oil wells , turning day to night and precipitating a vast ecological disaster .
kurds flee but this time , the iraqi president 's blunders did lead to consequences at home .
encouraged by the first us president george bush to rise up , the shia of southern iraq revolted .
but the western powers did nothing , as saddam hussein ruthlessly restored his grip on the south .
tide of humanity : kurdish refugees in the north , he attacked the rebellious kurds .
millions fled into the freezing mountains and the west was forced to impose a " safe haven " , maintained by a constant air umbrella , over the area .
the following year , the western powers imposed a no-fly zone in the south , to give some sort of protection to the shia .
to add to his humiliations , after his ejection from kuwait , the iraqi leader was forced to agree to the elimination of all his weapons of mass destruction by the un .
' regime change ' stringent international sanctions remained in full force in the years after the gulf war , causing a near-collapse of the iraqi currency and leading to infighting in the power structure .
the first gulf war destroyed much of iraq 's infrastructure his two sons-in-law defected , but both were murdered after being persuaded to return to iraq .
president george w bush 's election in 2000 increased the pressure .
washington now talked openly of " regime change " .
and , following the 11 september 2001 attacks on washington and new york , the us named iraq a " rogue state " .
un weapons inspectors returned to iraq in november 2002 and resumed their search .
iraq destroyed a number of missiles and said it had neutralised its stocks of anthrax .
have your say as an iranian , i hated saddam for what he did to my country .
but , as a human being , i feel sorry for him farhad assar , edinburgh send us your comments mr bush remained suspicious , claiming that the iraqi leader was building and hiding weapons to dominate the middle east and intimidate the civilised world .
chief un weapons inspector hans blix reported that iraq had accelerated its co-operation and there was no evidence of a new weapons programme , but the us and uk declared the diplomatic process over .
coalition forces invaded iraq in march 2003 , despite not securing a new un resolution authorising such action .
saddam hussein 's reign was brought to a violent end and he disappeared after the fall of baghdad on 9 april , becoming the us military 's most wanted fugitive in iraq .
captured his two sons , uday and qusay , were killed by us troops in a raid on a house near mosul , northern iraq , on 22 july .
the us said saddam hussein offered no resistance and in december 2003 , us officials announced that the former president had been captured near tikrit .
while world leaders and many iraqis welcomed the capture , there were angry protests in towns throughout the iraqi area known as the sunni triangle .
saddam hussein was transferred to the iraqi authorities on 30 june 2004 following the handover of sovereignty to prime minister iyad allawi 's interim government .
his trial opened in baghdad the next day .
trial saddam hussein was defiant .
he challenged the legality of the proceedings , which he said were brought about by the " invasion forces " , and refused to sign the charge sheet without his lawyers present .
saddam hussein was filmed on a visit to the town of dujail in 1982 in july 2005 , the tribunal laid the first charges against saddam hussein and seven other former regime members for crimes against humanity in dujail .
the case was chosen by prosecutors because they believed it would be the easiest to compile and prosecute .
saddam hussein pleaded not guilty when his trial opened in baghdad on 19 october , 2005 .
his co-defendants included barzan al-tikriti , saddam hussein 's half-brother and former head of iraq 's intelligence service and awad hamed al-bandar , former revolutionary court chief judge .
all three were sentenced to death by an iraqi court on 5 november 2006 after a year-long trial .
the former president was executed 56 days after the death sentence was passed , after iraq 's highest court rejected an appeal on 25 december .
saddam hussein 's rule was characterised by a mixture of megalomania and paranoia .
his monuments were everywhere .
he even had nebuchadnezzar 's palace rebuilt , with his own name printed on the bricks .
scared for his own security , he slept in a different place every night and used up to eight doubles .
beneath the surface , his power was wielded through the armed forces and a complex web of intelligence organisations .
though he failed in his ambition of unifying the arabs under his leadership , saddam hussein remained , even after being put on trial , defiant as ever .

a small group of iraqis , including a representative of the iraqi prime minister and a sunni muslim cleric , were brought to witness the execution .
it took place in an iraqi compound known by the americans as ' camp justice ' , a secure facility in the northern baghdad suburb of khadimeya , outside the green zone .

clemency his first trial for mass murder , beginning in 2005 , was supposed to be the nuremberg trial of our time .
yet , as ever , it proved to be divisive , and certainly did not receive general international approval .
there were questions about the nature of the evidence , and the iraqi government intervened to sack the leading judge for not being tough enough in dealing with saddam .
after he was sentenced to death , the appeals for clemency from many international leaders have been ignored .
these things will certainly continue to affect the way the world will see saddam 's death .
but now he has finally been swept off the political chessboard , the iraqi government hopes that 2007 will be a better year as a result .

barzan al-tikriti , saddam 's half brother , and the former chief judge alwad al-bandar , who were sentenced to death alongside saddam , were not with him .
they will be executed at a later date .
the trap door was released and he was hanged - the entire business took just a few minutes saddam was brought in carrying a copy of the koran , and the sentence was read out to him .
he was quiet , but handed the koran to one of the people there and asked that it should be given to a friend , whom he named .
one of the four executioners told saddam that he had ruined the country ; saddam responded firmly but quietly .
the noose was placed around his neck .
he repeated the muslim statement of faith .
when the chief executioner went to put the hood over his head , saddam made it clear he wanted to die without it .
it was his last action of defiance .
then the trap door was released and he was hanged .
the entire business took just a few minutes .
sunni despair there had been concerns that people might not believe that saddam was really dead , so the execution was videoed .
this is the end of an important and terrible chapter in iraq 's history .
how iraqis respond to it depends on their politics and their religious and ethnic background .
his unusual name - saddam - means ' the one who confronts ' , and that is what he has done for almost half a century the shia and kurdish majority here will largely be overjoyed , and the government , which is itself mostly shia , sees the execution as an important way of winning popular support .
to the sunni minority , already embittered and in despair at losing political power , this is the final evidence that they are the major losers in the events of the past few years .
like virtually everything in saddam 's long political life , reaching back to the early 1960s , his overthrow , trial and execution have divided opinion fiercely , both here and around the world .
his unusual name - saddam - means " the one who confronts " , and that is what he has done for almost half a century , invading first iran and then kuwait .
clemency his first trial for mass murder , beginning in 2005 , was supposed to be the nuremberg trial of our time .
yet , as ever , it proved to be divisive , and certainly did not receive general international approval .
there were questions about the nature of the evidence , and the iraqi government intervened to sack the leading judge for not being tough enough in dealing with saddam .
after he was sentenced to death , the appeals for clemency from many international leaders have been ignored .
these things will certainly continue to affect the way the world will see saddam 's death .
but now he has finally been swept off the political chessboard , the iraqi government hopes that 2007 will be a better year as a result .

john crosby and wife joy , who live near cardiff , both receive mbes for services to children and families .
the crosbys , who have three daughters of their own , work for rhondda cynon taf council , and said they were " staggered by this incredible news " .
mr crosby , 64 , and mrs crosby , 61 , have cared for 79 babies since june 1975 .
the crosbys only care for babies , and mrs crosby said the decades of care stemmed from her love for them .
she said : " all i 've ever wanted to do is to care for babies , and i never thought for a minute that anything such as this could happen to an ordinary person like me .
all i 've ever wanted to do is to care for babies joy crosby " if we can help babies in the first stages of their lives that means more to me than anything . "
mrs crosby added : " i could have n't done it without john and we have fostered babies aged a few hours old up to a few months old .
some have stayed with us until they were three years old . "
mr crosby said he was " staggered by this incredible news " .
" we both felt honoured when we were invited to a royal garden party at buckingham palace in 2003 , and were pleased to think that the work of foster carers could be recognised in such a way , " he added .
" but this is something else altogether , and i very much hope it sends out a message to anyone who is thinking of becoming a foster carer , that fostering is recognised nationally as a truly worthwhile vocation . "

it was the end of an inevitable process that began when saddam hussein was found in a " spider hole " on 14 december 2003 , but his capacity to upset the plans of his opponents is as strong in death as in life .
before he fell from power , saddam hussein left specific instructions to his supporters .
he knew that they could not defeat the american-led invasion force on the conventional battlefield , so he ordered his men to loot and disrupt the civilian infrastructure and join forces with islamists rebels .
those tactics continue to prevent the effective stabilisation of iraq , and the insurgency now has a momentum of its own that will outlive saddam .
