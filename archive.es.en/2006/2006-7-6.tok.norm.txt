" we will not give a response , " either wednesday evening or next tuesday , at a wider meeting of iranian officials with representatives of countries behind the international nuclear offer , the official told news agency afp .
" we are just resolving ambiguities " of the package of incentives being offered to the islamic republic , he added . leaders still hope iran will budge solana has said he expects a " first response " in the brussels talks on whether iran might be ready to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for political and economic incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad still remains defiant but iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said that tehran will give its formal response to the offer in august . russian president vladimir putin called thursday for tehran to accelerate its efforts to respond to the international community .
" the iranian leadership said it is ready for dialogue and will answer by august , " putin said while answering questions sent in by internet from around the world .
" in our view they could have done this earlier . " solana 's spokeswoman cristina gallach downplayed the significance of the latest iranian comments .
" our intention remains the same : to begin to get as much information as possible on iran 's reaction ...
we are going to start working with him ... with the aim of having a substantial response next week , " she told afp . iran is facing mounting international pressure to show by next week that it is ready to accept the offer , with the threat of un security council action hanging over it . but iran , which denies it is trying to covertly build an atomic bomb behind the screen of a civilian nuclear programme , refuses categorically to suspend enrichment activities ; a key condition of the package . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice says the us is still waiting for iran to move on their offer " we still intend to have a substantive response from iran before the middle of july ... , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said wednesday .
" it simply makes sense for the world to have some kind of indication of whether iran intends to pursue the negotiated track or not . " another meeting on iran leaders of the group of eight major industrial powers expect to examine iran 's response at a meeting in saint petersburg starting on july 15 , but , as in the past , iran has resisted all attempts to set a calendar . on wednesday , larijani tried to push back the brussels talks until next week , but solana said that " waiting another week was impossible " and " there had to be a contact before that " , according to gallach . thursday evening 's dinner comes ahead of more substantial talks in paris next tuesday , when representatives from the five permanent un security council members plus germany are expected to meet solana but not the iranian delegation , according to the eu diplomat 's office . the us state department also said that foreign ministers from the six world powers would meet to discuss iran the following day - wednesday - just before the g8 summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in the central iranian city of isfahan in their offer , the six affirm iran 's right to develop nuclear energy , support its building of light-water reactors and provide for uranium enrichment to take place in russia . it would improve tehran 's access to international markets and capital and back its efforts to join the world trade organisation , among other incentives . in return , iran would suspend all enrichment-related activities , which have sparked fears it may be trying to build a nuclear weapon , and accept wider inspections by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran dragging its feet over nuclear talks the eu is pressuring iran to accept a " very good package of incentives " in exchange for halting uranium enrichment before the g8 meeting of industrial nations on july 15 .

" we will not give a response , " either wednesday evening or next tuesday , at a wider meeting of iranian officials with representatives of countries behind the international nuclear offer , the official told news agency afp .
" we are just resolving ambiguities " of the package of incentives being offered to the islamic republic , he added . leaders still hope iran will budge solana has said he expects a " first response " in the brussels talks on whether iran might be ready to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for political and economic incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad still remains defiant but iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said that tehran will give its formal response to the offer in august . russian president vladimir putin called thursday for tehran to accelerate its efforts to respond to the international community .
" the iranian leadership said it is ready for dialogue and will answer by august , " putin said while answering questions sent in by internet from around the world .
" in our view they could have done this earlier . " solana 's spokeswoman cristina gallach downplayed the significance of the latest iranian comments .
" our intention remains the same : to begin to get as much information as possible on iran 's reaction ...
we are going to start working with him ... with the aim of having a substantial response next week , " she told afp . iran is facing mounting international pressure to show by next week that it is ready to accept the offer , with the threat of un security council action hanging over it . but iran , which denies it is trying to covertly build an atomic bomb behind the screen of a civilian nuclear programme , refuses categorically to suspend enrichment activities ; a key condition of the package . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice says the us is still waiting for iran to move on their offer " we still intend to have a substantive response from iran before the middle of july ... , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said wednesday .
" it simply makes sense for the world to have some kind of indication of whether iran intends to pursue the negotiated track or not . " another meeting on iran leaders of the group of eight major industrial powers expect to examine iran 's response at a meeting in saint petersburg starting on july 15 , but , as in the past , iran has resisted all attempts to set a calendar . on wednesday , larijani tried to push back the brussels talks until next week , but solana said that " waiting another week was impossible " and " there had to be a contact before that " , according to gallach . thursday evening 's dinner comes ahead of more substantial talks in paris next tuesday , when representatives from the five permanent un security council members plus germany are expected to meet solana but not the iranian delegation , according to the eu diplomat 's office . the us state department also said that foreign ministers from the six world powers would meet to discuss iran the following day - wednesday - just before the g8 summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in the central iranian city of isfahan in their offer , the six affirm iran 's right to develop nuclear energy , support its building of light-water reactors and provide for uranium enrichment to take place in russia . it would improve tehran 's access to international markets and capital and back its efforts to join the world trade organisation , among other incentives . in return , iran would suspend all enrichment-related activities , which have sparked fears it may be trying to build a nuclear weapon , and accept wider inspections by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran dragging its feet over nuclear talks the eu is pressuring iran to accept a " very good package of incentives " in exchange for halting uranium enrichment before the g8 meeting of industrial nations on july 15 .

he also said he 'd move over for oliver kahn in saturday 's match for third place . after his first major tournament in net for germany , lehmann said whether he stays with the national team until euro 2008 largely depends on klinsmann continuing to coach the young team he put together for the 2006 world cup . it was klinsmann who chose to start lehmann over former germany captain kahn .
lehmann impressed many with his performance between the posts during the tournament though he did n't have a chance of stopping the italian goals that sent germany out in the semi-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and the german team want klinsmann to stay on " i will think about my personal situation after the finals and certainly chat with jürgen klinsmann about it , " the 36-year-old told reporters on thursday , adding that he would like klinsmann to stay .
" if jürgen decides that he does not want to continue , the disappointment would be enormous as we do not know what is coming next . " lehmann , who looked slightly despondent at the press conference , admitted he was finding the italy defeat hard to swallow . " the disappointment of going so close to winning two major trophies this season will stay with me for a long time , " he said , referring to losing the champions league with his club team , arsenal , before reaching the final .
" as a player it is difficult to stomach missing out on the final . " making way for king kahn missing out on the final was likely to have been equally difficult for former germany starter kahn , who has n't played at all during the 2006 tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn earned respect from germany for his sportsmanship during the world cup the 37-year-old ended up on the short end of an extended duel with lehmann for the number 1 spot , but may get a chance to say goodbye to international soccer by starting in saturday 's match for third place against portugal . " if oliver wants to play and the coach is convinced then that would be fine by me , " lehmann said .
" he has been the model professional and worked hard in training .
he has been a great example and has definitely earned it . " kahn , known for his egotistical and often arrogant outbursts on and off the field , earned the respect of much of germany by embracing lehmann in a show of support before a quarter-final penalty shoot-out against argentina , in which lehmann blocked two shots . " jens ' performance is absolutely flawless , " kahn said during the tournament .

the winning entry came from a couple in new york city for their song , " the streets of berlin .

" i thought , they 're going to hate this idea , they do n't want a song " she said with a grimace .
" and then when we did end up submitting a song whose first lines talked about the grey berlin sky , i did n't think we had a chance . " the two new york city residents are telling this story from the deutsche welle offices in berlin , where they 've come as the contest 's grand-prize winners .
their song , which relates some of holly 's fond memories of her year spent in the german capital , beat hundreds of other entries sent in from around the globe . both holly , 33 , and david , 34 , consider themselves germanophiles , something holly said in her case developed long before she knew there was a name for it .
her best childhood friend had german parents , and as she grew older , she found she was attracted to german music , poetry and literature .

holly , who does pr for the michael j. fox foundation , is a classically trained singer , and the two had been recording music in their apartment , mostly jazz standards , for several years . after holly agreed to the song idea , david wrote the guitar part and asked holly to write about berlin , where she 'd lived in the prenzlauer berg district from the summer of 1999 to the fall of 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tv tower , featured in the winning song " i fell in love with the energy of the place and i felt it was a time rich with possibilities , " she said .

the winning entry came from a couple in new york city for their song , " the streets of berlin . " when david barkhymer suggested to his wife holly that they submit a song for the deutsche welle contest he 'd recently seen announced on the web site , she was more than a little skeptical . " i thought , they 're going to hate this idea , they do n't want a song " she said with a grimace .
" and then when we did end up submitting a song whose first lines talked about the grey berlin sky , i did n't think we had a chance . " the two new york city residents are telling this story from the deutsche welle offices in berlin , where they 've come as the contest 's grand-prize winners .
their song , which relates some of holly 's fond memories of her year spent in the german capital , beat hundreds of other entries sent in from around the globe . both holly , 33 , and david , 34 , consider themselves germanophiles , something holly said in her case developed long before she knew there was a name for it .
her best childhood friend had german parents , and as she grew older , she found she was attracted to german music , poetry and literature .
as she got to know contemporary germany better , she began to appreciate many aspects of life here . " i like germans ' concern for the environment and the country 's social safety net , " she said .
" and while you ca n't paint with too broad a brush , i think germans are a people who generally think things through .
it 's a pretty good place . " in a way , she has germany to thank for meeting her husband david , who also has a soft-spot for german movies , bands and soccer .
the two first met in a nightclub because david was wearing a shirt with the word polizei -lrb- police -rrb- on it .
that sparked holly 's interest and she struck up a conversation .
the two were married last october . city tour , sung to david , a special education teacher who plays guitar and bass , writing a song for the deutsche welle contest seemed like a natural for the couple .
holly , who does pr for the michael j. fox foundation , is a classically trained singer , and the two had been recording music in their apartment , mostly jazz standards , for several years . after holly agreed to the song idea , david wrote the guitar part and asked holly to write about berlin , where she 'd lived in the prenzlauer berg district from the summer of 1999 to the fall of 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tv tower , featured in the winning song " i fell in love with the energy of the place and i felt it was a time rich with possibilities , " she said .
" i was far from home and wanted to try things out . " their song is akin to a walk holly might have taken around the city then , listing off her favorite places : kreuzberg , the babylon cinema , the tiergarten park or iconic fernsehturm -lrb- tv tower -rrb- . while she does mention berlin 's heavy grey skies in her lyrics , she left out some other aspects that were difficult for her here , such as the notorious brusque manner of many native berliners .
" there were a few times back then when i was in tears , " she said . sites to see she and david said they were were thrilled to learn that deutsche welle was flying them to berlin for a week and plan to pack as much into their trip as possible .
they stayed with david 's brother , who teaches in wiesbaden , for a few days , where they were crushed by germany 's defeat by the italians in the world cup semi-finals .
now , they appear to have mostly bounced back , and want to hit as many sites in the capital as they can before flying home on sunday . one thing on the schedule is time spent in the beer gardens , where they plan on drinking their fair share of german beer ..
while they say new york city has everything , there are some things even the big apple ca n't guarantee 100 percent of the time . " when i was here , i could just go to any place around the corner and ask for a beer , " said holly .
" i would n't even know what i was getting , but i knew it 'd be delicious .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.07.2006 singing berlin 's praises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holly and david barkhymer , contest winners in the run-up to the world cup , deutsche welle held a contest asking people to share their impressions of germany .
the winning entry came from a couple in new york city for their song , " the streets of berlin . " when david barkhymer suggested to his wife holly that they submit a song for the deutsche welle contest he 'd recently seen announced on the web site , she was more than a little skeptical . " i thought , they 're going to hate this idea , they do n't want a song " she said with a grimace .
" and then when we did end up submitting a song whose first lines talked about the grey berlin sky , i did n't think we had a chance . " the two new york city residents are telling this story from the deutsche welle offices in berlin , where they 've come as the contest 's grand-prize winners .
their song , which relates some of holly 's fond memories of her year spent in the german capital , beat hundreds of other entries sent in from around the globe . both holly , 33 , and david , 34 , consider themselves germanophiles , something holly said in her case developed long before she knew there was a name for it .
her best childhood friend had german parents , and as she grew older , she found she was attracted to german music , poetry and literature .
as she got to know contemporary germany better , she began to appreciate many aspects of life here . " i like germans ' concern for the environment and the country 's social safety net , " she said .
" and while you ca n't paint with too broad a brush , i think germans are a people who generally think things through .
it 's a pretty good place . " in a way , she has germany to thank for meeting her husband david , who also has a soft-spot for german movies , bands and soccer .
the two first met in a nightclub because david was wearing a shirt with the word polizei -lrb- police -rrb- on it .
that sparked holly 's interest and she struck up a conversation .
the two were married last october . city tour , sung to david , a special education teacher who plays guitar and bass , writing a song for the deutsche welle contest seemed like a natural for the couple .
holly , who does pr for the michael j. fox foundation , is a classically trained singer , and the two had been recording music in their apartment , mostly jazz standards , for several years . after holly agreed to the song idea , david wrote the guitar part and asked holly to write about berlin , where she 'd lived in the prenzlauer berg district from the summer of 1999 to the fall of 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tv tower , featured in the winning song " i fell in love with the energy of the place and i felt it was a time rich with possibilities , " she said .
" i was far from home and wanted to try things out . " their song is akin to a walk holly might have taken around the city then , listing off her favorite places : kreuzberg , the babylon cinema , the tiergarten park or iconic fernsehturm -lrb- tv tower -rrb- . while she does mention berlin 's heavy grey skies in her lyrics , she left out some other aspects that were difficult for her here , such as the notorious brusque manner of many native berliners .
" there were a few times back then when i was in tears , " she said . sites to see she and david said they were were thrilled to learn that deutsche welle was flying them to berlin for a week and plan to pack as much into their trip as possible .
they stayed with david 's brother , who teaches in wiesbaden , for a few days , where they were crushed by germany 's defeat by the italians in the world cup semi-finals .

the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .
in fact , after they leave school , only about one-half of them have the qualifications to begin an apprenticeship program . " the economy is the most important integration mechanism we have , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
" that 's why i ask that we take our responsibility in creating enough apprenticeships for young people very seriously , even in lower-skilled professions . " low-wage expansion according to him , the majority of young people with immigrant backgrounds will enter professions that are not in the highly skilled sector , but in sectors that require less training .
that is why he has called for reform in the country 's low-wage sector , since he says without the creation of additional jobs in this area , the threat of illegal work will only grow . still , creating more low-wage jobs runs contrary to what the economy is looking for in the future .
otto kenzler , present of the german confederation of skills crafts , says both industry and young people must be involved in bringing more skilled labor into the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people should start looking for trainee spots early " i can only advise young people to get in contact with companies early on , even during their time at school , " he said .
" the fact that they have a goal in front of them and a chance at an apprenticeship has help them considerably . " foreign-owned businesses just under 24 percent of german companies offer training program for young people , although only 15 percent of those companies with owners of foreign origin do .
that should change , according to nihat sorgec , director of the kreuzberg educational works , who works with many business owned by people of turkish origin . " in the meanwhile , there are more than 60,000 businesspeople of turkish origin in germany .
they employ more than 320,000 people and have annual sales of over 30 billion euros , " he said .
" according to estimates , that number will double in the next 10 to 15 years . " but statistics such as these are n't enough to meet the problem of a future lack of qualified personnel , according to dieter hundt .
he has called for a change in germany 's immigration policy .
he 'd like , for example , to link immigration to germany to qualifications such as education , work experience and language ability . " a rational immigration policy that is oriented toward the needs of the labor market can do a lot for overall economic dynamism and job creation , " he said . that is an opinion that the head of the munich-based institute of economic research , hans-werner sinn , shares .

" we have so far not seen any marked increase in human trafficking from eastern european countries to germany during the world cup , " swedish iom spokesman fredric larsson told the afp news agency . german police confirmed that prostitution , which has been legal in germany since 2002 , did not rise considerably during the month-long soccer tournament . " before the world cup there were rumors circulating about a large rush of prostitutes , " cologne city spokesman jürgen müllenberg said .
" but neither legal nor illegal prostitution has significantly risen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans have n't had time to visit brothels passion saved for the pitch the millions of soccer fans who descended on germany have saved their passion for the action on the field rather than in brothels . " the world cup is a major party that 's rolling through the country , but fans have neither the money nor time to pay for sex , " said stephanie klee of the german association of sexual services , a group that lobbies for sex workers ' rights . she added that a number of prostitutes decided to go on vacation during the soccer tournament . " it 's going pretty slowly , unfortunately , " sabine strauss told the dpa news agency .
she runs an internet site where women can offer their services . munich , where 300 prostitutes joined the 500 already working there , was the only german city to register an increase during the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign to end forced prostitution has been successful anti-trafficking campaigns worked larsson put strauss 's lack of business down to the success of a large-scale campaign to raise awareness of trafficking and forced prostitution before the world cup began . " the campaign has had a positive effect , " he said .
" it shows we do not need to accept trafficking . " pressure from the european union , united states and church groups led to more police raids on sex shops and brothels , which also helped keep legal and illegal prostitution down , according to the report . the preliminary study 's results were based on reports from european police as well as over 20 organizations that work against human trafficking in germany and eastern europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.07.2006 germany industry calls for reform of immigration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more highly qualified labor , but many immigrants do n't have the skills .
the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .
in fact , after they leave school , only about one-half of them have the qualifications to begin an apprenticeship program . " the economy is the most important integration mechanism we have , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
" that 's why i ask that we take our responsibility in creating enough apprenticeships for young people very seriously , even in lower-skilled professions . " low-wage expansion according to him , the majority of young people with immigrant backgrounds will enter professions that are not in the highly skilled sector , but in sectors that require less training .
that is why he has called for reform in the country 's low-wage sector , since he says without the creation of additional jobs in this area , the threat of illegal work will only grow . still , creating more low-wage jobs runs contrary to what the economy is looking for in the future .
otto kenzler , present of the german confederation of skills crafts , says both industry and young people must be involved in bringing more skilled labor into the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people should start looking for trainee spots early " i can only advise young people to get in contact with companies early on , even during their time at school , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.07.2006 germany industry calls for reform of immigration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more highly qualified labor , but many immigrants do n't have the skills .
the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .
in fact , after they leave school , only about one-half of them have the qualifications to begin an apprenticeship program . " the economy is the most important integration mechanism we have , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
" that 's why i ask that we take our responsibility in creating enough apprenticeships for young people very seriously , even in lower-skilled professions . " low-wage expansion according to him , the majority of young people with immigrant backgrounds will enter professions that are not in the highly skilled sector , but in sectors that require less training .
that is why he has called for reform in the country 's low-wage sector , since he says without the creation of additional jobs in this area , the threat of illegal work will only grow . still , creating more low-wage jobs runs contrary to what the economy is looking for in the future .
otto kenzler , present of the german confederation of skills crafts , says both industry and young people must be involved in bringing more skilled labor into the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people should start looking for trainee spots early " i can only advise young people to get in contact with companies early on , even during their time at school , " he said .
" the fact that they have a goal in front of them and a chance at an apprenticeship has help them considerably . " foreign-owned businesses just under 24 percent of german companies offer training program for young people , although only 15 percent of those companies with owners of foreign origin do .
that should change , according to nihat sorgec , director of the kreuzberg educational works , who works with many business owned by people of turkish origin . " in the meanwhile , there are more than 60,000 businesspeople of turkish origin in germany .

the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .
in fact , after they leave school , only about one-half of them have the qualifications to begin an apprenticeship program . " the economy is the most important integration mechanism we have , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
" that 's why i ask that we take our responsibility in creating enough apprenticeships for young people very seriously , even in lower-skilled professions . " low-wage expansion according to him , the majority of young people with immigrant backgrounds will enter professions that are not in the highly skilled sector , but in sectors that require less training .
that is why he has called for reform in the country 's low-wage sector , since he says without the creation of additional jobs in this area , the threat of illegal work will only grow . still , creating more low-wage jobs runs contrary to what the economy is looking for in the future .
otto kenzler , present of the german confederation of skills crafts , says both industry and young people must be involved in bringing more skilled labor into the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people should start looking for trainee spots early " i can only advise young people to get in contact with companies early on , even during their time at school , " he said .
" the fact that they have a goal in front of them and a chance at an apprenticeship has help them considerably . " foreign-owned businesses just under 24 percent of german companies offer training program for young people , although only 15 percent of those companies with owners of foreign origin do .
that should change , according to nihat sorgec , director of the kreuzberg educational works , who works with many business owned by people of turkish origin . " in the meanwhile , there are more than 60,000 businesspeople of turkish origin in germany .
they employ more than 320,000 people and have annual sales of over 30 billion euros , " he said .
" according to estimates , that number will double in the next 10 to 15 years . " but statistics such as these are n't enough to meet the problem of a future lack of qualified personnel , according to dieter hundt .
he has called for a change in germany 's immigration policy .
he 'd like , for example , to link immigration to germany to qualifications such as education , work experience and language ability . " a rational immigration policy that is oriented toward the needs of the labor market can do a lot for overall economic dynamism and job creation , " he said . that is an opinion that the head of the munich-based institute of economic research , hans-werner sinn , shares .
germany has to condition itself for large-scale immigration , he says , since without immigrants , germany has little chance keeping its spot as one of the biggest economies in the world . sabine kinkartz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the low-pay way to reenter the job market one of germany 's controversial welfare reforms included one-euro jobs , designed to reintegrate the jobless into the labor market .

the german parliament agreed this week not only to extend the anti-terror laws passed in early 2001 , but to make them more stringent .
advocates of civil liberties are outraged . in the wake of september 11 , german law makers passed a series of anti-terror laws that are due to expire at the end of the year .
this week , germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats agreed on proposals that would not only extend the controversial laws but make them even tougher . " so far , scans of information databases have only been allowed in connection with terror suspects , " explained stefan kalle , spokesman for the ministry of the interior .
" it is now planned to extend this to include rightwing extremists and militant islamists such as hate preachers operating in germany .

he may , in fact , end up leaving the country thinking germany is n't so different from texas , after all . having george w. bush come over for a visit is an incredibly stressful affair for any foreign government official . first of all , there 's the issue of the president 's tough cowboy talk which usually makes most foreigners - even the occasionally overeducated head of state - rather insecure about their knowledge of english . when george dubya pronounces " america , " for example , it usually comes out as " amur-cah " or " mur-cah . "
that 's a little strange for somebody who grew up in midland , texas , but left it at the age of 15 to follow the typical path of a member of the lucky sperm club : prep school at andover , college at yale and graduate school at harvard .
george w. proudly uses his theatrical texan twang - not shared by his parents or siblings - to declare his chosen identity .

" we have so far not seen any marked increase in human trafficking from eastern european countries to germany during the world cup , " swedish iom spokesman fredric larsson told the afp news agency . german police confirmed that prostitution , which has been legal in germany since 2002 , did not rise considerably during the month-long soccer tournament . " before the world cup there were rumors circulating about a large rush of prostitutes , " cologne city spokesman jürgen müllenberg said .
" but neither legal nor illegal prostitution has significantly risen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans have n't had time to visit brothels passion saved for the pitch the millions of soccer fans who descended on germany have saved their passion for the action on the field rather than in brothels . " the world cup is a major party that 's rolling through the country , but fans have neither the money nor time to pay for sex , " said stephanie klee of the german association of sexual services , a group that lobbies for sex workers ' rights . she added that a number of prostitutes decided to go on vacation during the soccer tournament . " it 's going pretty slowly , unfortunately , " sabine strauss told the dpa news agency .
she runs an internet site where women can offer their services . munich , where 300 prostitutes joined the 500 already working there , was the only german city to register an increase during the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign to end forced prostitution has been successful anti-trafficking campaigns worked larsson put strauss 's lack of business down to the success of a large-scale campaign to raise awareness of trafficking and forced prostitution before the world cup began . " the campaign has had a positive effect , " he said .
" it shows we do not need to accept trafficking .

the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .
in fact , after they leave school , only about one-half of them have the qualifications to begin an apprenticeship program . " the economy is the most important integration mechanism we have , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
" that 's why i ask that we take our responsibility in creating enough apprenticeships for young people very seriously , even in lower-skilled professions . " low-wage expansion according to him , the majority of young people with immigrant backgrounds will enter professions that are not in the highly skilled sector , but in sectors that require less training .
that is why he has called for reform in the country 's low-wage sector , since he says without the creation of additional jobs in this area , the threat of illegal work will only grow . still , creating more low-wage jobs runs contrary to what the economy is looking for in the future .
otto kenzler , present of the german confederation of skills crafts , says both industry and young people must be involved in bringing more skilled labor into the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people should start looking for trainee spots early " i can only advise young people to get in contact with companies early on , even during their time at school , " he said .
" the fact that they have a goal in front of them and a chance at an apprenticeship has help them considerably . " foreign-owned businesses just under 24 percent of german companies offer training program for young people , although only 15 percent of those companies with owners of foreign origin do .
that should change , according to nihat sorgec , director of the kreuzberg educational works , who works with many business owned by people of turkish origin . " in the meanwhile , there are more than 60,000 businesspeople of turkish origin in germany .
they employ more than 320,000 people and have annual sales of over 30 billion euros , " he said .
" according to estimates , that number will double in the next 10 to 15 years . " but statistics such as these are n't enough to meet the problem of a future lack of qualified personnel , according to dieter hundt .
he has called for a change in germany 's immigration policy .
he 'd like , for example , to link immigration to germany to qualifications such as education , work experience and language ability . " a rational immigration policy that is oriented toward the needs of the labor market can do a lot for overall economic dynamism and job creation , " he said . that is an opinion that the head of the munich-based institute of economic research , hans-werner sinn , shares .

" we have so far not seen any marked increase in human trafficking from eastern european countries to germany during the world cup , " swedish iom spokesman fredric larsson told the afp news agency . german police confirmed that prostitution , which has been legal in germany since 2002 , did not rise considerably during the month-long soccer tournament . " before the world cup there were rumors circulating about a large rush of prostitutes , " cologne city spokesman jürgen müllenberg said .

" it 's going pretty slowly , unfortunately , " sabine strauss told the dpa news agency .
she runs an internet site where women can offer their services . munich , where 300 prostitutes joined the 500 already working there , was the only german city to register an increase during the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign to end forced prostitution has been successful anti-trafficking campaigns worked larsson put strauss 's lack of business down to the success of a large-scale campaign to raise awareness of trafficking and forced prostitution before the world cup began . " the campaign has had a positive effect , " he said .
" it shows we do not need to accept trafficking . " pressure from the european union , united states and church groups led to more police raids on sex shops and brothels , which also helped keep legal and illegal prostitution down , according to the report . the preliminary study 's results were based on reports from european police as well as over 20 organizations that work against human trafficking in germany and eastern europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.07.2006 germany industry calls for reform of immigration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more highly qualified labor , but many immigrants do n't have the skills .
the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future .

" he has been the model professional and worked hard in training .
he has been a great example and has definitely earned it .

the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .
in fact , after they leave school , only about one-half of them have the qualifications to begin an apprenticeship program . " the economy is the most important integration mechanism we have , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
" that 's why i ask that we take our responsibility in creating enough apprenticeships for young people very seriously , even in lower-skilled professions . " low-wage expansion according to him , the majority of young people with immigrant backgrounds will enter professions that are not in the highly skilled sector , but in sectors that require less training .
that is why he has called for reform in the country 's low-wage sector , since he says without the creation of additional jobs in this area , the threat of illegal work will only grow . still , creating more low-wage jobs runs contrary to what the economy is looking for in the future .
otto kenzler , present of the german confederation of skills crafts , says both industry and young people must be involved in bringing more skilled labor into the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people should start looking for trainee spots early " i can only advise young people to get in contact with companies early on , even during their time at school , " he said .
" the fact that they have a goal in front of them and a chance at an apprenticeship has help them considerably . " foreign-owned businesses just under 24 percent of german companies offer training program for young people , although only 15 percent of those companies with owners of foreign origin do .
that should change , according to nihat sorgec , director of the kreuzberg educational works , who works with many business owned by people of turkish origin . " in the meanwhile , there are more than 60,000 businesspeople of turkish origin in germany .
they employ more than 320,000 people and have annual sales of over 30 billion euros , " he said .
" according to estimates , that number will double in the next 10 to 15 years . " but statistics such as these are n't enough to meet the problem of a future lack of qualified personnel , according to dieter hundt .
he has called for a change in germany 's immigration policy .
he 'd like , for example , to link immigration to germany to qualifications such as education , work experience and language ability . " a rational immigration policy that is oriented toward the needs of the labor market can do a lot for overall economic dynamism and job creation , " he said . that is an opinion that the head of the munich-based institute of economic research , hans-werner sinn , shares .
germany has to condition itself for large-scale immigration , he says , since without immigrants , germany has little chance keeping its spot as one of the biggest economies in the world . sabine kinkartz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the low-pay way to reenter the job market one of germany 's controversial welfare reforms included one-euro jobs , designed to reintegrate the jobless into the labor market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.07.2006 germany industry calls for reform of immigration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more highly qualified labor , but many immigrants do n't have the skills .
the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .

the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .
in fact , after they leave school , only about one-half of them have the qualifications to begin an apprenticeship program . " the economy is the most important integration mechanism we have , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .

" we have so far not seen any marked increase in human trafficking from eastern european countries to germany during the world cup , " swedish iom spokesman fredric larsson told the afp news agency . german police confirmed that prostitution , which has been legal in germany since 2002 , did not rise considerably during the month-long soccer tournament . " before the world cup there were rumors circulating about a large rush of prostitutes , " cologne city spokesman jürgen müllenberg said .
" but neither legal nor illegal prostitution has significantly risen .

" it 's going pretty slowly , unfortunately , " sabine strauss told the dpa news agency .
she runs an internet site where women can offer their services . munich , where 300 prostitutes joined the 500 already working there , was the only german city to register an increase during the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign to end forced prostitution has been successful anti-trafficking campaigns worked larsson put strauss 's lack of business down to the success of a large-scale campaign to raise awareness of trafficking and forced prostitution before the world cup began . " the campaign has had a positive effect , " he said .
" it shows we do not need to accept trafficking . " pressure from the european union , united states and church groups led to more police raids on sex shops and brothels , which also helped keep legal and illegal prostitution down , according to the report . the preliminary study 's results were based on reports from european police as well as over 20 organizations that work against human trafficking in germany and eastern europe .

hey , condi , where did all the people go ? angie and george bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stralsund is known for its architecture on july 13 and 14 , german chancellor angela merkel will be the overstressed host trying to keep her composure when she welcomes george w. and first lady laura bush at her constituency , stralsund - a beautiful historic sea town of 60,000 in the north-eastern part of the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . during all the handshaking , the smiling and the joking that usually goes on in front of the journalists when the american president is around , members of the association " not welcome , mr. president " will be staging their protest on the outskirts of stralsund .
the downtown historic district , where bush will be hanging out , has been declared a no-protest zone . " in our talks with the police and the city , we will try to make sure we get as close as possible , both in terms of the location and the time , to the events , " said monty schädel , one of the protest organizers . ladies first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura bush will practically have nothing to do according to officials in berlin , a small special " damenprogramm " -lrb- program for ladies -rrb- has been planned for laura bush , but no details are available yet .
which is quite understandable : berlin officials in charge of the protocol are probably banging their heads against the walls of the chancellery right now .
" where , oh where , are we going to send her ? " they ask themselves . the town will be , after all , completely paralyzed during the visit .
municipal agencies and offices will be closed .
no shops will be open .
entering the town 's historic central district will be possible only through one of two check points .
the library , the museum , the adult education center and the music school will also close their doors .
stralsunders who live in the historic district will not be allowed to open their windows or leave their apartments from 9:30 am until 16 minutes after the end of the visit . laura bush may end up having no choice but to sit around and twiddle her thumbs while george w. and angela merkel hold their talks . hunting for the president despite the planned protests , some stralsunders are actually looking forward to the presidential visit .
stralsund 's hotel royal , for example , is throwing an american barbecue party the night before bush 's arrival with country music and cowboy dancers . " the visit of the most powerful politician is a huge boost for the image of stralsund , " said hotel manager sebastian tacke .
" that has to be celebrated accordingly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : please , do n't shoot !
merkel and the bushes will themselves attend a different barbecue , one hosted by olaf micheel , an innkeeper from neighboring trinwillershagen .
in a bow to the manly , alpha-animal texan , micheel is planning to roast a wild boar that he has shot himself .
the only problem is that he has n't found one yet .
but he 's out there with a gun , looking .
a local radio station is dutifully following the hunt for the president 's boar . " we could never pay for this kind of advertising , " said micheel .
" this is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity . " micheel is convinced that the american president will feel at home in his tiny village between stralsund and rostock . " it 's like being on a ranch here , " micheel said . tastes like fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's something really fishy about traditional german recipes the local fishmonger henry rasmus will present the american president with a box of bismarck herring - the only fish in the world officially allowed to carry the noble name of germany 's greatest 19th century statesman .
rasmus bought the rights to the original recipe for marinated herring from the descendants of johann wiechmann , who served it first in 1871 to the mighty otto von bismarck , the iron chancellor . when all is said and done , angela merkel will probably breathe a sigh of relief to see george dubya 's back .
though she may get a slight headache arguing with the local government of mecklenburg - western pomerania about who 's going to foot the 12 million euro -lrb- $ 14.3 million -rrb- bill to cover the expenses of the us president 's visit . which is , if you think about it , quite pricey for two days of pure stress and a wild boar barbecue . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in greifswald , lady liberty lifts a finger what happens when a high-level diplomatic visit clashes with a politically charged musical production ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 06.07.2006 feared surge in world cup prostitution proves unfounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's brothels have n't seen more business during the world cup criticized for not taking the problem of sex trade trafficking seriously enough , a new report shows there has been no marked increase in human trafficking related to the sex trade during the world cup . the predictions that as many as 40,000 women would be forced to work as prostitutes during the world cup did not materialize , according to a report released tuesday by the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- and the swedish development agency sida . " we have so far not seen any marked increase in human trafficking from eastern european countries to germany during the world cup , " swedish iom spokesman fredric larsson told the afp news agency . german police confirmed that prostitution , which has been legal in germany since 2002 , did not rise considerably during the month-long soccer tournament . " before the world cup there were rumors circulating about a large rush of prostitutes , " cologne city spokesman jürgen müllenberg said .
" but neither legal nor illegal prostitution has significantly risen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans have n't had time to visit brothels passion saved for the pitch the millions of soccer fans who descended on germany have saved their passion for the action on the field rather than in brothels . " the world cup is a major party that 's rolling through the country , but fans have neither the money nor time to pay for sex , " said stephanie klee of the german association of sexual services , a group that lobbies for sex workers ' rights . she added that a number of prostitutes decided to go on vacation during the soccer tournament . " it 's going pretty slowly , unfortunately , " sabine strauss told the dpa news agency .
she runs an internet site where women can offer their services . munich , where 300 prostitutes joined the 500 already working there , was the only german city to register an increase during the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign to end forced prostitution has been successful anti-trafficking campaigns worked larsson put strauss 's lack of business down to the success of a large-scale campaign to raise awareness of trafficking and forced prostitution before the world cup began . " the campaign has had a positive effect , " he said .
" it shows we do not need to accept trafficking . " pressure from the european union , united states and church groups led to more police raids on sex shops and brothels , which also helped keep legal and illegal prostitution down , according to the report . the preliminary study 's results were based on reports from european police as well as over 20 organizations that work against human trafficking in germany and eastern europe .
the complete report is expected to be released in september . the iom estimates that some 200,000 people are trafficked into and within europe every year , the majority of them women and girls for sexual exploitation . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de increasing concern over human trafficking in germany the modern slave trade is estimated to be worth $ 35 billion a year - the german institute for human rights says only drugs and arms are more lucrative .

" we will not give a response , " either wednesday evening or next tuesday , at a wider meeting of iranian officials with representatives of countries behind the international nuclear offer , the official told news agency afp .
" we are just resolving ambiguities " of the package of incentives being offered to the islamic republic , he added . leaders still hope iran will budge solana has said he expects a " first response " in the brussels talks on whether iran might be ready to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for political and economic incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad still remains defiant but iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said that tehran will give its formal response to the offer in august . russian president vladimir putin called thursday for tehran to accelerate its efforts to respond to the international community .
" the iranian leadership said it is ready for dialogue and will answer by august , " putin said while answering questions sent in by internet from around the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.07.2006 germany industry calls for reform of immigration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more highly qualified labor , but many immigrants do n't have the skills .
the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .

the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .
in fact , after they leave school , only about one-half of them have the qualifications to begin an apprenticeship program . " the economy is the most important integration mechanism we have , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .

" we have so far not seen any marked increase in human trafficking from eastern european countries to germany during the world cup , " swedish iom spokesman fredric larsson told the afp news agency . german police confirmed that prostitution , which has been legal in germany since 2002 , did not rise considerably during the month-long soccer tournament . " before the world cup there were rumors circulating about a large rush of prostitutes , " cologne city spokesman jürgen müllenberg said .
" but neither legal nor illegal prostitution has significantly risen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans have n't had time to visit brothels passion saved for the pitch the millions of soccer fans who descended on germany have saved their passion for the action on the field rather than in brothels . " the world cup is a major party that 's rolling through the country , but fans have neither the money nor time to pay for sex , " said stephanie klee of the german association of sexual services , a group that lobbies for sex workers ' rights . she added that a number of prostitutes decided to go on vacation during the soccer tournament . " it 's going pretty slowly , unfortunately , " sabine strauss told the dpa news agency .
she runs an internet site where women can offer their services . munich , where 300 prostitutes joined the 500 already working there , was the only german city to register an increase during the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign to end forced prostitution has been successful anti-trafficking campaigns worked larsson put strauss 's lack of business down to the success of a large-scale campaign to raise awareness of trafficking and forced prostitution before the world cup began . " the campaign has had a positive effect , " he said .
" it shows we do not need to accept trafficking .

the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .
in fact , after they leave school , only about one-half of them have the qualifications to begin an apprenticeship program . " the economy is the most important integration mechanism we have , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
" that 's why i ask that we take our responsibility in creating enough apprenticeships for young people very seriously , even in lower-skilled professions . " low-wage expansion according to him , the majority of young people with immigrant backgrounds will enter professions that are not in the highly skilled sector , but in sectors that require less training .
that is why he has called for reform in the country 's low-wage sector , since he says without the creation of additional jobs in this area , the threat of illegal work will only grow . still , creating more low-wage jobs runs contrary to what the economy is looking for in the future .
otto kenzler , present of the german confederation of skills crafts , says both industry and young people must be involved in bringing more skilled labor into the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people should start looking for trainee spots early " i can only advise young people to get in contact with companies early on , even during their time at school , " he said .
" the fact that they have a goal in front of them and a chance at an apprenticeship has help them considerably . " foreign-owned businesses just under 24 percent of german companies offer training program for young people , although only 15 percent of those companies with owners of foreign origin do .
that should change , according to nihat sorgec , director of the kreuzberg educational works , who works with many business owned by people of turkish origin . " in the meanwhile , there are more than 60,000 businesspeople of turkish origin in germany .
they employ more than 320,000 people and have annual sales of over 30 billion euros , " he said .
" according to estimates , that number will double in the next 10 to 15 years . " but statistics such as these are n't enough to meet the problem of a future lack of qualified personnel , according to dieter hundt .
he has called for a change in germany 's immigration policy .
he 'd like , for example , to link immigration to germany to qualifications such as education , work experience and language ability . " a rational immigration policy that is oriented toward the needs of the labor market can do a lot for overall economic dynamism and job creation , " he said . that is an opinion that the head of the munich-based institute of economic research , hans-werner sinn , shares .
germany has to condition itself for large-scale immigration , he says , since without immigrants , germany has little chance keeping its spot as one of the biggest economies in the world . sabine kinkartz -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the low-pay way to reenter the job market one of germany 's controversial welfare reforms included one-euro jobs , designed to reintegrate the jobless into the labor market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 06.07.2006 wild boar barbecue for mr. & mrs. bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she thinks he 's funny : german chancellor angela merkel and us president george w. bush when george w. bush comes to germany next week , he 'll get to enjoy , among other things , a wild boar barbecue .
he may , in fact , end up leaving the country thinking germany is n't so different from texas , after all . having george w. bush come over for a visit is an incredibly stressful affair for any foreign government official . first of all , there 's the issue of the president 's tough cowboy talk which usually makes most foreigners - even the occasionally overeducated head of state - rather insecure about their knowledge of english . when george dubya pronounces " america , " for example , it usually comes out as " amur-cah " or " mur-cah . "
that 's a little strange for somebody who grew up in midland , texas , but left it at the age of 15 to follow the typical path of a member of the lucky sperm club : prep school at andover , college at yale and graduate school at harvard .
george w. proudly uses his theatrical texan twang - not shared by his parents or siblings - to declare his chosen identity .
it is like his own pair of stylish cowboy boots that nobody will ever be able to rob him of . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are big fans of the us president then , there is the ever-embarrassing issue of the tireless , bush-whacking protestors .
luckily for the stressed-out hosts , the police usually sequester the demonstrators as far away from the us president as possible : see-no-evil , hear-no-evil is the best way to avoid embarrassment while playing the usual round of diplomatic charades and stressing improved bilateral relations .
as a consequence , mr. bush probably thinks that european cities are kind of lonely .
hey , condi , where did all the people go ? angie and george bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stralsund is known for its architecture on july 13 and 14 , german chancellor angela merkel will be the overstressed host trying to keep her composure when she welcomes george w. and first lady laura bush at her constituency , stralsund - a beautiful historic sea town of 60,000 in the north-eastern part of the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . during all the handshaking , the smiling and the joking that usually goes on in front of the journalists when the american president is around , members of the association " not welcome , mr. president " will be staging their protest on the outskirts of stralsund .
the downtown historic district , where bush will be hanging out , has been declared a no-protest zone . " in our talks with the police and the city , we will try to make sure we get as close as possible , both in terms of the location and the time , to the events , " said monty schädel , one of the protest organizers . ladies first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura bush will practically have nothing to do according to officials in berlin , a small special " damenprogramm " -lrb- program for ladies -rrb- has been planned for laura bush , but no details are available yet .
which is quite understandable : berlin officials in charge of the protocol are probably banging their heads against the walls of the chancellery right now .
" where , oh where , are we going to send her ? " they ask themselves . the town will be , after all , completely paralyzed during the visit .
municipal agencies and offices will be closed .
no shops will be open .
entering the town 's historic central district will be possible only through one of two check points .
the library , the museum , the adult education center and the music school will also close their doors .
stralsunders who live in the historic district will not be allowed to open their windows or leave their apartments from 9:30 am until 16 minutes after the end of the visit . laura bush may end up having no choice but to sit around and twiddle her thumbs while george w. and angela merkel hold their talks . hunting for the president despite the planned protests , some stralsunders are actually looking forward to the presidential visit .
stralsund 's hotel royal , for example , is throwing an american barbecue party the night before bush 's arrival with country music and cowboy dancers . " the visit of the most powerful politician is a huge boost for the image of stralsund , " said hotel manager sebastian tacke .
" that has to be celebrated accordingly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : please , do n't shoot !
merkel and the bushes will themselves attend a different barbecue , one hosted by olaf micheel , an innkeeper from neighboring trinwillershagen .
in a bow to the manly , alpha-animal texan , micheel is planning to roast a wild boar that he has shot himself .
the only problem is that he has n't found one yet .
but he 's out there with a gun , looking .
a local radio station is dutifully following the hunt for the president 's boar . " we could never pay for this kind of advertising , " said micheel .
" this is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity . " micheel is convinced that the american president will feel at home in his tiny village between stralsund and rostock . " it 's like being on a ranch here , " micheel said . tastes like fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's something really fishy about traditional german recipes the local fishmonger henry rasmus will present the american president with a box of bismarck herring - the only fish in the world officially allowed to carry the noble name of germany 's greatest 19th century statesman .
rasmus bought the rights to the original recipe for marinated herring from the descendants of johann wiechmann , who served it first in 1871 to the mighty otto von bismarck , the iron chancellor . when all is said and done , angela merkel will probably breathe a sigh of relief to see george dubya 's back .
though she may get a slight headache arguing with the local government of mecklenburg - western pomerania about who 's going to foot the 12 million euro -lrb- $ 14.3 million -rrb- bill to cover the expenses of the us president 's visit . which is , if you think about it , quite pricey for two days of pure stress and a wild boar barbecue . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in greifswald , lady liberty lifts a finger what happens when a high-level diplomatic visit clashes with a politically charged musical production ?

he may , in fact , end up leaving the country thinking germany is n't so different from texas , after all . having george w. bush come over for a visit is an incredibly stressful affair for any foreign government official . first of all , there 's the issue of the president 's tough cowboy talk which usually makes most foreigners - even the occasionally overeducated head of state - rather insecure about their knowledge of english . when george dubya pronounces " america , " for example , it usually comes out as " amur-cah " or " mur-cah . "
that 's a little strange for somebody who grew up in midland , texas , but left it at the age of 15 to follow the typical path of a member of the lucky sperm club : prep school at andover , college at yale and graduate school at harvard .
george w. proudly uses his theatrical texan twang - not shared by his parents or siblings - to declare his chosen identity .
it is like his own pair of stylish cowboy boots that nobody will ever be able to rob him of . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are big fans of the us president then , there is the ever-embarrassing issue of the tireless , bush-whacking protestors .
luckily for the stressed-out hosts , the police usually sequester the demonstrators as far away from the us president as possible : see-no-evil , hear-no-evil is the best way to avoid embarrassment while playing the usual round of diplomatic charades and stressing improved bilateral relations .
as a consequence , mr. bush probably thinks that european cities are kind of lonely .
hey , condi , where did all the people go ? angie and george bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stralsund is known for its architecture on july 13 and 14 , german chancellor angela merkel will be the overstressed host trying to keep her composure when she welcomes george w. and first lady laura bush at her constituency , stralsund - a beautiful historic sea town of 60,000 in the north-eastern part of the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . during all the handshaking , the smiling and the joking that usually goes on in front of the journalists when the american president is around , members of the association " not welcome , mr. president " will be staging their protest on the outskirts of stralsund .
the downtown historic district , where bush will be hanging out , has been declared a no-protest zone . " in our talks with the police and the city , we will try to make sure we get as close as possible , both in terms of the location and the time , to the events , " said monty schädel , one of the protest organizers . ladies first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura bush will practically have nothing to do according to officials in berlin , a small special " damenprogramm " -lrb- program for ladies -rrb- has been planned for laura bush , but no details are available yet .
which is quite understandable : berlin officials in charge of the protocol are probably banging their heads against the walls of the chancellery right now .
" where , oh where , are we going to send her ? " they ask themselves . the town will be , after all , completely paralyzed during the visit .
municipal agencies and offices will be closed .
no shops will be open .

the library , the museum , the adult education center and the music school will also close their doors .
stralsunders who live in the historic district will not be allowed to open their windows or leave their apartments from 9:30 am until 16 minutes after the end of the visit . laura bush may end up having no choice but to sit around and twiddle her thumbs while george w. and angela merkel hold their talks . hunting for the president despite the planned protests , some stralsunders are actually looking forward to the presidential visit .
stralsund 's hotel royal , for example , is throwing an american barbecue party the night before bush 's arrival with country music and cowboy dancers . " the visit of the most powerful politician is a huge boost for the image of stralsund , " said hotel manager sebastian tacke .
" that has to be celebrated accordingly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : please , do n't shoot !
merkel and the bushes will themselves attend a different barbecue , one hosted by olaf micheel , an innkeeper from neighboring trinwillershagen .
in a bow to the manly , alpha-animal texan , micheel is planning to roast a wild boar that he has shot himself .
the only problem is that he has n't found one yet .
but he 's out there with a gun , looking .
a local radio station is dutifully following the hunt for the president 's boar . " we could never pay for this kind of advertising , " said micheel .
" this is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity . " micheel is convinced that the american president will feel at home in his tiny village between stralsund and rostock . " it 's like being on a ranch here , " micheel said . tastes like fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's something really fishy about traditional german recipes the local fishmonger henry rasmus will present the american president with a box of bismarck herring - the only fish in the world officially allowed to carry the noble name of germany 's greatest 19th century statesman .
rasmus bought the rights to the original recipe for marinated herring from the descendants of johann wiechmann , who served it first in 1871 to the mighty otto von bismarck , the iron chancellor . when all is said and done , angela merkel will probably breathe a sigh of relief to see george dubya 's back .

he also said he 'd move over for oliver kahn in saturday 's match for third place . after his first major tournament in net for germany , lehmann said whether he stays with the national team until euro 2008 largely depends on klinsmann continuing to coach the young team he put together for the 2006 world cup . it was klinsmann who chose to start lehmann over former germany captain kahn .
lehmann impressed many with his performance between the posts during the tournament though he did n't have a chance of stopping the italian goals that sent germany out in the semi-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and the german team want klinsmann to stay on " i will think about my personal situation after the finals and certainly chat with jürgen klinsmann about it , " the 36-year-old told reporters on thursday , adding that he would like klinsmann to stay .

" if oliver wants to play and the coach is convinced then that would be fine by me , " lehmann said .
" he has been the model professional and worked hard in training .
he has been a great example and has definitely earned it . " kahn , known for his egotistical and often arrogant outbursts on and off the field , earned the respect of much of germany by embracing lehmann in a show of support before a quarter-final penalty shoot-out against argentina , in which lehmann blocked two shots .

the winning entry came from a couple in new york city for their song , " the streets of berlin . " when david barkhymer suggested to his wife holly that they submit a song for the deutsche welle contest he 'd recently seen announced on the web site , she was more than a little skeptical . " i thought , they 're going to hate this idea , they do n't want a song " she said with a grimace .
" and then when we did end up submitting a song whose first lines talked about the grey berlin sky , i did n't think we had a chance . " the two new york city residents are telling this story from the deutsche welle offices in berlin , where they 've come as the contest 's grand-prize winners .
their song , which relates some of holly 's fond memories of her year spent in the german capital , beat hundreds of other entries sent in from around the globe . both holly , 33 , and david , 34 , consider themselves germanophiles , something holly said in her case developed long before she knew there was a name for it .
her best childhood friend had german parents , and as she grew older , she found she was attracted to german music , poetry and literature .
as she got to know contemporary germany better , she began to appreciate many aspects of life here . " i like germans ' concern for the environment and the country 's social safety net , " she said .
" and while you ca n't paint with too broad a brush , i think germans are a people who generally think things through .
it 's a pretty good place . " in a way , she has germany to thank for meeting her husband david , who also has a soft-spot for german movies , bands and soccer .
the two first met in a nightclub because david was wearing a shirt with the word polizei -lrb- police -rrb- on it .
that sparked holly 's interest and she struck up a conversation .
the two were married last october . city tour , sung to david , a special education teacher who plays guitar and bass , writing a song for the deutsche welle contest seemed like a natural for the couple .
holly , who does pr for the michael j. fox foundation , is a classically trained singer , and the two had been recording music in their apartment , mostly jazz standards , for several years . after holly agreed to the song idea , david wrote the guitar part and asked holly to write about berlin , where she 'd lived in the prenzlauer berg district from the summer of 1999 to the fall of 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tv tower , featured in the winning song " i fell in love with the energy of the place and i felt it was a time rich with possibilities , " she said .
" i was far from home and wanted to try things out . " their song is akin to a walk holly might have taken around the city then , listing off her favorite places : kreuzberg , the babylon cinema , the tiergarten park or iconic fernsehturm -lrb- tv tower -rrb- . while she does mention berlin 's heavy grey skies in her lyrics , she left out some other aspects that were difficult for her here , such as the notorious brusque manner of many native berliners .
" there were a few times back then when i was in tears , " she said . sites to see she and david said they were were thrilled to learn that deutsche welle was flying them to berlin for a week and plan to pack as much into their trip as possible .
they stayed with david 's brother , who teaches in wiesbaden , for a few days , where they were crushed by germany 's defeat by the italians in the world cup semi-finals .
now , they appear to have mostly bounced back , and want to hit as many sites in the capital as they can before flying home on sunday . one thing on the schedule is time spent in the beer gardens , where they plan on drinking their fair share of german beer ..
while they say new york city has everything , there are some things even the big apple ca n't guarantee 100 percent of the time . " when i was here , i could just go to any place around the corner and ask for a beer , " said holly .

the winning entry came from a couple in new york city for their song , " the streets of berlin . " when david barkhymer suggested to his wife holly that they submit a song for the deutsche welle contest he 'd recently seen announced on the web site , she was more than a little skeptical . " i thought , they 're going to hate this idea , they do n't want a song " she said with a grimace .
" and then when we did end up submitting a song whose first lines talked about the grey berlin sky , i did n't think we had a chance . " the two new york city residents are telling this story from the deutsche welle offices in berlin , where they 've come as the contest 's grand-prize winners .
their song , which relates some of holly 's fond memories of her year spent in the german capital , beat hundreds of other entries sent in from around the globe . both holly , 33 , and david , 34 , consider themselves germanophiles , something holly said in her case developed long before she knew there was a name for it .
her best childhood friend had german parents , and as she grew older , she found she was attracted to german music , poetry and literature .
as she got to know contemporary germany better , she began to appreciate many aspects of life here . " i like germans ' concern for the environment and the country 's social safety net , " she said .
" and while you ca n't paint with too broad a brush , i think germans are a people who generally think things through .
it 's a pretty good place . " in a way , she has germany to thank for meeting her husband david , who also has a soft-spot for german movies , bands and soccer .
the two first met in a nightclub because david was wearing a shirt with the word polizei -lrb- police -rrb- on it .
that sparked holly 's interest and she struck up a conversation .
the two were married last october . city tour , sung to david , a special education teacher who plays guitar and bass , writing a song for the deutsche welle contest seemed like a natural for the couple .
holly , who does pr for the michael j. fox foundation , is a classically trained singer , and the two had been recording music in their apartment , mostly jazz standards , for several years . after holly agreed to the song idea , david wrote the guitar part and asked holly to write about berlin , where she 'd lived in the prenzlauer berg district from the summer of 1999 to the fall of 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tv tower , featured in the winning song " i fell in love with the energy of the place and i felt it was a time rich with possibilities , " she said .
" i was far from home and wanted to try things out . " their song is akin to a walk holly might have taken around the city then , listing off her favorite places : kreuzberg , the babylon cinema , the tiergarten park or iconic fernsehturm -lrb- tv tower -rrb- . while she does mention berlin 's heavy grey skies in her lyrics , she left out some other aspects that were difficult for her here , such as the notorious brusque manner of many native berliners .
" there were a few times back then when i was in tears , " she said . sites to see she and david said they were were thrilled to learn that deutsche welle was flying them to berlin for a week and plan to pack as much into their trip as possible .
they stayed with david 's brother , who teaches in wiesbaden , for a few days , where they were crushed by germany 's defeat by the italians in the world cup semi-finals .
now , they appear to have mostly bounced back , and want to hit as many sites in the capital as they can before flying home on sunday . one thing on the schedule is time spent in the beer gardens , where they plan on drinking their fair share of german beer ..
while they say new york city has everything , there are some things even the big apple ca n't guarantee 100 percent of the time . " when i was here , i could just go to any place around the corner and ask for a beer , " said holly .
" i would n't even know what i was getting , but i knew it 'd be delicious .

the german parliament agreed this week not only to extend the anti-terror laws passed in early 2001 , but to make them more stringent .
advocates of civil liberties are outraged . in the wake of september 11 , german law makers passed a series of anti-terror laws that are due to expire at the end of the year .
this week , germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats agreed on proposals that would not only extend the controversial laws but make them even tougher . " so far , scans of information databases have only been allowed in connection with terror suspects , " explained stefan kalle , spokesman for the ministry of the interior .
" it is now planned to extend this to include rightwing extremists and militant islamists such as hate preachers operating in germany . " broader investigating power for police the existing laws , which went into effect in early 2002 , allow police and secret services to use telephone communications , emails , faxes , bank accounts and travel data as sources of information .
under the proposed revisions , access to the same would be expanded .
in addition , germany 's foreign intelligence service , bnd would have wider access to domestic police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german stasi had a file on nearly everyone until now , the anti-terror laws have been implemented in terror suspect cases .
if approved , the new laws would be broadened to include possible consequences for individuals who may belong to extremist organizations but are not suspected of terror crimes . the proposal , intended to help combat islamic fundamentalists as well as rightwing extremists , is scheduled to be put up for approval after the parliament 's summer recess . a " cookie monster " the proposals however have run into fierce opposition in some quarters . the government is acting like a " cookie monster , " said wolfgang wieland , speaker for domestic affairs of the left-leaning green party .
" they always want more , more , more and are never satisfied , " wieland told german news agency dpa . wieland is not alone in his criticism .
hans christian ströbele , a senior green party member , was a bitter opponent of the first set of anti-terror laws " because they amount to a gross violation of our democratic rights , first and foremost our right to privacy .
the new measures cap it all because they even expand these violations to even more sectors of the population . " max stadler from the free-market liberal free democrats argued that the laws are yet another step toward an orwellian surveillance system : " experience shows that once the door has been opened , the state encroaches further and further on our civil rights , " he said . " my worst fears are coming true , especially when you see that police duties are to be taken over by the secret services , which no one really controls in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ensslin and baader belonged to " red army fraction " in the 1970s history knows both sides germany has experience with both sides of the issue in its recent collective memory . on the one hand , the country experienced consequences of catastrophic proportions when nazi rightwing extremists gained a foothold in the 1930s .
and in the 1970s and 80s , terrorist groups like the " rote armee fraktion " -lrb- raf -rrb- were active .
but on the other hand , thousands of germans also experienced excessive state surveillance by the stasi or secret police in east germany . when the proposed revisions to the anti-terrorism laws go up for approval after the summer recess , german lawmakers will also have to align their decision with a may ruling from the country 's highest court that police profiling to find terrorists is unconstitutional . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in war on terror , how far is too far ?
the affair over secret cia prisoner transports in europe has revived a partisan debate within germany over internal security .
what should - and should n't - be allowed in the fight against terror ?
-lrb- dec .
27 , 2005 -rrb- european governments aided in cia abductions , says report a new report released wednesday by europe 's top human rights body provides more details about european aid to the us in transporting terrorism suspects and the existence of secret prisons in eastern europe .

he may , in fact , end up leaving the country thinking germany is n't so different from texas , after all . having george w. bush come over for a visit is an incredibly stressful affair for any foreign government official . first of all , there 's the issue of the president 's tough cowboy talk which usually makes most foreigners - even the occasionally overeducated head of state - rather insecure about their knowledge of english . when george dubya pronounces " america , " for example , it usually comes out as " amur-cah " or " mur-cah . "
that 's a little strange for somebody who grew up in midland , texas , but left it at the age of 15 to follow the typical path of a member of the lucky sperm club : prep school at andover , college at yale and graduate school at harvard .
george w. proudly uses his theatrical texan twang - not shared by his parents or siblings - to declare his chosen identity .
it is like his own pair of stylish cowboy boots that nobody will ever be able to rob him of . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are big fans of the us president then , there is the ever-embarrassing issue of the tireless , bush-whacking protestors .
luckily for the stressed-out hosts , the police usually sequester the demonstrators as far away from the us president as possible : see-no-evil , hear-no-evil is the best way to avoid embarrassment while playing the usual round of diplomatic charades and stressing improved bilateral relations .
as a consequence , mr. bush probably thinks that european cities are kind of lonely .
hey , condi , where did all the people go ? angie and george bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stralsund is known for its architecture on july 13 and 14 , german chancellor angela merkel will be the overstressed host trying to keep her composure when she welcomes george w. and first lady laura bush at her constituency , stralsund - a beautiful historic sea town of 60,000 in the north-eastern part of the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . during all the handshaking , the smiling and the joking that usually goes on in front of the journalists when the american president is around , members of the association " not welcome , mr. president " will be staging their protest on the outskirts of stralsund .
the downtown historic district , where bush will be hanging out , has been declared a no-protest zone . " in our talks with the police and the city , we will try to make sure we get as close as possible , both in terms of the location and the time , to the events , " said monty schädel , one of the protest organizers . ladies first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura bush will practically have nothing to do according to officials in berlin , a small special " damenprogramm " -lrb- program for ladies -rrb- has been planned for laura bush , but no details are available yet .
which is quite understandable : berlin officials in charge of the protocol are probably banging their heads against the walls of the chancellery right now .
" where , oh where , are we going to send her ? " they ask themselves . the town will be , after all , completely paralyzed during the visit .
municipal agencies and offices will be closed .
no shops will be open .
entering the town 's historic central district will be possible only through one of two check points .
the library , the museum , the adult education center and the music school will also close their doors .
stralsunders who live in the historic district will not be allowed to open their windows or leave their apartments from 9:30 am until 16 minutes after the end of the visit . laura bush may end up having no choice but to sit around and twiddle her thumbs while george w. and angela merkel hold their talks . hunting for the president despite the planned protests , some stralsunders are actually looking forward to the presidential visit .
stralsund 's hotel royal , for example , is throwing an american barbecue party the night before bush 's arrival with country music and cowboy dancers . " the visit of the most powerful politician is a huge boost for the image of stralsund , " said hotel manager sebastian tacke .
" that has to be celebrated accordingly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : please , do n't shoot !
merkel and the bushes will themselves attend a different barbecue , one hosted by olaf micheel , an innkeeper from neighboring trinwillershagen .
in a bow to the manly , alpha-animal texan , micheel is planning to roast a wild boar that he has shot himself .
the only problem is that he has n't found one yet .
but he 's out there with a gun , looking .
a local radio station is dutifully following the hunt for the president 's boar . " we could never pay for this kind of advertising , " said micheel .
" this is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity . " micheel is convinced that the american president will feel at home in his tiny village between stralsund and rostock . " it 's like being on a ranch here , " micheel said . tastes like fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's something really fishy about traditional german recipes the local fishmonger henry rasmus will present the american president with a box of bismarck herring - the only fish in the world officially allowed to carry the noble name of germany 's greatest 19th century statesman .
rasmus bought the rights to the original recipe for marinated herring from the descendants of johann wiechmann , who served it first in 1871 to the mighty otto von bismarck , the iron chancellor . when all is said and done , angela merkel will probably breathe a sigh of relief to see george dubya 's back .
though she may get a slight headache arguing with the local government of mecklenburg - western pomerania about who 's going to foot the 12 million euro -lrb- $ 14.3 million -rrb- bill to cover the expenses of the us president 's visit . which is , if you think about it , quite pricey for two days of pure stress and a wild boar barbecue . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in greifswald , lady liberty lifts a finger what happens when a high-level diplomatic visit clashes with a politically charged musical production ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 06.07.2006 wild boar barbecue for mr. & mrs. bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she thinks he 's funny : german chancellor angela merkel and us president george w. bush when george w. bush comes to germany next week , he 'll get to enjoy , among other things , a wild boar barbecue .
he may , in fact , end up leaving the country thinking germany is n't so different from texas , after all . having george w. bush come over for a visit is an incredibly stressful affair for any foreign government official . first of all , there 's the issue of the president 's tough cowboy talk which usually makes most foreigners - even the occasionally overeducated head of state - rather insecure about their knowledge of english . when george dubya pronounces " america , " for example , it usually comes out as " amur-cah " or " mur-cah . "
that 's a little strange for somebody who grew up in midland , texas , but left it at the age of 15 to follow the typical path of a member of the lucky sperm club : prep school at andover , college at yale and graduate school at harvard .
george w. proudly uses his theatrical texan twang - not shared by his parents or siblings - to declare his chosen identity .
it is like his own pair of stylish cowboy boots that nobody will ever be able to rob him of . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are big fans of the us president then , there is the ever-embarrassing issue of the tireless , bush-whacking protestors .
luckily for the stressed-out hosts , the police usually sequester the demonstrators as far away from the us president as possible : see-no-evil , hear-no-evil is the best way to avoid embarrassment while playing the usual round of diplomatic charades and stressing improved bilateral relations .
as a consequence , mr. bush probably thinks that european cities are kind of lonely .
hey , condi , where did all the people go ? angie and george bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stralsund is known for its architecture on july 13 and 14 , german chancellor angela merkel will be the overstressed host trying to keep her composure when she welcomes george w. and first lady laura bush at her constituency , stralsund - a beautiful historic sea town of 60,000 in the north-eastern part of the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . during all the handshaking , the smiling and the joking that usually goes on in front of the journalists when the american president is around , members of the association " not welcome , mr. president " will be staging their protest on the outskirts of stralsund .
the downtown historic district , where bush will be hanging out , has been declared a no-protest zone . " in our talks with the police and the city , we will try to make sure we get as close as possible , both in terms of the location and the time , to the events , " said monty schädel , one of the protest organizers . ladies first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura bush will practically have nothing to do according to officials in berlin , a small special " damenprogramm " -lrb- program for ladies -rrb- has been planned for laura bush , but no details are available yet .
which is quite understandable : berlin officials in charge of the protocol are probably banging their heads against the walls of the chancellery right now .
" where , oh where , are we going to send her ? " they ask themselves . the town will be , after all , completely paralyzed during the visit .
municipal agencies and offices will be closed .
no shops will be open .
entering the town 's historic central district will be possible only through one of two check points .
the library , the museum , the adult education center and the music school will also close their doors .
stralsunders who live in the historic district will not be allowed to open their windows or leave their apartments from 9:30 am until 16 minutes after the end of the visit . laura bush may end up having no choice but to sit around and twiddle her thumbs while george w. and angela merkel hold their talks . hunting for the president despite the planned protests , some stralsunders are actually looking forward to the presidential visit .
stralsund 's hotel royal , for example , is throwing an american barbecue party the night before bush 's arrival with country music and cowboy dancers . " the visit of the most powerful politician is a huge boost for the image of stralsund , " said hotel manager sebastian tacke .
" that has to be celebrated accordingly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : please , do n't shoot !
merkel and the bushes will themselves attend a different barbecue , one hosted by olaf micheel , an innkeeper from neighboring trinwillershagen .
in a bow to the manly , alpha-animal texan , micheel is planning to roast a wild boar that he has shot himself .
the only problem is that he has n't found one yet .
but he 's out there with a gun , looking .
a local radio station is dutifully following the hunt for the president 's boar . " we could never pay for this kind of advertising , " said micheel .
" this is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity . " micheel is convinced that the american president will feel at home in his tiny village between stralsund and rostock . " it 's like being on a ranch here , " micheel said . tastes like fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's something really fishy about traditional german recipes the local fishmonger henry rasmus will present the american president with a box of bismarck herring - the only fish in the world officially allowed to carry the noble name of germany 's greatest 19th century statesman .

the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .
in fact , after they leave school , only about one-half of them have the qualifications to begin an apprenticeship program . " the economy is the most important integration mechanism we have , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
" that 's why i ask that we take our responsibility in creating enough apprenticeships for young people very seriously , even in lower-skilled professions . " low-wage expansion according to him , the majority of young people with immigrant backgrounds will enter professions that are not in the highly skilled sector , but in sectors that require less training .
that is why he has called for reform in the country 's low-wage sector , since he says without the creation of additional jobs in this area , the threat of illegal work will only grow . still , creating more low-wage jobs runs contrary to what the economy is looking for in the future .
otto kenzler , present of the german confederation of skills crafts , says both industry and young people must be involved in bringing more skilled labor into the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people should start looking for trainee spots early " i can only advise young people to get in contact with companies early on , even during their time at school , " he said .
" the fact that they have a goal in front of them and a chance at an apprenticeship has help them considerably . " foreign-owned businesses just under 24 percent of german companies offer training program for young people , although only 15 percent of those companies with owners of foreign origin do .
that should change , according to nihat sorgec , director of the kreuzberg educational works , who works with many business owned by people of turkish origin . " in the meanwhile , there are more than 60,000 businesspeople of turkish origin in germany .
they employ more than 320,000 people and have annual sales of over 30 billion euros , " he said .
" according to estimates , that number will double in the next 10 to 15 years . " but statistics such as these are n't enough to meet the problem of a future lack of qualified personnel , according to dieter hundt .
he has called for a change in germany 's immigration policy .
he 'd like , for example , to link immigration to germany to qualifications such as education , work experience and language ability . " a rational immigration policy that is oriented toward the needs of the labor market can do a lot for overall economic dynamism and job creation , " he said . that is an opinion that the head of the munich-based institute of economic research , hans-werner sinn , shares .

" foreign-owned businesses just under 24 percent of german companies offer training program for young people , although only 15 percent of those companies with owners of foreign origin do .
that should change , according to nihat sorgec , director of the kreuzberg educational works , who works with many business owned by people of turkish origin . " in the meanwhile , there are more than 60,000 businesspeople of turkish origin in germany .
they employ more than 320,000 people and have annual sales of over 30 billion euros , " he said .
" according to estimates , that number will double in the next 10 to 15 years . " but statistics such as these are n't enough to meet the problem of a future lack of qualified personnel , according to dieter hundt .
he has called for a change in germany 's immigration policy .

" a rational immigration policy that is oriented toward the needs of the labor market can do a lot for overall economic dynamism and job creation , " he said . that is an opinion that the head of the munich-based institute of economic research , hans-werner sinn , shares .

this week , germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats agreed on proposals that would not only extend the controversial laws but make them even tougher . " so far , scans of information databases have only been allowed in connection with terror suspects , " explained stefan kalle , spokesman for the ministry of the interior .
" it is now planned to extend this to include rightwing extremists and militant islamists such as hate preachers operating in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.07.2006 singing berlin 's praises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holly and david barkhymer , contest winners in the run-up to the world cup , deutsche welle held a contest asking people to share their impressions of germany .
the winning entry came from a couple in new york city for their song , " the streets of berlin . " when david barkhymer suggested to his wife holly that they submit a song for the deutsche welle contest he 'd recently seen announced on the web site , she was more than a little skeptical . " i thought , they 're going to hate this idea , they do n't want a song " she said with a grimace .
" and then when we did end up submitting a song whose first lines talked about the grey berlin sky , i did n't think we had a chance . " the two new york city residents are telling this story from the deutsche welle offices in berlin , where they 've come as the contest 's grand-prize winners .
their song , which relates some of holly 's fond memories of her year spent in the german capital , beat hundreds of other entries sent in from around the globe . both holly , 33 , and david , 34 , consider themselves germanophiles , something holly said in her case developed long before she knew there was a name for it .
her best childhood friend had german parents , and as she grew older , she found she was attracted to german music , poetry and literature .
as she got to know contemporary germany better , she began to appreciate many aspects of life here . " i like germans ' concern for the environment and the country 's social safety net , " she said .
" and while you ca n't paint with too broad a brush , i think germans are a people who generally think things through .
it 's a pretty good place . " in a way , she has germany to thank for meeting her husband david , who also has a soft-spot for german movies , bands and soccer .
the two first met in a nightclub because david was wearing a shirt with the word polizei -lrb- police -rrb- on it .

the german parliament agreed this week not only to extend the anti-terror laws passed in early 2001 , but to make them more stringent .
advocates of civil liberties are outraged . in the wake of september 11 , german law makers passed a series of anti-terror laws that are due to expire at the end of the year .
this week , germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats agreed on proposals that would not only extend the controversial laws but make them even tougher . " so far , scans of information databases have only been allowed in connection with terror suspects , " explained stefan kalle , spokesman for the ministry of the interior .
" it is now planned to extend this to include rightwing extremists and militant islamists such as hate preachers operating in germany . " broader investigating power for police the existing laws , which went into effect in early 2002 , allow police and secret services to use telephone communications , emails , faxes , bank accounts and travel data as sources of information .
under the proposed revisions , access to the same would be expanded .
in addition , germany 's foreign intelligence service , bnd would have wider access to domestic police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german stasi had a file on nearly everyone until now , the anti-terror laws have been implemented in terror suspect cases .
if approved , the new laws would be broadened to include possible consequences for individuals who may belong to extremist organizations but are not suspected of terror crimes . the proposal , intended to help combat islamic fundamentalists as well as rightwing extremists , is scheduled to be put up for approval after the parliament 's summer recess . a " cookie monster " the proposals however have run into fierce opposition in some quarters . the government is acting like a " cookie monster , " said wolfgang wieland , speaker for domestic affairs of the left-leaning green party .
" they always want more , more , more and are never satisfied , " wieland told german news agency dpa . wieland is not alone in his criticism .
hans christian ströbele , a senior green party member , was a bitter opponent of the first set of anti-terror laws " because they amount to a gross violation of our democratic rights , first and foremost our right to privacy .
the new measures cap it all because they even expand these violations to even more sectors of the population . " max stadler from the free-market liberal free democrats argued that the laws are yet another step toward an orwellian surveillance system : " experience shows that once the door has been opened , the state encroaches further and further on our civil rights , " he said . " my worst fears are coming true , especially when you see that police duties are to be taken over by the secret services , which no one really controls in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ensslin and baader belonged to " red army fraction " in the 1970s history knows both sides germany has experience with both sides of the issue in its recent collective memory . on the one hand , the country experienced consequences of catastrophic proportions when nazi rightwing extremists gained a foothold in the 1930s .
and in the 1970s and 80s , terrorist groups like the " rote armee fraktion " -lrb- raf -rrb- were active .
but on the other hand , thousands of germans also experienced excessive state surveillance by the stasi or secret police in east germany . when the proposed revisions to the anti-terrorism laws go up for approval after the summer recess , german lawmakers will also have to align their decision with a may ruling from the country 's highest court that police profiling to find terrorists is unconstitutional . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in war on terror , how far is too far ?

" if oliver wants to play and the coach is convinced then that would be fine by me , " lehmann said .
" he has been the model professional and worked hard in training .
he has been a great example and has definitely earned it . " kahn , known for his egotistical and often arrogant outbursts on and off the field , earned the respect of much of germany by embracing lehmann in a show of support before a quarter-final penalty shoot-out against argentina , in which lehmann blocked two shots .

the winning entry came from a couple in new york city for their song , " the streets of berlin . " when david barkhymer suggested to his wife holly that they submit a song for the deutsche welle contest he 'd recently seen announced on the web site , she was more than a little skeptical . " i thought , they 're going to hate this idea , they do n't want a song " she said with a grimace .
" and then when we did end up submitting a song whose first lines talked about the grey berlin sky , i did n't think we had a chance . " the two new york city residents are telling this story from the deutsche welle offices in berlin , where they 've come as the contest 's grand-prize winners .
their song , which relates some of holly 's fond memories of her year spent in the german capital , beat hundreds of other entries sent in from around the globe . both holly , 33 , and david , 34 , consider themselves germanophiles , something holly said in her case developed long before she knew there was a name for it .
her best childhood friend had german parents , and as she grew older , she found she was attracted to german music , poetry and literature .
as she got to know contemporary germany better , she began to appreciate many aspects of life here . " i like germans ' concern for the environment and the country 's social safety net , " she said .
" and while you ca n't paint with too broad a brush , i think germans are a people who generally think things through .
it 's a pretty good place . " in a way , she has germany to thank for meeting her husband david , who also has a soft-spot for german movies , bands and soccer .
the two first met in a nightclub because david was wearing a shirt with the word polizei -lrb- police -rrb- on it .
that sparked holly 's interest and she struck up a conversation .
the two were married last october . city tour , sung to david , a special education teacher who plays guitar and bass , writing a song for the deutsche welle contest seemed like a natural for the couple .
holly , who does pr for the michael j. fox foundation , is a classically trained singer , and the two had been recording music in their apartment , mostly jazz standards , for several years . after holly agreed to the song idea , david wrote the guitar part and asked holly to write about berlin , where she 'd lived in the prenzlauer berg district from the summer of 1999 to the fall of 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tv tower , featured in the winning song " i fell in love with the energy of the place and i felt it was a time rich with possibilities , " she said .
" i was far from home and wanted to try things out . " their song is akin to a walk holly might have taken around the city then , listing off her favorite places : kreuzberg , the babylon cinema , the tiergarten park or iconic fernsehturm -lrb- tv tower -rrb- . while she does mention berlin 's heavy grey skies in her lyrics , she left out some other aspects that were difficult for her here , such as the notorious brusque manner of many native berliners .
" there were a few times back then when i was in tears , " she said . sites to see she and david said they were were thrilled to learn that deutsche welle was flying them to berlin for a week and plan to pack as much into their trip as possible .
they stayed with david 's brother , who teaches in wiesbaden , for a few days , where they were crushed by germany 's defeat by the italians in the world cup semi-finals .
now , they appear to have mostly bounced back , and want to hit as many sites in the capital as they can before flying home on sunday . one thing on the schedule is time spent in the beer gardens , where they plan on drinking their fair share of german beer ..
while they say new york city has everything , there are some things even the big apple ca n't guarantee 100 percent of the time . " when i was here , i could just go to any place around the corner and ask for a beer , " said holly .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . doping tests at the world cup ? as a soccer fan who does not know too much about soccer , i have made the following observation pertaining to the italian team .
against the usa , they were slow and played a mediocre game .
throughout the cup , the italians were very inconsistent , contrary to the german team who maintained their style and great performance .
having seen the italians come to life for the first time in the game against germany , i can not help but wonder , what exactly happened to cause such a turn-around in performance ?
though i have seen many sports events in the usa , i have never seen a team that has displayed such an improvement as the italians did .
in the usa , this sudden change in performance would be suspect and subject to testing -lrb- dope -rrb- .
does the fifa also test during the world cup ?
just curious .
no , i am not a sore loser because of the usa team being eliminated so early , i am merely making observations .
i 'd love to receive your response . - anita morrell dw-world.de checked it out .
according to the fifa website , random doping test were conducting by specialized doctors in the matches that led up to the world cup as well as in the training camps .
all the national team doctors signed a pledge promising to support fifa 's anti-doping strategy .
their motto : " an injury- and doping-free football festival for 2006 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many would be happy to see coach juergen klinsmann stay soccer was boring … until germany played hello , i am just a girl from nz who had never watched football before in her life - i even thought the sport was a little silly before !
but then the fifa world cup started and my friend in germany asked me to just watch one match .
i did , and never looked back .
i watched all the teams during the cup , but the one that stuck with me was germany .
people all around me were putting them down and criticising them , even before their first game .
but then they gave everything they had , and when their fans cheered louder ballack and his crew fought harder .
i watched as this germany team gave their heart , soul and spirit to make their fans proud .
klose became the world cup 's top scorer .
lehmann played so brilliantly - he 's up for top player .
ballack was injured during a game but refused to give up , even though he was in pain .
i was amazed at how much heart and determination this team was showing .
so , germany has lost its semi-final - so what !
germany , you have a right to be proud !
you have a team that showed so much skill , so much pride - and that has astounded & impressed people worldwide since the very first match .
and they will only get better .
so , please wave your flags , dress yourselves up , show us again how proud , patriotic and amazing our hosts truly are ! - erin mackey , new zealand the german spirit ca n't be beat from what i 've seen , the host nation has been great and handled everything well , but what has impressed me most is the resolve and enthusiasm of the players on the field .
they definitely won me over during the tournament and i am sad to see germany lose , but with such young talent , am hopeful to see some great performances in the future from the german side . - michael terry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans say germany deserves to be proud okay ... so you did n't win ... but look at what you gave the world to see !
what a game !
in my opinion , the world came to a complete standstill until the first goal was made !
it will be the game talked about for years !
it does n't matter who won or lost , that 's in the score book .
what really matters is the determination from both teams that gave the world an event that will be remembered beyond our lifetimes .
both countries have something to be proud of , regardless who won and who lost .
it was the players ' spirit that captured the interest of the world !
so cheer up and enjoy ... there 's will always be a next time . - m.l. cole come on germany , do not grieve for more than 10 minutes over your loss to italy .
you hosted the world cup and you took in the soca warriors with open arms .
thirty-five thousand of you supported us at kaiserslautern , knowing that we would not make it to the round of 16 .
we may never have this many people support us ever again , even in our own home country .
we in turn showed you the game is not everything .
we celebrated each of our three games in the happiest of ways , as you should celebrate being the best hosts ever to stage these games .
you have made all participating nations unreservedly welcome .
we , the soca warriors , felt especially favored , but no doubt all visitors to these games must surely feel the same .
the world cup 2006 will set the standard for future world cups in country pride and celebrations .
get back out there and show us all that match results , even up to the final , are only a minor part of the massive international goodwill you have gained by staging these games .
celebration equals dignity .
be dignified . - george butcher , trinidad & tobago bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trinidad and tobago lost to paraguay 0-2 in kaiserslautern my family and i watched the game today - germany can be so proud , i certainly was .
good showing and a wonderful world cup !
it was great seeing the german pride and show of their colors and flags !
great job ! - elfriede parsons from across the channel … germany : the hosts of the best world cup ever !
i 'm an englishman who cheered for germany and was disappointed by your loss .
but be proud , your team has been fantastic , klinsi is a revelation , your supporters are magnificent and the excitement of this world cup has been unrivalled .
thank you all very much .
maybe next time the england team can live up to the high standards of the germans ! - mike … and beyond my son -lrb- aged nine -rrb- is a fan of this team .
he slept early & woke up at 12:30 a.m. -lrb- it is cet + 3hrs30min in bangalore -rrb- , and watched 120 minutes of play .
then he cried . - sridhar uppada , india i am a german football fan from albania .
it was a pleasure to see klinsmann 's boys play like that .
i think it was wonderful and hope that we will win the next world cup . - ladi although i currently live in the usa , i lived in germany for six years and my husband is german .
i have never been as passionate about the world cup as i have been this year !
we watched the italy-germany game with italian friends and with great humor they let me scream my head off , complete with cursing in german , throughout the game .
i was heartbroken to see germany lose the game and yet , what i see is a new and wonderful and shiny german pride emerging that is long overdue .
go deutschland !
you have friends everywhere !
who knows ?
we may even end up with your coach , although i would prefer he stay with his wonderful team .
i secretly do not want the usa to get that good in " fussball ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " italy won fair and square " germany did n't " really " win at all i saw all of germany 's games and i have n't seen a host country play so poorly at home .
who did they beat ?
no one .
ecuador , poland , and sweden are a joke .
they did n't beat argentina or italy either .
the balloon exploded in their face . anyway i can assure you we will see better football from anyone but germany . - natan lubenfeld german fan since ' 74 i was 10 years old when i watched my first world cup , and ever since 1974 i have been a die-hard german team fan .
i ca n't describe how sad i am the german team did not make the final .
however , i 'm proud of how well the team played , despite utilizing younger players .
at the same time , one has to congratulate the italian team for winning fair and square . - carlos r. quintana , torrance , california kudos for klinsmann a huge congratulations to the german team .
i hope that klinsmann stays and that the team does not lose hope .
they really did their country proud .
what a fantastic -lrb- semi-final -rrb- match -lrb- from someone who normally hates football . -rrb-
i have watched all of germany 's matches and enjoyed every one . - doreen hill klinsmann should stay and continue his job .
klinsmann has done a good job for the germans .
he took them to the semi-final .
i think he has done very well , so please congratulate him and support him too as the german coach .
they did very well , only luck is not on their side . - abu karim compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : chin up , germany european editorials on wednesday commented on germany 's dramatic loss to italy in tuesday 's world cup semi-final match , with most papers giving germany a sympathetic pat on the back for a job well done .
-lrb- july 5 , 2006 -rrb- germany wants klinsmann to stay hounded for poor performances before the world cup , jürgen klinsmann could have resigned and relieved a nation .
now after reaching the semi-finals on home soil , no one wants to let him leave any earlier than 2008 .
-lrb- july 5 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : why it 's good that " we " lost july 4 is unlikely to become a german national holiday after italy thwarted the country 's world cup hopes on tuesday .
but maybe it 's a date worth celebrating once the tears have dried , says dw-world.de 's mathis winkler .

most gave klinsmann and his eleven a giant pat on the back . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . doping tests at the world cup ? as a soccer fan who does not know too much about soccer , i have made the following observation pertaining to the italian team .
against the usa , they were slow and played a mediocre game .
throughout the cup , the italians were very inconsistent , contrary to the german team who maintained their style and great performance .
having seen the italians come to life for the first time in the game against germany , i can not help but wonder , what exactly happened to cause such a turn-around in performance ?
though i have seen many sports events in the usa , i have never seen a team that has displayed such an improvement as the italians did .
in the usa , this sudden change in performance would be suspect and subject to testing -lrb- dope -rrb- .
does the fifa also test during the world cup ?
just curious .
no , i am not a sore loser because of the usa team being eliminated so early , i am merely making observations .
i 'd love to receive your response . - anita morrell dw-world.de checked it out .
according to the fifa website , random doping test were conducting by specialized doctors in the matches that led up to the world cup as well as in the training camps .
all the national team doctors signed a pledge promising to support fifa 's anti-doping strategy .
their motto : " an injury- and doping-free football festival for 2006 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many would be happy to see coach juergen klinsmann stay soccer was boring … until germany played hello , i am just a girl from nz who had never watched football before in her life - i even thought the sport was a little silly before !
but then the fifa world cup started and my friend in germany asked me to just watch one match .
i did , and never looked back .
i watched all the teams during the cup , but the one that stuck with me was germany .
people all around me were putting them down and criticising them , even before their first game .
but then they gave everything they had , and when their fans cheered louder ballack and his crew fought harder .
i watched as this germany team gave their heart , soul and spirit to make their fans proud .
klose became the world cup 's top scorer .
lehmann played so brilliantly - he 's up for top player .
ballack was injured during a game but refused to give up , even though he was in pain .
i was amazed at how much heart and determination this team was showing .
so , germany has lost its semi-final - so what !
germany , you have a right to be proud !
you have a team that showed so much skill , so much pride - and that has astounded & impressed people worldwide since the very first match .
and they will only get better .
so , please wave your flags , dress yourselves up , show us again how proud , patriotic and amazing our hosts truly are ! - erin mackey , new zealand the german spirit ca n't be beat from what i 've seen , the host nation has been great and handled everything well , but what has impressed me most is the resolve and enthusiasm of the players on the field .
they definitely won me over during the tournament and i am sad to see germany lose , but with such young talent , am hopeful to see some great performances in the future from the german side . - michael terry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans say germany deserves to be proud okay ... so you did n't win ... but look at what you gave the world to see !
what a game !
in my opinion , the world came to a complete standstill until the first goal was made !
it will be the game talked about for years !
it does n't matter who won or lost , that 's in the score book .
what really matters is the determination from both teams that gave the world an event that will be remembered beyond our lifetimes .
both countries have something to be proud of , regardless who won and who lost .
it was the players ' spirit that captured the interest of the world !
so cheer up and enjoy ... there 's will always be a next time . - m.l. cole come on germany , do not grieve for more than 10 minutes over your loss to italy .
you hosted the world cup and you took in the soca warriors with open arms .
thirty-five thousand of you supported us at kaiserslautern , knowing that we would not make it to the round of 16 .
we may never have this many people support us ever again , even in our own home country .
we in turn showed you the game is not everything .
we celebrated each of our three games in the happiest of ways , as you should celebrate being the best hosts ever to stage these games .
you have made all participating nations unreservedly welcome .
we , the soca warriors , felt especially favored , but no doubt all visitors to these games must surely feel the same .
the world cup 2006 will set the standard for future world cups in country pride and celebrations .
get back out there and show us all that match results , even up to the final , are only a minor part of the massive international goodwill you have gained by staging these games .

the german parliament agreed this week not only to extend the anti-terror laws passed in early 2001 , but to make them more stringent .
advocates of civil liberties are outraged . in the wake of september 11 , german law makers passed a series of anti-terror laws that are due to expire at the end of the year .
this week , germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats agreed on proposals that would not only extend the controversial laws but make them even tougher . " so far , scans of information databases have only been allowed in connection with terror suspects , " explained stefan kalle , spokesman for the ministry of the interior .
" it is now planned to extend this to include rightwing extremists and militant islamists such as hate preachers operating in germany . " broader investigating power for police the existing laws , which went into effect in early 2002 , allow police and secret services to use telephone communications , emails , faxes , bank accounts and travel data as sources of information .
under the proposed revisions , access to the same would be expanded .
in addition , germany 's foreign intelligence service , bnd would have wider access to domestic police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german stasi had a file on nearly everyone until now , the anti-terror laws have been implemented in terror suspect cases .
if approved , the new laws would be broadened to include possible consequences for individuals who may belong to extremist organizations but are not suspected of terror crimes . the proposal , intended to help combat islamic fundamentalists as well as rightwing extremists , is scheduled to be put up for approval after the parliament 's summer recess . a " cookie monster " the proposals however have run into fierce opposition in some quarters . the government is acting like a " cookie monster , " said wolfgang wieland , speaker for domestic affairs of the left-leaning green party .
" they always want more , more , more and are never satisfied , " wieland told german news agency dpa . wieland is not alone in his criticism .
hans christian ströbele , a senior green party member , was a bitter opponent of the first set of anti-terror laws " because they amount to a gross violation of our democratic rights , first and foremost our right to privacy .
the new measures cap it all because they even expand these violations to even more sectors of the population . " max stadler from the free-market liberal free democrats argued that the laws are yet another step toward an orwellian surveillance system : " experience shows that once the door has been opened , the state encroaches further and further on our civil rights , " he said . " my worst fears are coming true , especially when you see that police duties are to be taken over by the secret services , which no one really controls in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ensslin and baader belonged to " red army fraction " in the 1970s history knows both sides germany has experience with both sides of the issue in its recent collective memory . on the one hand , the country experienced consequences of catastrophic proportions when nazi rightwing extremists gained a foothold in the 1930s .
and in the 1970s and 80s , terrorist groups like the " rote armee fraktion " -lrb- raf -rrb- were active .
but on the other hand , thousands of germans also experienced excessive state surveillance by the stasi or secret police in east germany . when the proposed revisions to the anti-terrorism laws go up for approval after the summer recess , german lawmakers will also have to align their decision with a may ruling from the country 's highest court that police profiling to find terrorists is unconstitutional . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in war on terror , how far is too far ?

lehmann impressed many with his performance between the posts during the tournament though he did n't have a chance of stopping the italian goals that sent germany out in the semi-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and the german team want klinsmann to stay on " i will think about my personal situation after the finals and certainly chat with jürgen klinsmann about it , " the 36-year-old told reporters on thursday , adding that he would like klinsmann to stay .

" if oliver wants to play and the coach is convinced then that would be fine by me , " lehmann said .
" he has been the model professional and worked hard in training .
he has been a great example and has definitely earned it . " kahn , known for his egotistical and often arrogant outbursts on and off the field , earned the respect of much of germany by embracing lehmann in a show of support before a quarter-final penalty shoot-out against argentina , in which lehmann blocked two shots .

the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .
in fact , after they leave school , only about one-half of them have the qualifications to begin an apprenticeship program . " the economy is the most important integration mechanism we have , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
" that 's why i ask that we take our responsibility in creating enough apprenticeships for young people very seriously , even in lower-skilled professions . " low-wage expansion according to him , the majority of young people with immigrant backgrounds will enter professions that are not in the highly skilled sector , but in sectors that require less training .
that is why he has called for reform in the country 's low-wage sector , since he says without the creation of additional jobs in this area , the threat of illegal work will only grow . still , creating more low-wage jobs runs contrary to what the economy is looking for in the future .
otto kenzler , present of the german confederation of skills crafts , says both industry and young people must be involved in bringing more skilled labor into the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people should start looking for trainee spots early " i can only advise young people to get in contact with companies early on , even during their time at school , " he said .
" the fact that they have a goal in front of them and a chance at an apprenticeship has help them considerably . " foreign-owned businesses just under 24 percent of german companies offer training program for young people , although only 15 percent of those companies with owners of foreign origin do .
that should change , according to nihat sorgec , director of the kreuzberg educational works , who works with many business owned by people of turkish origin . " in the meanwhile , there are more than 60,000 businesspeople of turkish origin in germany .
they employ more than 320,000 people and have annual sales of over 30 billion euros , " he said .
" according to estimates , that number will double in the next 10 to 15 years . " but statistics such as these are n't enough to meet the problem of a future lack of qualified personnel , according to dieter hundt .
he has called for a change in germany 's immigration policy .
he 'd like , for example , to link immigration to germany to qualifications such as education , work experience and language ability . " a rational immigration policy that is oriented toward the needs of the labor market can do a lot for overall economic dynamism and job creation , " he said . that is an opinion that the head of the munich-based institute of economic research , hans-werner sinn , shares .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.07.2006 iran resists pressure to respond on nuclear offer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks between larijani -lrb- left -rrb- and solana ended earlier this year without agreement iran dashed western hopes of a breakthrough in the nuclear crisis thursday , saying it has no plans to respond in talks in brussels to an international offer to curb its atomic plans . a senior iranian official made the comment hours before tehran 's top nuclear negotiator ali larijani was due to have dinner with european union foreign policy chief javier solana . " we will not give a response , " either wednesday evening or next tuesday , at a wider meeting of iranian officials with representatives of countries behind the international nuclear offer , the official told news agency afp .
" we are just resolving ambiguities " of the package of incentives being offered to the islamic republic , he added . leaders still hope iran will budge solana has said he expects a " first response " in the brussels talks on whether iran might be ready to suspend uranium enrichment in exchange for political and economic incentives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad still remains defiant but iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said that tehran will give its formal response to the offer in august . russian president vladimir putin called thursday for tehran to accelerate its efforts to respond to the international community .
" the iranian leadership said it is ready for dialogue and will answer by august , " putin said while answering questions sent in by internet from around the world .
" in our view they could have done this earlier . " solana 's spokeswoman cristina gallach downplayed the significance of the latest iranian comments .
" our intention remains the same : to begin to get as much information as possible on iran 's reaction ...
we are going to start working with him ... with the aim of having a substantial response next week , " she told afp . iran is facing mounting international pressure to show by next week that it is ready to accept the offer , with the threat of un security council action hanging over it . but iran , which denies it is trying to covertly build an atomic bomb behind the screen of a civilian nuclear programme , refuses categorically to suspend enrichment activities ; a key condition of the package . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice says the us is still waiting for iran to move on their offer " we still intend to have a substantive response from iran before the middle of july ... , " us secretary of state condoleezza rice said wednesday .
" it simply makes sense for the world to have some kind of indication of whether iran intends to pursue the negotiated track or not . " another meeting on iran leaders of the group of eight major industrial powers expect to examine iran 's response at a meeting in saint petersburg starting on july 15 , but , as in the past , iran has resisted all attempts to set a calendar . on wednesday , larijani tried to push back the brussels talks until next week , but solana said that " waiting another week was impossible " and " there had to be a contact before that " , according to gallach . thursday evening 's dinner comes ahead of more substantial talks in paris next tuesday , when representatives from the five permanent un security council members plus germany are expected to meet solana but not the iranian delegation , according to the eu diplomat 's office . the us state department also said that foreign ministers from the six world powers would meet to discuss iran the following day - wednesday - just before the g8 summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear plant in the central iranian city of isfahan in their offer , the six affirm iran 's right to develop nuclear energy , support its building of light-water reactors and provide for uranium enrichment to take place in russia . it would improve tehran 's access to international markets and capital and back its efforts to join the world trade organisation , among other incentives . in return , iran would suspend all enrichment-related activities , which have sparked fears it may be trying to build a nuclear weapon , and accept wider inspections by the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran dragging its feet over nuclear talks the eu is pressuring iran to accept a " very good package of incentives " in exchange for halting uranium enrichment before the g8 meeting of industrial nations on july 15 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.07.2006 singing berlin 's praises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holly and david barkhymer , contest winners in the run-up to the world cup , deutsche welle held a contest asking people to share their impressions of germany .
the winning entry came from a couple in new york city for their song , " the streets of berlin . " when david barkhymer suggested to his wife holly that they submit a song for the deutsche welle contest he 'd recently seen announced on the web site , she was more than a little skeptical . " i thought , they 're going to hate this idea , they do n't want a song " she said with a grimace .
" and then when we did end up submitting a song whose first lines talked about the grey berlin sky , i did n't think we had a chance . " the two new york city residents are telling this story from the deutsche welle offices in berlin , where they 've come as the contest 's grand-prize winners .
their song , which relates some of holly 's fond memories of her year spent in the german capital , beat hundreds of other entries sent in from around the globe . both holly , 33 , and david , 34 , consider themselves germanophiles , something holly said in her case developed long before she knew there was a name for it .
her best childhood friend had german parents , and as she grew older , she found she was attracted to german music , poetry and literature .
as she got to know contemporary germany better , she began to appreciate many aspects of life here . " i like germans ' concern for the environment and the country 's social safety net , " she said .
" and while you ca n't paint with too broad a brush , i think germans are a people who generally think things through .
it 's a pretty good place . " in a way , she has germany to thank for meeting her husband david , who also has a soft-spot for german movies , bands and soccer .
the two first met in a nightclub because david was wearing a shirt with the word polizei -lrb- police -rrb- on it .
that sparked holly 's interest and she struck up a conversation .
the two were married last october . city tour , sung to david , a special education teacher who plays guitar and bass , writing a song for the deutsche welle contest seemed like a natural for the couple .
holly , who does pr for the michael j. fox foundation , is a classically trained singer , and the two had been recording music in their apartment , mostly jazz standards , for several years . after holly agreed to the song idea , david wrote the guitar part and asked holly to write about berlin , where she 'd lived in the prenzlauer berg district from the summer of 1999 to the fall of 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tv tower , featured in the winning song " i fell in love with the energy of the place and i felt it was a time rich with possibilities , " she said .
" i was far from home and wanted to try things out . " their song is akin to a walk holly might have taken around the city then , listing off her favorite places : kreuzberg , the babylon cinema , the tiergarten park or iconic fernsehturm -lrb- tv tower -rrb- . while she does mention berlin 's heavy grey skies in her lyrics , she left out some other aspects that were difficult for her here , such as the notorious brusque manner of many native berliners .
" there were a few times back then when i was in tears , " she said . sites to see she and david said they were were thrilled to learn that deutsche welle was flying them to berlin for a week and plan to pack as much into their trip as possible .
they stayed with david 's brother , who teaches in wiesbaden , for a few days , where they were crushed by germany 's defeat by the italians in the world cup semi-finals .
now , they appear to have mostly bounced back , and want to hit as many sites in the capital as they can before flying home on sunday . one thing on the schedule is time spent in the beer gardens , where they plan on drinking their fair share of german beer ..
while they say new york city has everything , there are some things even the big apple ca n't guarantee 100 percent of the time . " when i was here , i could just go to any place around the corner and ask for a beer , " said holly .
" i would n't even know what i was getting , but i knew it 'd be delicious .

the winning entry came from a couple in new york city for their song , " the streets of berlin . " when david barkhymer suggested to his wife holly that they submit a song for the deutsche welle contest he 'd recently seen announced on the web site , she was more than a little skeptical . " i thought , they 're going to hate this idea , they do n't want a song " she said with a grimace .
" and then when we did end up submitting a song whose first lines talked about the grey berlin sky , i did n't think we had a chance . " the two new york city residents are telling this story from the deutsche welle offices in berlin , where they 've come as the contest 's grand-prize winners .
their song , which relates some of holly 's fond memories of her year spent in the german capital , beat hundreds of other entries sent in from around the globe . both holly , 33 , and david , 34 , consider themselves germanophiles , something holly said in her case developed long before she knew there was a name for it .
her best childhood friend had german parents , and as she grew older , she found she was attracted to german music , poetry and literature .
as she got to know contemporary germany better , she began to appreciate many aspects of life here . " i like germans ' concern for the environment and the country 's social safety net , " she said .
" and while you ca n't paint with too broad a brush , i think germans are a people who generally think things through .
it 's a pretty good place . " in a way , she has germany to thank for meeting her husband david , who also has a soft-spot for german movies , bands and soccer .

that sparked holly 's interest and she struck up a conversation .
the two were married last october . city tour , sung to david , a special education teacher who plays guitar and bass , writing a song for the deutsche welle contest seemed like a natural for the couple .
holly , who does pr for the michael j. fox foundation , is a classically trained singer , and the two had been recording music in their apartment , mostly jazz standards , for several years . after holly agreed to the song idea , david wrote the guitar part and asked holly to write about berlin , where she 'd lived in the prenzlauer berg district from the summer of 1999 to the fall of 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tv tower , featured in the winning song " i fell in love with the energy of the place and i felt it was a time rich with possibilities , " she said .
" i was far from home and wanted to try things out . " their song is akin to a walk holly might have taken around the city then , listing off her favorite places : kreuzberg , the babylon cinema , the tiergarten park or iconic fernsehturm -lrb- tv tower -rrb- . while she does mention berlin 's heavy grey skies in her lyrics , she left out some other aspects that were difficult for her here , such as the notorious brusque manner of many native berliners .
" there were a few times back then when i was in tears , " she said . sites to see she and david said they were were thrilled to learn that deutsche welle was flying them to berlin for a week and plan to pack as much into their trip as possible .

the winning entry came from a couple in new york city for their song , " the streets of berlin . " when david barkhymer suggested to his wife holly that they submit a song for the deutsche welle contest he 'd recently seen announced on the web site , she was more than a little skeptical . " i thought , they 're going to hate this idea , they do n't want a song " she said with a grimace .
" and then when we did end up submitting a song whose first lines talked about the grey berlin sky , i did n't think we had a chance . " the two new york city residents are telling this story from the deutsche welle offices in berlin , where they 've come as the contest 's grand-prize winners .
their song , which relates some of holly 's fond memories of her year spent in the german capital , beat hundreds of other entries sent in from around the globe . both holly , 33 , and david , 34 , consider themselves germanophiles , something holly said in her case developed long before she knew there was a name for it .
her best childhood friend had german parents , and as she grew older , she found she was attracted to german music , poetry and literature .
as she got to know contemporary germany better , she began to appreciate many aspects of life here . " i like germans ' concern for the environment and the country 's social safety net , " she said .
" and while you ca n't paint with too broad a brush , i think germans are a people who generally think things through .

that sparked holly 's interest and she struck up a conversation .
the two were married last october . city tour , sung to david , a special education teacher who plays guitar and bass , writing a song for the deutsche welle contest seemed like a natural for the couple .
holly , who does pr for the michael j. fox foundation , is a classically trained singer , and the two had been recording music in their apartment , mostly jazz standards , for several years . after holly agreed to the song idea , david wrote the guitar part and asked holly to write about berlin , where she 'd lived in the prenzlauer berg district from the summer of 1999 to the fall of 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tv tower , featured in the winning song " i fell in love with the energy of the place and i felt it was a time rich with possibilities , " she said .
" i was far from home and wanted to try things out . " their song is akin to a walk holly might have taken around the city then , listing off her favorite places : kreuzberg , the babylon cinema , the tiergarten park or iconic fernsehturm -lrb- tv tower -rrb- . while she does mention berlin 's heavy grey skies in her lyrics , she left out some other aspects that were difficult for her here , such as the notorious brusque manner of many native berliners .
" there were a few times back then when i was in tears , " she said . sites to see she and david said they were were thrilled to learn that deutsche welle was flying them to berlin for a week and plan to pack as much into their trip as possible .

the german parliament agreed this week not only to extend the anti-terror laws passed in early 2001 , but to make them more stringent .
advocates of civil liberties are outraged . in the wake of september 11 , german law makers passed a series of anti-terror laws that are due to expire at the end of the year .
this week , germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats agreed on proposals that would not only extend the controversial laws but make them even tougher . " so far , scans of information databases have only been allowed in connection with terror suspects , " explained stefan kalle , spokesman for the ministry of the interior .
" it is now planned to extend this to include rightwing extremists and militant islamists such as hate preachers operating in germany . " broader investigating power for police the existing laws , which went into effect in early 2002 , allow police and secret services to use telephone communications , emails , faxes , bank accounts and travel data as sources of information .

but on the other hand , thousands of germans also experienced excessive state surveillance by the stasi or secret police in east germany . when the proposed revisions to the anti-terrorism laws go up for approval after the summer recess , german lawmakers will also have to align their decision with a may ruling from the country 's highest court that police profiling to find terrorists is unconstitutional . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in war on terror , how far is too far ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.07.2006 singing berlin 's praises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holly and david barkhymer , contest winners in the run-up to the world cup , deutsche welle held a contest asking people to share their impressions of germany .
the winning entry came from a couple in new york city for their song , " the streets of berlin . " when david barkhymer suggested to his wife holly that they submit a song for the deutsche welle contest he 'd recently seen announced on the web site , she was more than a little skeptical . " i thought , they 're going to hate this idea , they do n't want a song " she said with a grimace .
" and then when we did end up submitting a song whose first lines talked about the grey berlin sky , i did n't think we had a chance . " the two new york city residents are telling this story from the deutsche welle offices in berlin , where they 've come as the contest 's grand-prize winners .
their song , which relates some of holly 's fond memories of her year spent in the german capital , beat hundreds of other entries sent in from around the globe . both holly , 33 , and david , 34 , consider themselves germanophiles , something holly said in her case developed long before she knew there was a name for it .
her best childhood friend had german parents , and as she grew older , she found she was attracted to german music , poetry and literature .
as she got to know contemporary germany better , she began to appreciate many aspects of life here . " i like germans ' concern for the environment and the country 's social safety net , " she said .
" and while you ca n't paint with too broad a brush , i think germans are a people who generally think things through .
it 's a pretty good place . " in a way , she has germany to thank for meeting her husband david , who also has a soft-spot for german movies , bands and soccer .
the two first met in a nightclub because david was wearing a shirt with the word polizei -lrb- police -rrb- on it .
that sparked holly 's interest and she struck up a conversation .
the two were married last october . city tour , sung to david , a special education teacher who plays guitar and bass , writing a song for the deutsche welle contest seemed like a natural for the couple .
holly , who does pr for the michael j. fox foundation , is a classically trained singer , and the two had been recording music in their apartment , mostly jazz standards , for several years . after holly agreed to the song idea , david wrote the guitar part and asked holly to write about berlin , where she 'd lived in the prenzlauer berg district from the summer of 1999 to the fall of 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tv tower , featured in the winning song " i fell in love with the energy of the place and i felt it was a time rich with possibilities , " she said .
" i was far from home and wanted to try things out . " their song is akin to a walk holly might have taken around the city then , listing off her favorite places : kreuzberg , the babylon cinema , the tiergarten park or iconic fernsehturm -lrb- tv tower -rrb- . while she does mention berlin 's heavy grey skies in her lyrics , she left out some other aspects that were difficult for her here , such as the notorious brusque manner of many native berliners .
" there were a few times back then when i was in tears , " she said . sites to see she and david said they were were thrilled to learn that deutsche welle was flying them to berlin for a week and plan to pack as much into their trip as possible .
they stayed with david 's brother , who teaches in wiesbaden , for a few days , where they were crushed by germany 's defeat by the italians in the world cup semi-finals .
now , they appear to have mostly bounced back , and want to hit as many sites in the capital as they can before flying home on sunday . one thing on the schedule is time spent in the beer gardens , where they plan on drinking their fair share of german beer ..
while they say new york city has everything , there are some things even the big apple ca n't guarantee 100 percent of the time . " when i was here , i could just go to any place around the corner and ask for a beer , " said holly .
" i would n't even know what i was getting , but i knew it 'd be delicious .

the winning entry came from a couple in new york city for their song , " the streets of berlin . " when david barkhymer suggested to his wife holly that they submit a song for the deutsche welle contest he 'd recently seen announced on the web site , she was more than a little skeptical . " i thought , they 're going to hate this idea , they do n't want a song " she said with a grimace .
" and then when we did end up submitting a song whose first lines talked about the grey berlin sky , i did n't think we had a chance . " the two new york city residents are telling this story from the deutsche welle offices in berlin , where they 've come as the contest 's grand-prize winners .
their song , which relates some of holly 's fond memories of her year spent in the german capital , beat hundreds of other entries sent in from around the globe . both holly , 33 , and david , 34 , consider themselves germanophiles , something holly said in her case developed long before she knew there was a name for it .
her best childhood friend had german parents , and as she grew older , she found she was attracted to german music , poetry and literature .
as she got to know contemporary germany better , she began to appreciate many aspects of life here . " i like germans ' concern for the environment and the country 's social safety net , " she said .
" and while you ca n't paint with too broad a brush , i think germans are a people who generally think things through .
it 's a pretty good place . " in a way , she has germany to thank for meeting her husband david , who also has a soft-spot for german movies , bands and soccer .
the two first met in a nightclub because david was wearing a shirt with the word polizei -lrb- police -rrb- on it .
that sparked holly 's interest and she struck up a conversation .
the two were married last october . city tour , sung to david , a special education teacher who plays guitar and bass , writing a song for the deutsche welle contest seemed like a natural for the couple .
holly , who does pr for the michael j. fox foundation , is a classically trained singer , and the two had been recording music in their apartment , mostly jazz standards , for several years . after holly agreed to the song idea , david wrote the guitar part and asked holly to write about berlin , where she 'd lived in the prenzlauer berg district from the summer of 1999 to the fall of 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tv tower , featured in the winning song " i fell in love with the energy of the place and i felt it was a time rich with possibilities , " she said .
" i was far from home and wanted to try things out . " their song is akin to a walk holly might have taken around the city then , listing off her favorite places : kreuzberg , the babylon cinema , the tiergarten park or iconic fernsehturm -lrb- tv tower -rrb- . while she does mention berlin 's heavy grey skies in her lyrics , she left out some other aspects that were difficult for her here , such as the notorious brusque manner of many native berliners .
" there were a few times back then when i was in tears , " she said . sites to see she and david said they were were thrilled to learn that deutsche welle was flying them to berlin for a week and plan to pack as much into their trip as possible .
they stayed with david 's brother , who teaches in wiesbaden , for a few days , where they were crushed by germany 's defeat by the italians in the world cup semi-finals .
now , they appear to have mostly bounced back , and want to hit as many sites in the capital as they can before flying home on sunday . one thing on the schedule is time spent in the beer gardens , where they plan on drinking their fair share of german beer ..
while they say new york city has everything , there are some things even the big apple ca n't guarantee 100 percent of the time . " when i was here , i could just go to any place around the corner and ask for a beer , " said holly .
" i would n't even know what i was getting , but i knew it 'd be delicious .

the german parliament agreed this week not only to extend the anti-terror laws passed in early 2001 , but to make them more stringent .
advocates of civil liberties are outraged . in the wake of september 11 , german law makers passed a series of anti-terror laws that are due to expire at the end of the year .
this week , germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats agreed on proposals that would not only extend the controversial laws but make them even tougher . " so far , scans of information databases have only been allowed in connection with terror suspects , " explained stefan kalle , spokesman for the ministry of the interior .
" it is now planned to extend this to include rightwing extremists and militant islamists such as hate preachers operating in germany . " broader investigating power for police the existing laws , which went into effect in early 2002 , allow police and secret services to use telephone communications , emails , faxes , bank accounts and travel data as sources of information .
under the proposed revisions , access to the same would be expanded .
in addition , germany 's foreign intelligence service , bnd would have wider access to domestic police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german stasi had a file on nearly everyone until now , the anti-terror laws have been implemented in terror suspect cases .
if approved , the new laws would be broadened to include possible consequences for individuals who may belong to extremist organizations but are not suspected of terror crimes . the proposal , intended to help combat islamic fundamentalists as well as rightwing extremists , is scheduled to be put up for approval after the parliament 's summer recess . a " cookie monster " the proposals however have run into fierce opposition in some quarters . the government is acting like a " cookie monster , " said wolfgang wieland , speaker for domestic affairs of the left-leaning green party .
" they always want more , more , more and are never satisfied , " wieland told german news agency dpa . wieland is not alone in his criticism .
hans christian ströbele , a senior green party member , was a bitter opponent of the first set of anti-terror laws " because they amount to a gross violation of our democratic rights , first and foremost our right to privacy .
the new measures cap it all because they even expand these violations to even more sectors of the population . " max stadler from the free-market liberal free democrats argued that the laws are yet another step toward an orwellian surveillance system : " experience shows that once the door has been opened , the state encroaches further and further on our civil rights , " he said . " my worst fears are coming true , especially when you see that police duties are to be taken over by the secret services , which no one really controls in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ensslin and baader belonged to " red army fraction " in the 1970s history knows both sides germany has experience with both sides of the issue in its recent collective memory . on the one hand , the country experienced consequences of catastrophic proportions when nazi rightwing extremists gained a foothold in the 1930s .
and in the 1970s and 80s , terrorist groups like the " rote armee fraktion " -lrb- raf -rrb- were active .
but on the other hand , thousands of germans also experienced excessive state surveillance by the stasi or secret police in east germany . when the proposed revisions to the anti-terrorism laws go up for approval after the summer recess , german lawmakers will also have to align their decision with a may ruling from the country 's highest court that police profiling to find terrorists is unconstitutional . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in war on terror , how far is too far ?

stralsunders who live in the historic district will not be allowed to open their windows or leave their apartments from 9:30 am until 16 minutes after the end of the visit . laura bush may end up having no choice but to sit around and twiddle her thumbs while george w. and angela merkel hold their talks . hunting for the president despite the planned protests , some stralsunders are actually looking forward to the presidential visit .
stralsund 's hotel royal , for example , is throwing an american barbecue party the night before bush 's arrival with country music and cowboy dancers . " the visit of the most powerful politician is a huge boost for the image of stralsund , " said hotel manager sebastian tacke .
" that has to be celebrated accordingly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : please , do n't shoot !
merkel and the bushes will themselves attend a different barbecue , one hosted by olaf micheel , an innkeeper from neighboring trinwillershagen .
in a bow to the manly , alpha-animal texan , micheel is planning to roast a wild boar that he has shot himself .
the only problem is that he has n't found one yet .
but he 's out there with a gun , looking .
a local radio station is dutifully following the hunt for the president 's boar . " we could never pay for this kind of advertising , " said micheel .
" this is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity . " micheel is convinced that the american president will feel at home in his tiny village between stralsund and rostock . " it 's like being on a ranch here , " micheel said . tastes like fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's something really fishy about traditional german recipes the local fishmonger henry rasmus will present the american president with a box of bismarck herring - the only fish in the world officially allowed to carry the noble name of germany 's greatest 19th century statesman .
rasmus bought the rights to the original recipe for marinated herring from the descendants of johann wiechmann , who served it first in 1871 to the mighty otto von bismarck , the iron chancellor . when all is said and done , angela merkel will probably breathe a sigh of relief to see george dubya 's back .
though she may get a slight headache arguing with the local government of mecklenburg - western pomerania about who 's going to foot the 12 million euro -lrb- $ 14.3 million -rrb- bill to cover the expenses of the us president 's visit . which is , if you think about it , quite pricey for two days of pure stress and a wild boar barbecue . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in greifswald , lady liberty lifts a finger what happens when a high-level diplomatic visit clashes with a politically charged musical production ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.07.2006 german parliament seeks to tighten anti-terror laws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in war against terror , how far is too far ?
the german parliament agreed this week not only to extend the anti-terror laws passed in early 2001 , but to make them more stringent .
advocates of civil liberties are outraged . in the wake of september 11 , german law makers passed a series of anti-terror laws that are due to expire at the end of the year .
this week , germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats agreed on proposals that would not only extend the controversial laws but make them even tougher . " so far , scans of information databases have only been allowed in connection with terror suspects , " explained stefan kalle , spokesman for the ministry of the interior .
" it is now planned to extend this to include rightwing extremists and militant islamists such as hate preachers operating in germany . " broader investigating power for police the existing laws , which went into effect in early 2002 , allow police and secret services to use telephone communications , emails , faxes , bank accounts and travel data as sources of information .
under the proposed revisions , access to the same would be expanded .
in addition , germany 's foreign intelligence service , bnd would have wider access to domestic police databases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german stasi had a file on nearly everyone until now , the anti-terror laws have been implemented in terror suspect cases .
if approved , the new laws would be broadened to include possible consequences for individuals who may belong to extremist organizations but are not suspected of terror crimes . the proposal , intended to help combat islamic fundamentalists as well as rightwing extremists , is scheduled to be put up for approval after the parliament 's summer recess . a " cookie monster " the proposals however have run into fierce opposition in some quarters . the government is acting like a " cookie monster , " said wolfgang wieland , speaker for domestic affairs of the left-leaning green party .
" they always want more , more , more and are never satisfied , " wieland told german news agency dpa . wieland is not alone in his criticism .
hans christian ströbele , a senior green party member , was a bitter opponent of the first set of anti-terror laws " because they amount to a gross violation of our democratic rights , first and foremost our right to privacy .
the new measures cap it all because they even expand these violations to even more sectors of the population . " max stadler from the free-market liberal free democrats argued that the laws are yet another step toward an orwellian surveillance system : " experience shows that once the door has been opened , the state encroaches further and further on our civil rights , " he said . " my worst fears are coming true , especially when you see that police duties are to be taken over by the secret services , which no one really controls in this country . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ensslin and baader belonged to " red army fraction " in the 1970s history knows both sides germany has experience with both sides of the issue in its recent collective memory . on the one hand , the country experienced consequences of catastrophic proportions when nazi rightwing extremists gained a foothold in the 1930s .
and in the 1970s and 80s , terrorist groups like the " rote armee fraktion " -lrb- raf -rrb- were active .
but on the other hand , thousands of germans also experienced excessive state surveillance by the stasi or secret police in east germany . when the proposed revisions to the anti-terrorism laws go up for approval after the summer recess , german lawmakers will also have to align their decision with a may ruling from the country 's highest court that police profiling to find terrorists is unconstitutional . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in war on terror , how far is too far ?

the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .
in fact , after they leave school , only about one-half of them have the qualifications to begin an apprenticeship program . " the economy is the most important integration mechanism we have , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
" that 's why i ask that we take our responsibility in creating enough apprenticeships for young people very seriously , even in lower-skilled professions . " low-wage expansion according to him , the majority of young people with immigrant backgrounds will enter professions that are not in the highly skilled sector , but in sectors that require less training .
that is why he has called for reform in the country 's low-wage sector , since he says without the creation of additional jobs in this area , the threat of illegal work will only grow . still , creating more low-wage jobs runs contrary to what the economy is looking for in the future .
otto kenzler , present of the german confederation of skills crafts , says both industry and young people must be involved in bringing more skilled labor into the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people should start looking for trainee spots early " i can only advise young people to get in contact with companies early on , even during their time at school , " he said .
" the fact that they have a goal in front of them and a chance at an apprenticeship has help them considerably . " foreign-owned businesses just under 24 percent of german companies offer training program for young people , although only 15 percent of those companies with owners of foreign origin do .
that should change , according to nihat sorgec , director of the kreuzberg educational works , who works with many business owned by people of turkish origin . " in the meanwhile , there are more than 60,000 businesspeople of turkish origin in germany .
they employ more than 320,000 people and have annual sales of over 30 billion euros , " he said .
" according to estimates , that number will double in the next 10 to 15 years . " but statistics such as these are n't enough to meet the problem of a future lack of qualified personnel , according to dieter hundt .
he has called for a change in germany 's immigration policy .
he 'd like , for example , to link immigration to germany to qualifications such as education , work experience and language ability . " a rational immigration policy that is oriented toward the needs of the labor market can do a lot for overall economic dynamism and job creation , " he said . that is an opinion that the head of the munich-based institute of economic research , hans-werner sinn , shares .

the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .

he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .
in fact , after they leave school , only about one-half of them have the qualifications to begin an apprenticeship program . " the economy is the most important integration mechanism we have , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .

he may , in fact , end up leaving the country thinking germany is n't so different from texas , after all . having george w. bush come over for a visit is an incredibly stressful affair for any foreign government official . first of all , there 's the issue of the president 's tough cowboy talk which usually makes most foreigners - even the occasionally overeducated head of state - rather insecure about their knowledge of english . when george dubya pronounces " america , " for example , it usually comes out as " amur-cah " or " mur-cah . "
that 's a little strange for somebody who grew up in midland , texas , but left it at the age of 15 to follow the typical path of a member of the lucky sperm club : prep school at andover , college at yale and graduate school at harvard .
george w. proudly uses his theatrical texan twang - not shared by his parents or siblings - to declare his chosen identity .
it is like his own pair of stylish cowboy boots that nobody will ever be able to rob him of . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are big fans of the us president then , there is the ever-embarrassing issue of the tireless , bush-whacking protestors .
luckily for the stressed-out hosts , the police usually sequester the demonstrators as far away from the us president as possible : see-no-evil , hear-no-evil is the best way to avoid embarrassment while playing the usual round of diplomatic charades and stressing improved bilateral relations .
as a consequence , mr. bush probably thinks that european cities are kind of lonely .
hey , condi , where did all the people go ? angie and george bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stralsund is known for its architecture on july 13 and 14 , german chancellor angela merkel will be the overstressed host trying to keep her composure when she welcomes george w. and first lady laura bush at her constituency , stralsund - a beautiful historic sea town of 60,000 in the north-eastern part of the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . during all the handshaking , the smiling and the joking that usually goes on in front of the journalists when the american president is around , members of the association " not welcome , mr. president " will be staging their protest on the outskirts of stralsund .
the downtown historic district , where bush will be hanging out , has been declared a no-protest zone . " in our talks with the police and the city , we will try to make sure we get as close as possible , both in terms of the location and the time , to the events , " said monty schädel , one of the protest organizers . ladies first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura bush will practically have nothing to do according to officials in berlin , a small special " damenprogramm " -lrb- program for ladies -rrb- has been planned for laura bush , but no details are available yet .
which is quite understandable : berlin officials in charge of the protocol are probably banging their heads against the walls of the chancellery right now .
" where , oh where , are we going to send her ? " they ask themselves . the town will be , after all , completely paralyzed during the visit .
municipal agencies and offices will be closed .
no shops will be open .
entering the town 's historic central district will be possible only through one of two check points .
the library , the museum , the adult education center and the music school will also close their doors .
stralsunders who live in the historic district will not be allowed to open their windows or leave their apartments from 9:30 am until 16 minutes after the end of the visit . laura bush may end up having no choice but to sit around and twiddle her thumbs while george w. and angela merkel hold their talks . hunting for the president despite the planned protests , some stralsunders are actually looking forward to the presidential visit .
stralsund 's hotel royal , for example , is throwing an american barbecue party the night before bush 's arrival with country music and cowboy dancers . " the visit of the most powerful politician is a huge boost for the image of stralsund , " said hotel manager sebastian tacke .
" that has to be celebrated accordingly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : please , do n't shoot !
merkel and the bushes will themselves attend a different barbecue , one hosted by olaf micheel , an innkeeper from neighboring trinwillershagen .
in a bow to the manly , alpha-animal texan , micheel is planning to roast a wild boar that he has shot himself .
the only problem is that he has n't found one yet .
but he 's out there with a gun , looking .
a local radio station is dutifully following the hunt for the president 's boar . " we could never pay for this kind of advertising , " said micheel .
" this is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity . " micheel is convinced that the american president will feel at home in his tiny village between stralsund and rostock . " it 's like being on a ranch here , " micheel said . tastes like fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's something really fishy about traditional german recipes the local fishmonger henry rasmus will present the american president with a box of bismarck herring - the only fish in the world officially allowed to carry the noble name of germany 's greatest 19th century statesman .
rasmus bought the rights to the original recipe for marinated herring from the descendants of johann wiechmann , who served it first in 1871 to the mighty otto von bismarck , the iron chancellor . when all is said and done , angela merkel will probably breathe a sigh of relief to see george dubya 's back .
though she may get a slight headache arguing with the local government of mecklenburg - western pomerania about who 's going to foot the 12 million euro -lrb- $ 14.3 million -rrb- bill to cover the expenses of the us president 's visit . which is , if you think about it , quite pricey for two days of pure stress and a wild boar barbecue . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in greifswald , lady liberty lifts a finger what happens when a high-level diplomatic visit clashes with a politically charged musical production ?

the german parliament agreed this week not only to extend the anti-terror laws passed in early 2001 , but to make them more stringent .
advocates of civil liberties are outraged . in the wake of september 11 , german law makers passed a series of anti-terror laws that are due to expire at the end of the year .
this week , germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and social democrats agreed on proposals that would not only extend the controversial laws but make them even tougher . " so far , scans of information databases have only been allowed in connection with terror suspects , " explained stefan kalle , spokesman for the ministry of the interior .
" it is now planned to extend this to include rightwing extremists and militant islamists such as hate preachers operating in germany . " broader investigating power for police the existing laws , which went into effect in early 2002 , allow police and secret services to use telephone communications , emails , faxes , bank accounts and travel data as sources of information .

" max stadler from the free-market liberal free democrats argued that the laws are yet another step toward an orwellian surveillance system : " experience shows that once the door has been opened , the state encroaches further and further on our civil rights , " he said .

he also said he 'd move over for oliver kahn in saturday 's match for third place . after his first major tournament in net for germany , lehmann said whether he stays with the national team until euro 2008 largely depends on klinsmann continuing to coach the young team he put together for the 2006 world cup . it was klinsmann who chose to start lehmann over former germany captain kahn .
lehmann impressed many with his performance between the posts during the tournament though he did n't have a chance of stopping the italian goals that sent germany out in the semi-finals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and the german team want klinsmann to stay on " i will think about my personal situation after the finals and certainly chat with jürgen klinsmann about it , " the 36-year-old told reporters on thursday , adding that he would like klinsmann to stay .
" if jürgen decides that he does not want to continue , the disappointment would be enormous as we do not know what is coming next . " lehmann , who looked slightly despondent at the press conference , admitted he was finding the italy defeat hard to swallow . " the disappointment of going so close to winning two major trophies this season will stay with me for a long time , " he said , referring to losing the champions league with his club team , arsenal , before reaching the final .
" as a player it is difficult to stomach missing out on the final . " making way for king kahn missing out on the final was likely to have been equally difficult for former germany starter kahn , who has n't played at all during the 2006 tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn earned respect from germany for his sportsmanship during the world cup the 37-year-old ended up on the short end of an extended duel with lehmann for the number 1 spot , but may get a chance to say goodbye to international soccer by starting in saturday 's match for third place against portugal . " if oliver wants to play and the coach is convinced then that would be fine by me , " lehmann said .
" he has been the model professional and worked hard in training .
he has been a great example and has definitely earned it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 06.07.2006 wild boar barbecue for mr. & mrs. bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she thinks he 's funny : german chancellor angela merkel and us president george w. bush when george w. bush comes to germany next week , he 'll get to enjoy , among other things , a wild boar barbecue .
he may , in fact , end up leaving the country thinking germany is n't so different from texas , after all . having george w. bush come over for a visit is an incredibly stressful affair for any foreign government official . first of all , there 's the issue of the president 's tough cowboy talk which usually makes most foreigners - even the occasionally overeducated head of state - rather insecure about their knowledge of english . when george dubya pronounces " america , " for example , it usually comes out as " amur-cah " or " mur-cah . "
that 's a little strange for somebody who grew up in midland , texas , but left it at the age of 15 to follow the typical path of a member of the lucky sperm club : prep school at andover , college at yale and graduate school at harvard .
george w. proudly uses his theatrical texan twang - not shared by his parents or siblings - to declare his chosen identity .
it is like his own pair of stylish cowboy boots that nobody will ever be able to rob him of . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are big fans of the us president then , there is the ever-embarrassing issue of the tireless , bush-whacking protestors .
luckily for the stressed-out hosts , the police usually sequester the demonstrators as far away from the us president as possible : see-no-evil , hear-no-evil is the best way to avoid embarrassment while playing the usual round of diplomatic charades and stressing improved bilateral relations .
as a consequence , mr. bush probably thinks that european cities are kind of lonely .
hey , condi , where did all the people go ? angie and george bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stralsund is known for its architecture on july 13 and 14 , german chancellor angela merkel will be the overstressed host trying to keep her composure when she welcomes george w. and first lady laura bush at her constituency , stralsund - a beautiful historic sea town of 60,000 in the north-eastern part of the german state of mecklenburg-western pomerania . during all the handshaking , the smiling and the joking that usually goes on in front of the journalists when the american president is around , members of the association " not welcome , mr. president " will be staging their protest on the outskirts of stralsund .
the downtown historic district , where bush will be hanging out , has been declared a no-protest zone . " in our talks with the police and the city , we will try to make sure we get as close as possible , both in terms of the location and the time , to the events , " said monty schädel , one of the protest organizers . ladies first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laura bush will practically have nothing to do according to officials in berlin , a small special " damenprogramm " -lrb- program for ladies -rrb- has been planned for laura bush , but no details are available yet .
which is quite understandable : berlin officials in charge of the protocol are probably banging their heads against the walls of the chancellery right now .
" where , oh where , are we going to send her ? " they ask themselves . the town will be , after all , completely paralyzed during the visit .
municipal agencies and offices will be closed .
no shops will be open .
entering the town 's historic central district will be possible only through one of two check points .
the library , the museum , the adult education center and the music school will also close their doors .
stralsunders who live in the historic district will not be allowed to open their windows or leave their apartments from 9:30 am until 16 minutes after the end of the visit . laura bush may end up having no choice but to sit around and twiddle her thumbs while george w. and angela merkel hold their talks . hunting for the president despite the planned protests , some stralsunders are actually looking forward to the presidential visit .
stralsund 's hotel royal , for example , is throwing an american barbecue party the night before bush 's arrival with country music and cowboy dancers . " the visit of the most powerful politician is a huge boost for the image of stralsund , " said hotel manager sebastian tacke .
" that has to be celebrated accordingly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : please , do n't shoot !
merkel and the bushes will themselves attend a different barbecue , one hosted by olaf micheel , an innkeeper from neighboring trinwillershagen .
in a bow to the manly , alpha-animal texan , micheel is planning to roast a wild boar that he has shot himself .
the only problem is that he has n't found one yet .
but he 's out there with a gun , looking .
a local radio station is dutifully following the hunt for the president 's boar . " we could never pay for this kind of advertising , " said micheel .
" this is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity . " micheel is convinced that the american president will feel at home in his tiny village between stralsund and rostock . " it 's like being on a ranch here , " micheel said . tastes like fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's something really fishy about traditional german recipes the local fishmonger henry rasmus will present the american president with a box of bismarck herring - the only fish in the world officially allowed to carry the noble name of germany 's greatest 19th century statesman .
rasmus bought the rights to the original recipe for marinated herring from the descendants of johann wiechmann , who served it first in 1871 to the mighty otto von bismarck , the iron chancellor . when all is said and done , angela merkel will probably breathe a sigh of relief to see george dubya 's back .
though she may get a slight headache arguing with the local government of mecklenburg - western pomerania about who 's going to foot the 12 million euro -lrb- $ 14.3 million -rrb- bill to cover the expenses of the us president 's visit . which is , if you think about it , quite pricey for two days of pure stress and a wild boar barbecue . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in greifswald , lady liberty lifts a finger what happens when a high-level diplomatic visit clashes with a politically charged musical production ?

the german economy is suffering from a shortage of skilled labor , something business leaders have warned of for years .
now they 're calling for far-reaching policy reform to bring more skilled workers into the country . executives have long complained that the german educational system is doing a poor job in preparing the country 's future work force .
business leaders say too many low-skilled workers are coming out of german schools , along with too few specialists and academics .
the country 's demographic developments promise to make the problem only worse since the number of employed people is expected to shrink by some 10 million by 2050 . add to this the latest statistics on migration , which on thursday revealed that the numbers of immigrants coming to germany are at their lowest level since reunification in 1990 . only 580,000 immigrants came to germany last year , 4 percent less than the previous year .
conversely , more germans emigrated or left the country , many of them skilled workers or professionals . dieter hundt , head of the confederation of german employers ' association , has been especially critical of german schools and says if skilled workers can not be found among germans , the nation needs to start looking at workers of foreign origin to ensure germany 's economic future . " the successful integration of immigrants into our society is a decisive pillar that affects the future innovation potential of our country , " he said . poor record but the integration of millions of immigrants has , thus far , not been very successful , a fact that a glance at the labor market makes clear , according to jutta allmendinger , director of the institute of labor market and occupational research .
around 40 percent of people with immigrant backgrounds in germany lack a basic high school diploma or any kind of occupational training . " so it should n't surprise us that the level of unemployment among people with immigrant backgrounds is higher , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt for hundt , the high rate of unemployment among this group is proof that germany 's immigration policies have failed , and are n't designed to meet the country 's needs .
he says children from immigrant families are not supported enough and the potential of millions of people in the country is being wasted . " in an open society and a globally organized economy , we need intercultural expertise , " he said .
" that 's why it is important that immigrant children speak german and their native language well . " but that is wishful thinking , since the large majority of immigrant children are far from that goal .
in fact , after they leave school , only about one-half of them have the qualifications to begin an apprenticeship program . " the economy is the most important integration mechanism we have , " said german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
" that 's why i ask that we take our responsibility in creating enough apprenticeships for young people very seriously , even in lower-skilled professions . " low-wage expansion according to him , the majority of young people with immigrant backgrounds will enter professions that are not in the highly skilled sector , but in sectors that require less training .
that is why he has called for reform in the country 's low-wage sector , since he says without the creation of additional jobs in this area , the threat of illegal work will only grow . still , creating more low-wage jobs runs contrary to what the economy is looking for in the future .
otto kenzler , present of the german confederation of skills crafts , says both industry and young people must be involved in bringing more skilled labor into the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people should start looking for trainee spots early " i can only advise young people to get in contact with companies early on , even during their time at school , " he said .
" the fact that they have a goal in front of them and a chance at an apprenticeship has help them considerably . " foreign-owned businesses just under 24 percent of german companies offer training program for young people , although only 15 percent of those companies with owners of foreign origin do .
that should change , according to nihat sorgec , director of the kreuzberg educational works , who works with many business owned by people of turkish origin . " in the meanwhile , there are more than 60,000 businesspeople of turkish origin in germany .
they employ more than 320,000 people and have annual sales of over 30 billion euros , " he said .
" according to estimates , that number will double in the next 10 to 15 years . " but statistics such as these are n't enough to meet the problem of a future lack of qualified personnel , according to dieter hundt .
he has called for a change in germany 's immigration policy .
he 'd like , for example , to link immigration to germany to qualifications such as education , work experience and language ability . " a rational immigration policy that is oriented toward the needs of the labor market can do a lot for overall economic dynamism and job creation , " he said . that is an opinion that the head of the munich-based institute of economic research , hans-werner sinn , shares .

" we have so far not seen any marked increase in human trafficking from eastern european countries to germany during the world cup , " swedish iom spokesman fredric larsson told the afp news agency . german police confirmed that prostitution , which has been legal in germany since 2002 , did not rise considerably during the month-long soccer tournament . " before the world cup there were rumors circulating about a large rush of prostitutes , " cologne city spokesman jürgen müllenberg said .
" but neither legal nor illegal prostitution has significantly risen .

" it 's going pretty slowly , unfortunately , " sabine strauss told the dpa news agency .
she runs an internet site where women can offer their services . munich , where 300 prostitutes joined the 500 already working there , was the only german city to register an increase during the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a campaign to end forced prostitution has been successful anti-trafficking campaigns worked larsson put strauss 's lack of business down to the success of a large-scale campaign to raise awareness of trafficking and forced prostitution before the world cup began . " the campaign has had a positive effect , " he said .
" it shows we do not need to accept trafficking . " pressure from the european union , united states and church groups led to more police raids on sex shops and brothels , which also helped keep legal and illegal prostitution down , according to the report . the preliminary study 's results were based on reports from european police as well as over 20 organizations that work against human trafficking in germany and eastern europe .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . doping tests at the world cup ? as a soccer fan who does not know too much about soccer , i have made the following observation pertaining to the italian team .
against the usa , they were slow and played a mediocre game .
throughout the cup , the italians were very inconsistent , contrary to the german team who maintained their style and great performance .
having seen the italians come to life for the first time in the game against germany , i can not help but wonder , what exactly happened to cause such a turn-around in performance ?
though i have seen many sports events in the usa , i have never seen a team that has displayed such an improvement as the italians did .
in the usa , this sudden change in performance would be suspect and subject to testing -lrb- dope -rrb- .
does the fifa also test during the world cup ?
just curious .

i did , and never looked back .
i watched all the teams during the cup , but the one that stuck with me was germany .
people all around me were putting them down and criticising them , even before their first game .
but then they gave everything they had , and when their fans cheered louder ballack and his crew fought harder .

what a game !
in my opinion , the world came to a complete standstill until the first goal was made !
it will be the game talked about for years !
it does n't matter who won or lost , that 's in the score book .
what really matters is the determination from both teams that gave the world an event that will be remembered beyond our lifetimes .
both countries have something to be proud of , regardless who won and who lost .

so cheer up and enjoy ... there 's will always be a next time . - m.l. cole come on germany , do not grieve for more than 10 minutes over your loss to italy .

the himalayan pass of nathu la , 4,000m -lrb- 14,000 feet -rrb- above sea level , was once part of the ancient silk road and saw clashes between the sides in the 1960s .
the opening ceremony took place at the windswept border between the indian state of sikkim and tibet .
nathu la has opened just a few days after the first train service was launched from eastern china to tibet .
the pass was given a festive look with chinese and indian flags fluttering and military bands playing .
china 's ambassador to india and local officials from sikkim and tibet attended the opening ceremony at the border post in driving rain and bitter cold .
but the bbc 's subir bhaumik , who was at the opening , says despite the poor weather conditions there was no shortage of enthusiasm among the hundreds of indian and chinese traders who had gathered there .
our lives are going to change once trade gets going sonar bhutia sikkim trader in pictures : historic opening sikkim 's old silk road " we hope the reopening of the silk route will improve relations between the two countries , " china 's ambassador to india sun yuxi told the afp news agency .
" today the border is open for traders and we hope very soon it will be open for tourists .
we are excited and feeling very good . "
the bbc 's south asia correspondent , navdip dhariwal , says the reopening of the route signifies a huge leap forward in diplomacy and trade between both countries .
local traders have welcomed the opening and say it will have a major impact on the regional economy .
" our lives are going to change once trade gets going , " a grocery supplier , sonar bhutia , is quoted as saying by the afp news agency .
" we 're hoping to profit by it . "
but correspondents say the opening is more symbolic than substantive , with trade confined to some local goods .
india will import 15 items from china , including goat and sheep skins , yak tails and raw silk .
china , for its part , will import 29 items including tea , rice and spices .
" trading will take place four days a week , monday to thursday , " says sikkim director of industries , saman prasad subba .
diplomatic triumph some analysts believe that trade through the land route could generate millions of dollars in trade eventually .
both sides have put their bitter past behind them but at the moment most agree that there are more immediate political benefits rather than economic .
" this resumption of border trade is more significant for indian diplomacy , not for trade , " says jayantanuja bandopadhyay , professor of international relations in calcutta 's jadavpur university .
sikkim is a former buddhist kingdom that merged with india in 1975 , a move that was opposed by china which lay claim to the state .
" by allowing trade through nathu la , china has accepted sikkim as part of india that it refused to do earlier , " mr bandopadhyay says .
the nathu la pass was closed in 1962 after war broke out between china and india .
the famed silk road was an ancient trading route that once connected china with india , west asia and europe .

sophos security said that the 10 most commonly found pieces of malicious software all targeted windows machines .
in contrast , it said , none of the " malware " were capable of infecting the mac os x operating system .
microsoft has pledged that the latest version of its operating system , known as vista , will be its most secure yet .
one analyst told the bbc news website that the reason why there are fewer viruses and worms on mac systems is that the smaller user base makes them a less attractive target for hackers .
microsoft windows currently runs on nearly one billion computers worldwide .
the latest version will be released later this year .
" it is our goal to give pc users the control and confidence they need so they can continue to get the most out of their pcs , " a microsoft spokesperson said .
" windows vista contains a number of new safety features that , taken together , are designed to make windows pcs more secure and online experiences safer . "
microsoft said that security on vista would be an integral part of the operating system rather than an add-on like in previous systems .
top threats the advice from sophos was given as it released a report , detailing the security threats posed to computers so far in 2006 .
the report says that there has been a vast drop in malicious software like viruses and worms . "
it seems likely that macs will continue to be the safer place for computer users for some time to come " graham cluley , sophos however , the company warns that there has been a sharp increase in the number of trojans .
it said that 82 % of new security threats this year were from these programs .
trojans are pieces of malicious software that are hidden in other legitimate programs such as downloaded screensavers .
the trojan may collect financial information or allow the infected computer to be controlled remotely for sending spam or launching web attacks .
" the continuing rise of malware will concern many - the criminals responsible are obviously making money from their code , otherwise they 'd give up the game , " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos .
mac flaws although trojans dominate the list of security threats , the most widespread problem was the sober-z worm .
the worm , which was spread by e-mail , infected people 's computers and tried to turn off security settings .
it replicated by looking for other e-mail addresses on the computers ' hard drives .
staying safe online install anti-virus software keep your anti-virus software up to date install a personal firewall use windows updates to patch security holes use reputable anti-spyware programs such as adaware or spybot do not open e-mail messages that look suspicious do not click on e-mail attachments you were not expecting at its peak , the worm accounted for one in every 13 e-mails being sent .
the worm infected computers running the windows operating system , but was not designed to infect apple macs .
" it seems likely that macs will continue to be the safer place for computer users for some time to come , " said mr cluley .
" -lsb- that is -rsb- something that home users may wish to consider if they 're deliberating about the next computer they should purchase , " he added .
but brian gammage , an analyst at gartner research does not believe the advice is well founded .
the number of people using macs is far less than those using window 's based pcs , he said .
" if you have smaller walls , you attract less graffiti , " he said .
" there is nothing architecturally safer about macs .
if everyone moved to them then the situation would change overnight " earlier this year , a security flaw in the way that macs downloaded files was identified ; while three concept viruses and a worm written specifically for apple computers were also discovered .
the viruses were never released into the " wild " and posed little security threat .

it said that 82 % of new security threats this year were from these programs .
trojans are pieces of malicious software that are hidden in other legitimate programs such as downloaded screensavers .
the trojan may collect financial information or allow the infected computer to be controlled remotely for sending spam or launching web attacks .
" the continuing rise of malware will concern many - the criminals responsible are obviously making money from their code , otherwise they 'd give up the game , " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos .

sophos security said that the 10 most commonly found pieces of malicious software all targeted windows machines .
in contrast , it said , none of the " malware " were capable of infecting the mac os x operating system .
microsoft has pledged that the latest version of its operating system , known as vista , will be its most secure yet .
one analyst told the bbc news website that the reason why there are fewer viruses and worms on mac systems is that the smaller user base makes them a less attractive target for hackers .
microsoft windows currently runs on nearly one billion computers worldwide .
the latest version will be released later this year .
" it is our goal to give pc users the control and confidence they need so they can continue to get the most out of their pcs , " a microsoft spokesperson said .
" windows vista contains a number of new safety features that , taken together , are designed to make windows pcs more secure and online experiences safer . "
microsoft said that security on vista would be an integral part of the operating system rather than an add-on like in previous systems .
top threats the advice from sophos was given as it released a report , detailing the security threats posed to computers so far in 2006 .
the report says that there has been a vast drop in malicious software like viruses and worms .
it seems likely that macs will continue to be the safer place for computer users for some time to come graham cluley , sophos however , the company warns that there has been a sharp increase in the number of trojans .
it said that 82 % of new security threats this year were from these programs .
trojans are pieces of malicious software that are hidden in other legitimate programs such as downloaded screensavers .
the trojan may collect financial information or allow the infected computer to be controlled remotely for sending spam or launching web attacks .
" the continuing rise of malware will concern many - the criminals responsible are obviously making money from their code , otherwise they 'd give up the game , " said graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos .
mac flaws although trojans dominate the list of security threats , the most widespread problem was the sober-z worm .
the worm , which was spread by e-mail , infected people 's computers and tried to turn off security settings .
it replicated by looking for other e-mail addresses on the computers ' hard drives .
staying safe online install anti-virus software keep your anti-virus software up to date install a personal firewall use windows updates to patch security holes use reputable anti-spyware programs such as adaware or spybot do not open e-mail messages that look suspicious do not click on e-mail attachments you were not expecting at its peak , the worm accounted for one in every 13 e-mails being sent .
the worm infected computers running the windows operating system , but was not designed to infect apple macs .
" it seems likely that macs will continue to be the safer place for computer users for some time to come , " said mr cluley .
" -lsb- that is -rsb- something that home users may wish to consider if they 're deliberating about the next computer they should purchase , " he added .
but brian gammage , an analyst at gartner research does not believe the advice is well founded .
the number of people using macs is far less than those using window 's based pcs , he said .
" if you have smaller walls , you attract less graffiti , " he said .
" there is nothing architecturally safer about macs .
if everyone moved to them then the situation would change overnight " earlier this year , a security flaw in the way that macs downloaded files was identified ; while three concept viruses and a worm written specifically for apple computers were also discovered .
the viruses were never released into the " wild " and posed little security threat .

breweries got a cup dividend but less so german hotels " when trinidad and tobago played -lsb- against sweden -rsb- we had a party for about 15,000 people - that 's the biggest event we 've ever done .
it was n't confined to the pub , it was the whole street , " he says .
mr byrne , manager of dortmund 's irish bar , limerick 's , waxes lyrical about the boost to business from the world cup .
" it 's been huge , really big , " he says .
" we 've had lots of brazilians , germans , swiss .
" the swiss , because beer 's so expensive in their country they seem to like to spend a lot of money .
but everyone 's spent quite a lot over here . "
while the pub industry is an obvious beneficiary of a major sports event , mr byrne says it is not the only sector to have received a boost .
" there 's been a lot of advertising in airports , all the decoration .
we 've had two large screens fitted , with projectors ; we 've had flat screen tv put in the beer garden .
huge costs with beer of course - what we 'd normally be getting in a month we 're getting in a week , or every few days . "
and with the german nation draped in the national colours , anyone selling anything in black , red and gold colours must have done very well .
but hopes that the world cup would have benefits across the entire german economy remain just that - hopes , with little evidence that it has kick-started growth .
disappointed for some , the festival has passed them by .
they have cancelled everything , they have said : ' do n't go to germany , it 's the world cup ' jorg frassa berlin hotelier heike radtke runs the olymp & hades clothing shop in dortmund .
" we have many people come in from switzerland , brazil , england - many tourists .
more people , but not really more sales , " she says .
" before the world cup began i had hoped we 'd have good business , but not really .
nothing changes . "
priti shambhu , who runs an antique leather goods store in berlin , has seen no extra trade .
" football fans like to go the bars , but they are not really interested in my things , " she laments .
" we do better when there are cultural events in berlin . "
perhaps most surprisingly , berlin hotels are suffering .
" busier ?
no , not at all , " says jorg frassa , manager of the comfort hotel auberge .
in june he normally has 80 % to 85 % occupancy , thanks to business fairs , but this june occupancy was down to 65 % .
" they have cancelled everything , they have said : ' do n't go to germany , it 's the world cup , " ' says mr frassa .
before the world cup , optimistic predictions were made that the tournament would create 50,000 jobs , that retailers would get a boost of 2bn euros , and that gdp might be boosted by up to 0.5 % .
impact unclear it is too early to know how accurate those predictions were .
dortmund television shops experienced a boom in sales but it is clear that , at this stage , the injection of cash has been limited to a few sectors , including televisions and sports merchandising .
" the real impact is uncertain , " says stephan biermeier , an analyst at deutsche bank in frankfurt .
" but the sentiment is really good and this may have benefits for consumption .
" however , the effects are limited to certain sectors .
there is some extra spending on train tickets , football shirts , and other activities related to football and the world cup .
but elsewhere , i expect just the usual spending patterns . "
even the shopkeepers in dortmund , who have seen trade in televisions and sports goods soar by 60 % or 70 % , say they believe it will be only a short-term shot in the arm .
some confusing economic figures make it difficult to know where the truth lies .
one study says consumer confidence in germany is near a five-year high .
but at the same time retail figures for may , when germans were expected to make world cup investments like expensive televisions , were down 2.2 % .
a survey by tns infratest suggests 44 % of the hospitality industry is dissatisfied with the world cup .
germany , however , had the strongest manufacturing growth across europe in june .
analysts , however , struggled to link this to " a world cup effect " , and say it seems to be a broader improvement in economic conditions .
long-term hopes germany 's economy , after years in the doldrums , badly needs something to give it a kick-start .
and while hotelier jorg frassa has seen an immediate downturn in his business , he believes the long-term effect of the world cup may be much brighter " i 'm sure it will come , " he says .
" it 's unbelievable what 's happened the last few weeks here .
all the visitors are happy , satisfied .
" all around the world people will see it , and i think we will get a lot of business , maybe starting at the end of this year and in the coming years . "
with a survey suggesting that 90 % of visitors would recommend germany as a holiday destination , his wishes may be fulfilled .

mr byrne , manager of dortmund 's irish bar , limerick 's , waxes lyrical about the boost to business from the world cup .
" it 's been huge , really big , " he says .
" we 've had lots of brazilians , germans , swiss .
" the swiss , because beer 's so expensive in their country they seem to like to spend a lot of money .
but everyone 's spent quite a lot over here . "
while the pub industry is an obvious beneficiary of a major sports event , mr byrne says it is not the only sector to have received a boost .
" there 's been a lot of advertising in airports , all the decoration .
we 've had two large screens fitted , with projectors ; we 've had flat screen tv put in the beer garden .
huge costs with beer of course - what we 'd normally be getting in a month we 're getting in a week , or every few days . "
and with the german nation draped in the national colours , anyone selling anything in black , red and gold colours must have done very well .
but hopes that the world cup would have benefits across the entire german economy remain just that - hopes , with little evidence that it has kick-started growth .
disappointed for some , the festival has passed them by .
they have cancelled everything , they have said : ' do n't go to germany , it 's the world cup ' jorg frassa berlin hotelier heike radtke runs the olymp & hades clothing shop in dortmund .
" we have many people come in from switzerland , brazil , england - many tourists .
more people , but not really more sales , " she says .
" before the world cup began i had hoped we 'd have good business , but not really .
nothing changes . "
priti shambhu , who runs an antique leather goods store in berlin , has seen no extra trade .
" football fans like to go the bars , but they are not really interested in my things , " she laments .
" we do better when there are cultural events in berlin . "
perhaps most surprisingly , berlin hotels are suffering .
" busier ?
no , not at all , " says jorg frassa , manager of the comfort hotel auberge .
in june he normally has 80 % to 85 % occupancy , thanks to business fairs , but this june occupancy was down to 65 % .
" they have cancelled everything , they have said : ' do n't go to germany , it 's the world cup , " ' says mr frassa .
before the world cup , optimistic predictions were made that the tournament would create 50,000 jobs , that retailers would get a boost of 2bn euros , and that gdp might be boosted by up to 0.5 % .
impact unclear it is too early to know how accurate those predictions were .
dortmund television shops experienced a boom in sales but it is clear that , at this stage , the injection of cash has been limited to a few sectors , including televisions and sports merchandising .
" the real impact is uncertain , " says stephan biermeier , an analyst at deutsche bank in frankfurt .
" but the sentiment is really good and this may have benefits for consumption .
" however , the effects are limited to certain sectors .
there is some extra spending on train tickets , football shirts , and other activities related to football and the world cup .
but elsewhere , i expect just the usual spending patterns . "
even the shopkeepers in dortmund , who have seen trade in televisions and sports goods soar by 60 % or 70 % , say they believe it will be only a short-term shot in the arm .
some confusing economic figures make it difficult to know where the truth lies .
one study says consumer confidence in germany is near a five-year high .
but at the same time retail figures for may , when germans were expected to make world cup investments like expensive televisions , were down 2.2 % .
a survey by tns infratest suggests 44 % of the hospitality industry is dissatisfied with the world cup .
germany , however , had the strongest manufacturing growth across europe in june .
analysts , however , struggled to link this to " a world cup effect " , and say it seems to be a broader improvement in economic conditions .
long-term hopes germany 's economy , after years in the doldrums , badly needs something to give it a kick-start .
and while hotelier jorg frassa has seen an immediate downturn in his business , he believes the long-term effect of the world cup may be much brighter " i 'm sure it will come , " he says .
" it 's unbelievable what 's happened the last few weeks here .
all the visitors are happy , satisfied .
" all around the world people will see it , and i think we will get a lot of business , maybe starting at the end of this year and in the coming years . "
with a survey suggesting that 90 % of visitors would recommend germany as a holiday destination , his wishes may be fulfilled .

breweries got a cup dividend but less so german hotels " when trinidad and tobago played -lsb- against sweden -rsb- we had a party for about 15,000 people - that 's the biggest event we 've ever done .
it was n't confined to the pub , it was the whole street , " he says .
mr byrne , manager of dortmund 's irish bar , limerick 's , waxes lyrical about the boost to business from the world cup .
" it 's been huge , really big , " he says .
" we 've had lots of brazilians , germans , swiss .
" the swiss , because beer 's so expensive in their country they seem to like to spend a lot of money .
but everyone 's spent quite a lot over here . "
while the pub industry is an obvious beneficiary of a major sports event , mr byrne says it is not the only sector to have received a boost .
" there 's been a lot of advertising in airports , all the decoration .
we 've had two large screens fitted , with projectors ; we 've had flat screen tv put in the beer garden .
huge costs with beer of course - what we 'd normally be getting in a month we 're getting in a week , or every few days . "
and with the german nation draped in the national colours , anyone selling anything in black , red and gold colours must have done very well .
but hopes that the world cup would have benefits across the entire german economy remain just that - hopes , with little evidence that it has kick-started growth .
disappointed for some , the festival has passed them by .
they have cancelled everything , they have said : ' do n't go to germany , it 's the world cup ' jorg frassa berlin hotelier heike radtke runs the olymp & hades clothing shop in dortmund .
" we have many people come in from switzerland , brazil , england - many tourists .
more people , but not really more sales , " she says .
" before the world cup began i had hoped we 'd have good business , but not really .
nothing changes . "
priti shambhu , who runs an antique leather goods store in berlin , has seen no extra trade .
" football fans like to go the bars , but they are not really interested in my things , " she laments .
" we do better when there are cultural events in berlin . "
perhaps most surprisingly , berlin hotels are suffering .
" busier ?
no , not at all , " says jorg frassa , manager of the comfort hotel auberge .
in june he normally has 80 % to 85 % occupancy , thanks to business fairs , but this june occupancy was down to 65 % .
" they have cancelled everything , they have said : ' do n't go to germany , it 's the world cup , " ' says mr frassa .
before the world cup , optimistic predictions were made that the tournament would create 50,000 jobs , that retailers would get a boost of 2bn euros , and that gdp might be boosted by up to 0.5 % .
impact unclear it is too early to know how accurate those predictions were .
dortmund television shops experienced a boom in sales but it is clear that , at this stage , the injection of cash has been limited to a few sectors , including televisions and sports merchandising .
" the real impact is uncertain , " says stephan biermeier , an analyst at deutsche bank in frankfurt .
" but the sentiment is really good and this may have benefits for consumption .
" however , the effects are limited to certain sectors .
there is some extra spending on train tickets , football shirts , and other activities related to football and the world cup .
but elsewhere , i expect just the usual spending patterns . "
even the shopkeepers in dortmund , who have seen trade in televisions and sports goods soar by 60 % or 70 % , say they believe it will be only a short-term shot in the arm .
some confusing economic figures make it difficult to know where the truth lies .
one study says consumer confidence in germany is near a five-year high .
but at the same time retail figures for may , when germans were expected to make world cup investments like expensive televisions , were down 2.2 % .
a survey by tns infratest suggests 44 % of the hospitality industry is dissatisfied with the world cup .

the commons education select committee is calling for stronger government guidelines for councils , to end a " postcode lottery " of provision .

the government said it had " done much " to improve the situation .
' confusion ' according to the committee , those with special educational needs -lrb- sen -rrb- are being " sidelined " .
it also claims the government 's " inclusion " policy - teaching pupils in mainstream schools wherever possible - is causing confusion about whether this means closing special schools .
about 1.53 million children in england are judged to have sen .
the number of special schools in the state and private sectors fell by 7 % from 1,239 in 1997 to 1,148 last year . "
without evidence it appears a policy of inclusion has developed on the basis that it benefits all children " nadine dorries mp send us your comments the committee says special schools , dealing with issues such as autism , behavioural and learning difficulties , are " invaluable " for many pupils .
it recommends more mainstream and special schools joining in federations to share ideas .
committee chairman barry sheerman said : " many of the problems identified in our report stem from the fact that sen provision has not been given sufficient priority by successive governments . "
he said standards varied widely .
" there 's a high level of satisfaction out there - about 90 % - with what parents get . "
but it was " a tough , tough world " for the minority of families who had to fight to get a formal statement detailing their child 's needs and how they should be met .
his committee 's report says local authorities have an " inbuilt conflict of interest " , in both having to assess whether a child needs special education - which is expensive - and having to provide it .
' uncomfortable ' the committee argues that mainstream schools ' need to do well in league tables means some are unwilling to accept special needs children , for fear of damaging average test results .
it says : " regardless of the theory , in practice the evidence clearly demonstrates that sen and the raising achievement agenda sit very uncomfortably together at present . "
" the needs of the child should come first and preference of the parents should be given very great weight " lord adonis responding to the report , schools minister lord adonis said " the needs of the child should come first and preference of the parents should be given very great weight " .
he said : " there should be no question in any locality of special school provision being withdrawn unless the alternative provision being made - whether it be in units , or resource provision attached to school or investment in the mainstream schools - means that those needs can be properly provided for . "
he said the government was " investing hugely " in new schools , including special schools .
the committee 's recommendation regarding " postcode lottery " of provision would be considered very seriously , lord adonis added .
tory mp nadine dorries , a member of the committee , has written her own minority report , saying her colleagues have failed to " identify in sufficient depth " the difficulties faced .
children were the " innocent victims of an ideologically-driven and dogmatic view with regard to inclusion " , she said .
' wake-up call ' shadow education secretary david willetts said : " this is a wake-up call to the government which needs to be heeded . "
" to know that your child is going into school and they may not be properly supported is really scary for any parent " sam hall parents hail mps ' report liberal democrat education spokesman stephen williams said : " the government needs to clear up the confusion it has created over what it means by ' inclusion ' .
" parents need clarity about what their child is entitled to . "
the national autistic society welcomed the committee ¿ s " hard-hitting and ambitious " report .
it particularly supported the call on the government to end " its confused message on inclusion " .
" autism is a spectrum condition that encompasses a wide range of abilities and needs and whilst some children do well in a mainstream educational setting , others will benefit from a specialist placement , " it said .
so local authorities should provide a range of mainstream and specialist provision .
another charity , scope , said 60 % of parents it had surveyed felt they had no choice of schools .

the commons education select committee is calling for stronger government guidelines for councils , to end a " postcode lottery " of provision .
it also wants ministers to clarify their policy on whether to include special needs children in mainstream schools or educate them separately .
the government said it had " done much " to improve the situation .
' confusion ' according to the committee , those with special educational needs -lrb- sen -rrb- are being " sidelined " .
it also claims the government 's " inclusion " policy - teaching pupils in mainstream schools wherever possible - is causing confusion about whether this means closing special schools .
about 1.53 million children in england are judged to have sen .
the number of special schools in the state and private sectors fell by 7 % from 1,239 in 1997 to 1,148 last year .
without evidence it appears a policy of inclusion has developed on the basis that it benefits all children nadine dorries mp send us your comments the committee says special schools , dealing with issues such as autism , behavioural and learning difficulties , are " invaluable " for many pupils .
it recommends more mainstream and special schools joining in federations to share ideas .
committee chairman barry sheerman said : " many of the problems identified in our report stem from the fact that sen provision has not been given sufficient priority by successive governments . "
he said standards varied widely .
" there 's a high level of satisfaction out there - about 90 % - with what parents get . "
but it was " a tough , tough world " for the minority of families who had to fight to get a formal statement detailing their child 's needs and how they should be met .
his committee 's report says local authorities have an " inbuilt conflict of interest " , in both having to assess whether a child needs special education - which is expensive - and having to provide it .
' uncomfortable ' the committee argues that mainstream schools ' need to do well in league tables means some are unwilling to accept special needs children , for fear of damaging average test results .
it says : " regardless of the theory , in practice the evidence clearly demonstrates that sen and the raising achievement agenda sit very uncomfortably together at present . "
the needs of the child should come first and preference of the parents should be given very great weight lord adonis responding to the report , schools minister lord adonis said " the needs of the child should come first and preference of the parents should be given very great weight " .
he said : " there should be no question in any locality of special school provision being withdrawn unless the alternative provision being made - whether it be in units , or resource provision attached to school or investment in the mainstream schools - means that those needs can be properly provided for . "
he said the government was " investing hugely " in new schools , including special schools .
the committee 's recommendation regarding " postcode lottery " of provision would be considered very seriously , lord adonis added .
tory mp nadine dorries , a member of the committee , has written her own minority report , saying her colleagues have failed to " identify in sufficient depth " the difficulties faced .
children were the " innocent victims of an ideologically-driven and dogmatic view with regard to inclusion " , she said .
' wake-up call ' shadow education secretary david willetts said : " this is a wake-up call to the government which needs to be heeded . "

the victorian society has asked english heritage to upgrade undershaw from its current grade ii status .
the " urgent application " has been made because of moves by undershaw 's current owners to redevelop the building .
a second planning application is due to be lodged next week for undershaw to be converted into separate homes .
a previous application for 13 dwellings at undershaw was rejected by waverley borough council on 8 may .
the new revised proposal is for fewer dwellings at the property , which was most recently used as a hotel .
