home economics teacher sabine kuchenbecker said a lot of people do n't know that fast food is n't only unhealthy , it 's also expensive . she said a lot of young women who never learned how to cook automatically think it 's cheaper to buy ready-to-serve meals . " but it 's significantly less expensive to cook yourself , especially if you shop a bit price-consciously , " kuchenbecker said .
" it 's our job to relay these skills to these women . " battling the bulge with healthy cooking every fifth german is too fat , according to the world health organization .
this trend is particularly prominent among underprivileged families , which tend to eat fast food or ready-to-serve meals .

the 33-year-old single mother katja does n't like mustard and turns her nose up as she takes a sniff of walnut oil to make homemade salad dressing . " well , it 's okay , but i think it 's a matter of taste , " katja said , who usually buys finished products , such as french dressing , which has lots of preservatives and is more fattening than homemade dressing . women like katja are common in neighborhoods like this .
but she wants to change her eating habits , she said . " i want to learn something about cooking and nutrition because it 's important for my daughter , " katja said .
her daughter is three years old and already slightly chubby .
katja 's unhealthy diet over the past years is evident in her figure , too . " i usually go to a snack bar or get pizza , " katja said .
but here , she has learned that homemade pizza , for example , only costs about a third of frozen pizza . cooking can spice up life instructor kuchenbecker said she wants to motivate these women to try out new things , such as using a different spice or tasting another type of salad .
participant gaby is taking the course for the second time and has learned a lot .
the 43-year-old mother of nine still has four children living at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetables are a healthy and affordable alternative to fast food " my kitchen always just had salt , pepper and paprika as spices , " gaby said .
" i did n't dare to try anything else .

" i 'm going to make my own dressing from now on . " cooking can boost self-confidence but the hamburg course is about more than just affordable meals , kuchenbecker said .
it 's also about motivation .
a lot of these women have never gotten any confirmation in their lives .
many did poorly in school , for example . " when you simply say to them , ' wow , you did that well ' or ' you did a super job seasoning that , ' they really beam at you , as they 've maybe never heard that before in their lives , " kuchenbecker said . so that the women do n't forget what they 've learned , every participant gets a goodie bag at the end of the course .

only pharmacies run by certified pharmacy owners may sell medicinal drugs , but the meds monopoly has been getting a run for its money of late . got an excruciating headache ?
need an aspirin lickety-split ?
well , if you 're in germany and it 's a sunday , forget about grabbing a bottle of over-the-counter painkillers at the grocery store . not only are german grocery stores not open sundays , you wo n't find aspirin there anyway .
unless you have friends or neighbors with aspirin on hand , you 'll just have to wrestle with the hellish mindgrip unless you 're willing to shlep around town to find the emergency pharmacy on duty . limited access , high prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head ready to explode ?
aspirin is expensive and hard to buy in germany for decades , germany 's restrictive laws have limited the selling of medications only to pharmacies , which must be personally run by registered pharmacy owners . though european countries have been deregulating everything from telecommunications to postal services and railways , german lawmakers have been reluctant to tamper with the pill market , resulting in protection against competition among pharmacies and continued high prices . as of 2004 , however , pharmacists are now allowed to own not just one , but up to three of their own stores . risky business pharmacists generally support limited access to medication , saying that it ensures public safety . " even minor painkillers contain risks and should only be sold by pharmacists who provide information on them and who sell them only in limited amounts , " said ursula sellerberg , a spokeswoman for the federation of german pharmacists ' associations -lrb- abda -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the sugar to make the medicine go down ?
still , " liberalization of who sells medication would mean greater competition and pharmacies would be forced to lower prices , " said kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . vogel said german consumer protection agencies , however , are advocating that pharmacies should still be required to provide information about medication risk . sellerberg , for her part , pointed out that stomach problems from mere aspirin can occur when taken in high doses . " we 're encouraging pharmacists to advise even for ' lighter ' medications , " she added . gaining ground chain drug stores where consumers can buy inexpensive over-the-counter medication or prescription drugs provided by a trained pharmacist have been non-existent in germany .
there 's no riteaid , no cvs , no duane read - to name some of the us 's largest retailers . that has begun to change over the past few months .
in july , former software engineer ralf däinghaus opened a docmorris - europe 's largest mail-order medication firm based in the netherlands - pharmacy in saarbrücken .
thus ensued a debate over whether germany should permit retail drug chains . on the one hand , german pharmacists say docmorris was violating german law , which forbids corporations from owning pharmacies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris store in saarbrücken in august on the other hand , saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the dutch docmorris to open shop in saarbrücken , said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law . " penny-pinchers some customers in saarbrücken were delighted , saying they could save up to 30 percent on prescription and over-the counter drugs at docmorris .
and they 're not cheap at traditional pharmacies : there a package of 20 brand-name aspirin tablets costs just under five euros -lrb- around $ 6.50 -rrb- , though a generic version of 30 tablets costs around half that . ralph däinghaus was proud to announce double the number of sales in the first month of opening the saarbrücken store , as compared to sales by the former pharmacy store he took over there . he " expected success , " he told germany 's tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- daily , because medication costs in germany are " scandalous " compared to france and belgium , where the same drugs cost half the price , taz wrote . german pharmacists were less than thrilled , however , and began worrying that their livelihoods were at stake and patients at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a " for apotheke or " pharmacy " däinghaus has also been in and out of court since july , with three saarbrücken pharmacists and two german pharmacy associations - who contested docmorris - eventually chalking up a victory when the saarland district court ordered the docmorris store in germany to be closed . " the decision was right based on german law , " said vogel , " but it is very likely that docmorris will go all the way to the european court of justice with countersuits and that the ban will be reversed and drug prices will eventually change in germany . " reform headaches in berlin , lawmakers plan to install a price cap on prescription drugs ; pharmacies could lower prices , but not raise them .
and , since only pharmacies are permitted to supply hospitals with drugs , politicians believe cheaper medication could also mean drastic savings in germany 's flailing public health care system . " but pharmacy costs make up only 2.7 percent of all the expenses of the public health care system , " said abda 's sellerberg .
" that 's only half of what the public insurance schemes need for their administrative tasks . " traditional pharmacists have been up-in-arms .
throughout november , thousands of them have staged protests across germany against health care reforms which they say threaten their existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional pharmacy in germany reform plans include a clause in which pharmacists would be expected to negotiate rebates between insurance groups and pharmaceutical manufacturers .
should they fail , pharmacists would have to contribute 500 millions euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- from their own pockets to the government . abda maintains this is unfair since costs for insurance companies have risen not because pharmacists maintain high prices , but because 80 percent of what public health insurers pay for patients ' medications goes to pharmaceutical manufacturers and taxes . kai vogel believes it 's only a matter of time until germany changes its ways and starts allowing more competition .
for now , he suggests that when shopping in pharmacies , consumers should request drug prices and ask for less expensive generic varieties . they should also make sure they do n't get a headache on sunday . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de internet pharmacies not bringing expected savings although ordering prescriptions over the internet has been made legal in germany as part of the reform measures instituted to help the burdened public health system , the expected savings have n't materialized .

they might be invading your playground any day now the bavarian city of nuremberg is planning to open an exclusive playground for senior citizens .
are the elderly - and young people alike - in germany ready for this new chapter in the war between generations ? senior citizens are a highly misunderstood group of germans .
their sole purpose in life is not - despite what many people think - to shut down their young neighbor 's parties by calling the police , to grumble about dog poop in the streets , or throw hysterical fits if their train arrives five minutes behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , the founding mother of gray panthers , is 81 senior citizens are also politically conscious and active people .
last year , a german activist group called gray panthers celebrated its 30th anniversary of fighting for senior rights .
in 1989 , the gray panthers even established a political wing - the grays - a party whose results usually appeared as an invisible condiment on the smallest slice of an election pie-chart marked " others . " but even the grays ' political invisibility seems to be becoming a thing of the past .
in the last municipal elections in berlin , the grays won the unprecedented 3.8 percent of the votes .
german seniors are coming .
with a vengeance . let 's play clever politicians know how to spot trends early .
that is why the bavarian city of nuremberg decided to jump on the bandwagon of senior renaissance and open a senior citizens ' playground , where grandmas and grandpas could get together to bowl , play chess or simply hang out with their peers .
if you 're under 60 : tough luck !
you 'll have to look for friends elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do they have to be that loud ?
" it will be a place where the senior generation can find a refuge from younger people , " said deputy mayor horst förther , who is also in charge of sport activities in the city .
" we agreed that it was a good idea , given our demographic changes . " the project in nuremberg was inspired by research from the finnish university of lapland .
the experiments with what finnish researchers called " three-generational play " showed that senior citizens experienced significant improvements in balance , co-ordination and speed after only three months of " playing . " dangers ahead " i am considering a running track , a path for roller-skating , a soft badminton court and a trampoline , which is easy on the joints , " förther said .
" all activities can be carried out slowly so that the old people are n't pushed beyond their limits . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is munch 's " scream " about modernist angst or a child off a trampoline ?
parents who ever made the fatal mistake of purchasing a trampoline for their children - losing , as a consequence , the peace of their mind and the quiet of their garden - would beg to differ .
a trampoline may be easy on the joints , but it is known to produce an adrenaline rush in children on pair with bungee jumping off the chinese yangtze river tamer known as the three gorges dam .
it turns children into wild , uncontrollable , self-sustainable noise-machines .
it may have the same effect on senior citizens . " retired people need a space to be themselves without someone coming along and spilling ice-cream on their trousers or breakdancing , " said social worker andrea weber , who specializes in the lifestyle of the elderly . a cultural shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more playground sharing !
aside from the question whether ice-cream eating breakdancers have nothing better to do than throw scoops of chocolate-vanilla gelato at the local senior population , the german war of generations may take a turn for the bizarre . if , in early afternoon hours , playgrounds start filling with bouncing and screaming grandpas , those very same young people who had their party shut down the night before by their intolerant neighbors , may have to resort to calling the police to whine about the jumping geriatrics of germany ruining their alternative , hung-over , 4-pm breakfast . things could get really interesting . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

" well , it 's okay , but i think it 's a matter of taste , " katja said , who usually buys finished products , such as french dressing , which has lots of preservatives and is more fattening than homemade dressing . women like katja are common in neighborhoods like this .
but she wants to change her eating habits , she said . " i want to learn something about cooking and nutrition because it 's important for my daughter , " katja said .
her daughter is three years old and already slightly chubby .
katja 's unhealthy diet over the past years is evident in her figure , too . " i usually go to a snack bar or get pizza , " katja said .

" many governments cooperated passively or actively -lrb- with the cia -rrb- , " the committee 's rapporteur claudio fava said .
" they knew .

the eu committee also claimed austria , great britain , italy , poland , sweden , ireland , spain , portugal , greece and cyprus knew about the prisons . the report urged officials in the individual eu countries to start their own investigations as to whether their governments have broken european human rights accords with their use of extraordinary rendition . it also criticizes eu foreign policy chief javier solana and anti-terror coordinator gijs de vries , accusing them of having given incomplete statements to the investigating committee . failure to cooperate the report was especially critical of solana , expressing its " profound preoccupation " with the " omissions " and " denials " when the eu 's top diplomat appeared before the committee , in may . germany and spain were the only countries fava said adequately cooperated with eu committee 's investigation .

the deutsche bank chief had agreed to pay the money - which amounts to three months ' of his current wages - out of his own pocket . charges were also dropped against the other five co-defendants , likewise in return for cash payments .

they were accused of breaking the law by approving 111.5 million marks -lrb- 57 million euros -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives .

it also raised ethical questions about what had been the successful transformation of mannesmann from an industrial conglomerate into a leading mobile telecommunications group . in the original trial , the court ruled that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . at the time of the mannesmann payouts , ackermann had been a member of the group 's supervisory board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense said the bonuses were a valid way to motivate company brass ackermann and his defense team argued that big payouts to executives , common in the united states and britain , were needed to motivate corporate leaders to take risks . after all , mannesmann had been transformed from a heavy engineering group into a telecommunications giant at the beginning of deregulation of telecommunications and the arrival of mobile telephones . esser argued during his trial that the price of shares in the company had doubled during his tenure . prosecutors contended that the payments were illegal because they were designed to persuade managers , and esser in particular , to drop their resistance to vodafone 's bid after a long takeover battle .

the deutsche bank chief had agreed to pay the money - which amounts to three months ' of his current wages - out of his own pocket . charges were also dropped against the other five co-defendants , likewise in return for cash payments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 29.11.2006 pill power : pharmacies battle over who sells meds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting the right advice about meds is essential , say pharmacists buying prescription and over-the-counter drugs is no easy task in germany .
only pharmacies run by certified pharmacy owners may sell medicinal drugs , but the meds monopoly has been getting a run for its money of late . got an excruciating headache ?
need an aspirin lickety-split ?
well , if you 're in germany and it 's a sunday , forget about grabbing a bottle of over-the-counter painkillers at the grocery store . not only are german grocery stores not open sundays , you wo n't find aspirin there anyway .
unless you have friends or neighbors with aspirin on hand , you 'll just have to wrestle with the hellish mindgrip unless you 're willing to shlep around town to find the emergency pharmacy on duty . limited access , high prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head ready to explode ?
aspirin is expensive and hard to buy in germany for decades , germany 's restrictive laws have limited the selling of medications only to pharmacies , which must be personally run by registered pharmacy owners . though european countries have been deregulating everything from telecommunications to postal services and railways , german lawmakers have been reluctant to tamper with the pill market , resulting in protection against competition among pharmacies and continued high prices . as of 2004 , however , pharmacists are now allowed to own not just one , but up to three of their own stores . risky business pharmacists generally support limited access to medication , saying that it ensures public safety . " even minor painkillers contain risks and should only be sold by pharmacists who provide information on them and who sell them only in limited amounts , " said ursula sellerberg , a spokeswoman for the federation of german pharmacists ' associations -lrb- abda -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the sugar to make the medicine go down ?
still , " liberalization of who sells medication would mean greater competition and pharmacies would be forced to lower prices , " said kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . vogel said german consumer protection agencies , however , are advocating that pharmacies should still be required to provide information about medication risk . sellerberg , for her part , pointed out that stomach problems from mere aspirin can occur when taken in high doses . " we 're encouraging pharmacists to advise even for ' lighter ' medications , " she added . gaining ground chain drug stores where consumers can buy inexpensive over-the-counter medication or prescription drugs provided by a trained pharmacist have been non-existent in germany .

only pharmacies run by certified pharmacy owners may sell medicinal drugs , but the meds monopoly has been getting a run for its money of late . got an excruciating headache ?
need an aspirin lickety-split ?
well , if you 're in germany and it 's a sunday , forget about grabbing a bottle of over-the-counter painkillers at the grocery store . not only are german grocery stores not open sundays , you wo n't find aspirin there anyway .
unless you have friends or neighbors with aspirin on hand , you 'll just have to wrestle with the hellish mindgrip unless you 're willing to shlep around town to find the emergency pharmacy on duty . limited access , high prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head ready to explode ?
aspirin is expensive and hard to buy in germany for decades , germany 's restrictive laws have limited the selling of medications only to pharmacies , which must be personally run by registered pharmacy owners . though european countries have been deregulating everything from telecommunications to postal services and railways , german lawmakers have been reluctant to tamper with the pill market , resulting in protection against competition among pharmacies and continued high prices . as of 2004 , however , pharmacists are now allowed to own not just one , but up to three of their own stores . risky business pharmacists generally support limited access to medication , saying that it ensures public safety . " even minor painkillers contain risks and should only be sold by pharmacists who provide information on them and who sell them only in limited amounts , " said ursula sellerberg , a spokeswoman for the federation of german pharmacists ' associations -lrb- abda -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the sugar to make the medicine go down ?
still , " liberalization of who sells medication would mean greater competition and pharmacies would be forced to lower prices , " said kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . vogel said german consumer protection agencies , however , are advocating that pharmacies should still be required to provide information about medication risk . sellerberg , for her part , pointed out that stomach problems from mere aspirin can occur when taken in high doses . " we 're encouraging pharmacists to advise even for ' lighter ' medications , " she added . gaining ground chain drug stores where consumers can buy inexpensive over-the-counter medication or prescription drugs provided by a trained pharmacist have been non-existent in germany .
there 's no riteaid , no cvs , no duane read - to name some of the us 's largest retailers . that has begun to change over the past few months .
in july , former software engineer ralf däinghaus opened a docmorris - europe 's largest mail-order medication firm based in the netherlands - pharmacy in saarbrücken .
thus ensued a debate over whether germany should permit retail drug chains . on the one hand , german pharmacists say docmorris was violating german law , which forbids corporations from owning pharmacies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris store in saarbrücken in august on the other hand , saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the dutch docmorris to open shop in saarbrücken , said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law . " penny-pinchers some customers in saarbrücken were delighted , saying they could save up to 30 percent on prescription and over-the counter drugs at docmorris .
and they 're not cheap at traditional pharmacies : there a package of 20 brand-name aspirin tablets costs just under five euros -lrb- around $ 6.50 -rrb- , though a generic version of 30 tablets costs around half that . ralph däinghaus was proud to announce double the number of sales in the first month of opening the saarbrücken store , as compared to sales by the former pharmacy store he took over there . he " expected success , " he told germany 's tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- daily , because medication costs in germany are " scandalous " compared to france and belgium , where the same drugs cost half the price , taz wrote . german pharmacists were less than thrilled , however , and began worrying that their livelihoods were at stake and patients at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a " for apotheke or " pharmacy " däinghaus has also been in and out of court since july , with three saarbrücken pharmacists and two german pharmacy associations - who contested docmorris - eventually chalking up a victory when the saarland district court ordered the docmorris store in germany to be closed . " the decision was right based on german law , " said vogel , " but it is very likely that docmorris will go all the way to the european court of justice with countersuits and that the ban will be reversed and drug prices will eventually change in germany . " reform headaches in berlin , lawmakers plan to install a price cap on prescription drugs ; pharmacies could lower prices , but not raise them .
and , since only pharmacies are permitted to supply hospitals with drugs , politicians believe cheaper medication could also mean drastic savings in germany 's flailing public health care system . " but pharmacy costs make up only 2.7 percent of all the expenses of the public health care system , " said abda 's sellerberg .
" that 's only half of what the public insurance schemes need for their administrative tasks . " traditional pharmacists have been up-in-arms .
throughout november , thousands of them have staged protests across germany against health care reforms which they say threaten their existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional pharmacy in germany reform plans include a clause in which pharmacists would be expected to negotiate rebates between insurance groups and pharmaceutical manufacturers .
should they fail , pharmacists would have to contribute 500 millions euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- from their own pockets to the government . abda maintains this is unfair since costs for insurance companies have risen not because pharmacists maintain high prices , but because 80 percent of what public health insurers pay for patients ' medications goes to pharmaceutical manufacturers and taxes . kai vogel believes it 's only a matter of time until germany changes its ways and starts allowing more competition .
for now , he suggests that when shopping in pharmacies , consumers should request drug prices and ask for less expensive generic varieties . they should also make sure they do n't get a headache on sunday . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de internet pharmacies not bringing expected savings although ordering prescriptions over the internet has been made legal in germany as part of the reform measures instituted to help the burdened public health system , the expected savings have n't materialized .

the scheme , established last year and ending in 2007 , aims to reduce carbon emissions by providing a market-based trading system .
it is based on limiting the total amount of co2 emissions , but can offer control over reductions flexibly and at a low-cost . it is designed to put caps on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by heavily polluting factories across europe .
but in 2006 , the governments of some eu countries gave away free carbon pollution permits that exceeded the amount of pollution that was released - which the european environment commission has decided to put a stop to . germany was the most generous , with france and poland also handing out carbon credits faster than pollution can be emitted .
only a few countries - such as britain and ireland - distributed allowances that fairly matched the needs of big companies . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas criticized several european countries , including germany , greece , ireland , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia and sweden , for giving away too many pollution allowances that they hold in reserve for building new factories . " today 's decision sends a strong signal that europe is fully committed to achieving the kyoto target and making the eu ets a success , " dimas said in a statement . drastic reductions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the carbon trading scheme is working towards meeting kyoto targets stephan singer , the head of the european climate and energy policy unit in brussels for the wwf , was pleased that the allowances for germany to pollute have been reduced " quite drastically . " " germany has proposed that once it gets an allocation for a coal fire station , the allocation would be valid for the next 14 years at least - which the commission objected to , " singer said .
" this is particularly good , considering that germany is the largest oecd country in the european union . " singer said the wwf would like to see the commission " keep persistent and as straight forward , to help europe to deliver on its kyoto targets . " germany under fire over carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coal industry will probably be affected by the commissions ruling germany was the most generous with the emission credit surpluses , producing 21.4 million tons , or 4.3 percent less in emissions than its average annual cap allowance , according to a report in the new york times . france , germany , italy , poland , spain and uk make up for 73 percent of overall eu emissions .
singer said that the permits to pollute , based on an earlier draft by the german government , were " quite horrible . " for a country that wants to lead the world in climate change and renewable energy , its allowances to grow its coal base in the power sector are a scandalous proposal to the commission , " he said . the german coal industry has come out against the commissions stance , arguing that it will hurt the utilities sector . singer responded by saying that if the coal industry is complaining about the decision , then " i know that dimas has done the right thing . " the wwf wants to see the commission review allowing countries or coal-fired power stations to buy emissions , like through auctioning .

the scheme , established last year and ending in 2007 , aims to reduce carbon emissions by providing a market-based trading system .
it is based on limiting the total amount of co2 emissions , but can offer control over reductions flexibly and at a low-cost . it is designed to put caps on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by heavily polluting factories across europe .
but in 2006 , the governments of some eu countries gave away free carbon pollution permits that exceeded the amount of pollution that was released - which the european environment commission has decided to put a stop to . germany was the most generous , with france and poland also handing out carbon credits faster than pollution can be emitted .

the plant which employs 900 people would then be dismantled and rebuilt elsewhere by 2015 . the final details will be worked out over the next months but fraport has already agreed to recompense celanese with a sum of 650 million euros -lrb- $ 855 million -rrb- .

while air traffic in europe continues to expand massively , frankfurt airport is already operating at the limit of its capacity .
fraport argues that an extra runway could boost capacity by half and the company is also planning to build a third terminal .

a spokesman for celanese declined to comment but insisted the plant would remain in germany . the hesse region 's opposition spd and green parties were critical of the deal , saying that thousands of jobs would be axed as part of the relocation . under the terms of the deal , fraport has agreed to set up an employment company for ticona employees who can not be transferred .
the hesse authorities will also be involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stock exchange in frankfurt " the fact that an employment company is being set up is a clear sign of what 's to come , " said the greens ' chief whip frank kaufmann .

" and every day that global air traffic flies past us is a lost day for our company and our employees , as well as for the region and the people who live here . " although investors are in favor of the expansion plans , they appeared concerned by the costs .

european heavyweight states like germany , france , spain and italy came under pressure to do more in southern afghanistan , where british-led troops have faced a growing death toll in fighting against taliban insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the chances for success in afghanistan had risen thanks to the summit chancellor angela merkel after the summit stressed that germany 's contribution to the afghanistan mission was highly valued by its nato partners .
she had also once more assured alliance members that germany would come to nato 's aid in emergencies beyond the locations where the bundeswehr is deployed . she added that solidarity demanded it and that it was clear " germany would n't close its eyes to this solidarity . " as an example , she suggested evacuating wounded soldiers from other nato states .
question of credibility nato took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in 2003 .

" i have been tasked ... to think about and to forward proposals on the possibility of a contact group for afghanistan , " de hoop scheffer added . overall , he said the nato summit was good news for the people of afghanistan , " the bottom line is that , five years after the fall of the taliban , afghanistan is making progress . "
" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 29.11.2006 nato decides to bolster troubled afghan force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan remains at the top of nato 's priority list nato clinched an agreement wednesday to bolster its troubled mission in afghanistan by sending more troops and cutting restrictions on forces already there , while admitting that gaps remain . leaders of the 26-nation bloc , including us president george w. bush , also backed a french proposal to set up a " contact group " to coordinate action to prevent afghanistan slipping back toward chaos . closer to its traditional home ground , the leaders also agreed to admit serbia , montenegro and bosnia-herzegovina to its partnership for peace program , a decade after the wars that ripped the balkans apart . the pledge on afghanistan , announced at the end of a two-day summit in riga , came after the united states and britain in particular lobbied for more troops and fewer caveats on the forces in the violence-wracked country .
european heavyweight states like germany , france , spain and italy came under pressure to do more in southern afghanistan , where british-led troops have faced a growing death toll in fighting against taliban insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the chances for success in afghanistan had risen thanks to the summit chancellor angela merkel after the summit stressed that germany 's contribution to the afghanistan mission was highly valued by its nato partners .
she had also once more assured alliance members that germany would come to nato 's aid in emergencies beyond the locations where the bundeswehr is deployed . she added that solidarity demanded it and that it was clear " germany would n't close its eyes to this solidarity . " as an example , she suggested evacuating wounded soldiers from other nato states .
question of credibility nato took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in 2003 .
it currently comprises some 32,000 troops from 37 nations .
isaf has , however , faced increasingly fierce fighting since moving into the volatile south this year , and in september nato 's top commander us general james jones called for 2,500 extra military personnel . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the agreement on afghanistan . " everyone accepts this is nato 's absolutely critical mission , " he said .
" there is complete agreement around the table that nato 's credibility is ... on the line . " but he also admitted that shortfalls remained , with military chiefs saying that so far 85-90 percent of requirements were in place . " we have made significant progress but we still need to make those last remaining steps , " blair said . rapid reaction force nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer highlighted an agreement to deploy forces to help out in emergencies .
" in an emergency ... they will support each other , " he said .
" that is the most fundamental demonstration of nato 's solidarity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer the nato secretary general also confirmed that alliance leaders had supported french president jacques chirac 's proposal to establish an afghan " contact group . "
this could be along the lines of such a group set up for the balkans in the 1990s , comprising the united states , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , to coordinate diplomatic and other action to resolve the conflict . " i have been tasked ... to think about and to forward proposals on the possibility of a contact group for afghanistan , " de hoop scheffer added . overall , he said the nato summit was good news for the people of afghanistan , " the bottom line is that , five years after the fall of the taliban , afghanistan is making progress . "
" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself . " taking into account the importance of long-term stability in the western balkans and acknowledging the progress made so far ... we have invited these three countries to join partnership for peace , " said the nato declaration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was high for the summit and riga 's old town was almost deserted chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte criticized the invitation to the three states , her spokesman said after the summit . " the prosecutor regrets this decision because it looks like a reward for the lack of cooperation ... with the office of the prosecutor , " the spokesman , anton nikiforov , told reporters . nato leaders also decided to invite new countries to join the alliance without naming any country best placed to become a member . " at our next summit in 2008 , the alliance intends to extend further invitations to those countries who meet nato 's performance-based standards and are able to contribute to euro-atlantic security and stability , " they said . also in riga , the nato chiefs declared " fully operational " the alliance 's flagship 25,000-strong nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- .

" we are going to recommend suspending the chapters of negotiations which are connected with commercial restrictions on cyprus , which is between four and nine chapters out of 35 , " a commission source said . " turkey has undoubtedly made progress .
but it has still not implemented all obligations it has agreed to , " said commission president jose manuel barroso . a spokesman for the turkish representation to the eu in brussels , caglar cakiralp , said eight " chapters , " or policy areas into which the accession talks are divided , would be suspended . he added that he considered the move too harsh . " it means you suspend nearly the whole process , " he said .
" it 's too much . " commission " sending a signal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ankara alone recognizes the turkish republic of northern cyprus the recommendation came after talks brokered by the eu 's finnish presidency on the cyprus trade issue failed on monday . " the commission wants to send a signal that turkey must meet its obligations , " a senior eu official told reuters news service . the commission 's move won immediate backing from german chancellor angela merkel . " i view it as right , " she told reporters .
" it is a strong signal when one says there are chapters which can not be opened . " merkel , speaking at a nato summit in riga , said it was essential that turkey implement its pledge not to discriminate against eu states . the german leader opposes turkish eu membership and instead calls for ankara to be given what she terms a " privileged partnership . " the german line is echoed by austria , france and the netherlands . the likely halting of eu-turkey negotiations means that germany , which takes over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2007 , could be handed an unwelcome political hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's tony blair warned the eu on taking too hard a line the eu is , however , deeply divided when it comes to accepting turkey into it ranks . british prime minister tony blair , speaking after meeting turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan at a nato summit in riga , said the bloc should not send a negative signal to turkey . " we have got to make sure we allow turkey 's accession to proceed , " blair said .
" just at the moment to send an adverse signal to turkey i think would be a serious mistake for europe long-term . " long-term threats eu foreign ministers are due to decide on the matter , based on the commission 's recommendations , when they meet on dec .
11 . the policy sectors to be frozen involve the free movement of goods , capital and services , as well as customs , trade , transport , agriculture and fisheries , the sources said .
the commission would recommend that negotiations proceed on the other chapters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement chief olli rehn said turkey could still avoid the suspension of talks so far , turkey has provisionally concluded talks on one chapter - science and research . for months the eu has been threatening full or partial suspension of membership talks with turkey over its refusal to open its ports to cyprus . stuck in a stalemate ankara refuses to do that until the 25-nation bloc keeps its 2004 promise to ease economic sanctions imposed on the island 's breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , recognized only by ankara . finland , which is a supporter of turkey 's eu membership , has been trying to resolve the stalemate since september with a proposal that included turkey opening its ports and the eu trading directly with the self-proclaimed trnc . but helsinki threw in the towel on monday , saying there was no hope of an agreement during its eu presidency , which concludes on dec .

" we are going to recommend suspending the chapters of negotiations which are connected with commercial restrictions on cyprus , which is between four and nine chapters out of 35 , " a commission source said . " turkey has undoubtedly made progress .
but it has still not implemented all obligations it has agreed to , " said commission president jose manuel barroso . a spokesman for the turkish representation to the eu in brussels , caglar cakiralp , said eight " chapters , " or policy areas into which the accession talks are divided , would be suspended . he added that he considered the move too harsh . " it means you suspend nearly the whole process , " he said .
" it 's too much . " commission " sending a signal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ankara alone recognizes the turkish republic of northern cyprus the recommendation came after talks brokered by the eu 's finnish presidency on the cyprus trade issue failed on monday . " the commission wants to send a signal that turkey must meet its obligations , " a senior eu official told reuters news service . the commission 's move won immediate backing from german chancellor angela merkel . " i view it as right , " she told reporters .
" it is a strong signal when one says there are chapters which can not be opened . " merkel , speaking at a nato summit in riga , said it was essential that turkey implement its pledge not to discriminate against eu states . the german leader opposes turkish eu membership and instead calls for ankara to be given what she terms a " privileged partnership . " the german line is echoed by austria , france and the netherlands . the likely halting of eu-turkey negotiations means that germany , which takes over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2007 , could be handed an unwelcome political hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's tony blair warned the eu on taking too hard a line the eu is , however , deeply divided when it comes to accepting turkey into it ranks . british prime minister tony blair , speaking after meeting turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan at a nato summit in riga , said the bloc should not send a negative signal to turkey . " we have got to make sure we allow turkey 's accession to proceed , " blair said .
" just at the moment to send an adverse signal to turkey i think would be a serious mistake for europe long-term . " long-term threats eu foreign ministers are due to decide on the matter , based on the commission 's recommendations , when they meet on dec .
11 . the policy sectors to be frozen involve the free movement of goods , capital and services , as well as customs , trade , transport , agriculture and fisheries , the sources said .
the commission would recommend that negotiations proceed on the other chapters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement chief olli rehn said turkey could still avoid the suspension of talks so far , turkey has provisionally concluded talks on one chapter - science and research . for months the eu has been threatening full or partial suspension of membership talks with turkey over its refusal to open its ports to cyprus . stuck in a stalemate ankara refuses to do that until the 25-nation bloc keeps its 2004 promise to ease economic sanctions imposed on the island 's breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , recognized only by ankara . finland , which is a supporter of turkey 's eu membership , has been trying to resolve the stalemate since september with a proposal that included turkey opening its ports and the eu trading directly with the self-proclaimed trnc . but helsinki threw in the towel on monday , saying there was no hope of an agreement during its eu presidency , which concludes on dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 29.11.2006 cooking course takes a bite out of obesity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : curried sausage is a fast food staple in germany western populations are getting fatter , due to too little exercise and too much fast food .
socially disadvantaged families are particularly prone to such diets .
but a cooking course in hamburg hopes to change that . a cooking project in the hamburg neighborhood jensfeld , home to a large number of socially underprivileged families , is helping women rethink their families ' diets and start preparing more home-cooked meals . once a week for three hours , the participants learn how to whip up delicious healthy meals with little effort and a small budget .
home economics teacher sabine kuchenbecker said a lot of people do n't know that fast food is n't only unhealthy , it 's also expensive . she said a lot of young women who never learned how to cook automatically think it 's cheaper to buy ready-to-serve meals . " but it 's significantly less expensive to cook yourself , especially if you shop a bit price-consciously , " kuchenbecker said .
" it 's our job to relay these skills to these women . " battling the bulge with healthy cooking every fifth german is too fat , according to the world health organization .
this trend is particularly prominent among underprivileged families , which tend to eat fast food or ready-to-serve meals .
the results are serious health problems , such as diabetes at a young age , stiffening of the joints or even cardiovascular diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast food can lead to serious health problems for children the charity hamburger tafel or hamburg table is coordinating the project , which costs five euros -lrb- $ 6.60 -rrb- for the five-week course . for the participants , healthy is n't always easy to get used to , though .
the 33-year-old single mother katja does n't like mustard and turns her nose up as she takes a sniff of walnut oil to make homemade salad dressing . " well , it 's okay , but i think it 's a matter of taste , " katja said , who usually buys finished products , such as french dressing , which has lots of preservatives and is more fattening than homemade dressing . women like katja are common in neighborhoods like this .
but she wants to change her eating habits , she said . " i want to learn something about cooking and nutrition because it 's important for my daughter , " katja said .
her daughter is three years old and already slightly chubby .
katja 's unhealthy diet over the past years is evident in her figure , too . " i usually go to a snack bar or get pizza , " katja said .
but here , she has learned that homemade pizza , for example , only costs about a third of frozen pizza . cooking can spice up life instructor kuchenbecker said she wants to motivate these women to try out new things , such as using a different spice or tasting another type of salad .
participant gaby is taking the course for the second time and has learned a lot .
the 43-year-old mother of nine still has four children living at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetables are a healthy and affordable alternative to fast food " my kitchen always just had salt , pepper and paprika as spices , " gaby said .
" i did n't dare to try anything else .
now , when i make a soup , i put in oregano and thyme and it really tastes better to me . " even katja has tried her first homemade dressing with mustard and walnut oil , and it 's was n't bad , she said . " it tastes good now that i 've tried it , " katja said .
" i 'm going to make my own dressing from now on . " cooking can boost self-confidence but the hamburg course is about more than just affordable meals , kuchenbecker said .
it 's also about motivation .
a lot of these women have never gotten any confirmation in their lives .
many did poorly in school , for example . " when you simply say to them , ' wow , you did that well ' or ' you did a super job seasoning that , ' they really beam at you , as they 've maybe never heard that before in their lives , " kuchenbecker said . so that the women do n't forget what they 've learned , every participant gets a goodie bag at the end of the course .

her daughter is three years old and already slightly chubby .

only pharmacies run by certified pharmacy owners may sell medicinal drugs , but the meds monopoly has been getting a run for its money of late . got an excruciating headache ?
need an aspirin lickety-split ?
well , if you 're in germany and it 's a sunday , forget about grabbing a bottle of over-the-counter painkillers at the grocery store . not only are german grocery stores not open sundays , you wo n't find aspirin there anyway .
unless you have friends or neighbors with aspirin on hand , you 'll just have to wrestle with the hellish mindgrip unless you 're willing to shlep around town to find the emergency pharmacy on duty . limited access , high prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head ready to explode ?
aspirin is expensive and hard to buy in germany for decades , germany 's restrictive laws have limited the selling of medications only to pharmacies , which must be personally run by registered pharmacy owners . though european countries have been deregulating everything from telecommunications to postal services and railways , german lawmakers have been reluctant to tamper with the pill market , resulting in protection against competition among pharmacies and continued high prices . as of 2004 , however , pharmacists are now allowed to own not just one , but up to three of their own stores . risky business pharmacists generally support limited access to medication , saying that it ensures public safety . " even minor painkillers contain risks and should only be sold by pharmacists who provide information on them and who sell them only in limited amounts , " said ursula sellerberg , a spokeswoman for the federation of german pharmacists ' associations -lrb- abda -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the sugar to make the medicine go down ?
still , " liberalization of who sells medication would mean greater competition and pharmacies would be forced to lower prices , " said kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . vogel said german consumer protection agencies , however , are advocating that pharmacies should still be required to provide information about medication risk . sellerberg , for her part , pointed out that stomach problems from mere aspirin can occur when taken in high doses . " we 're encouraging pharmacists to advise even for ' lighter ' medications , " she added . gaining ground chain drug stores where consumers can buy inexpensive over-the-counter medication or prescription drugs provided by a trained pharmacist have been non-existent in germany .
there 's no riteaid , no cvs , no duane read - to name some of the us 's largest retailers . that has begun to change over the past few months .
in july , former software engineer ralf däinghaus opened a docmorris - europe 's largest mail-order medication firm based in the netherlands - pharmacy in saarbrücken .
thus ensued a debate over whether germany should permit retail drug chains . on the one hand , german pharmacists say docmorris was violating german law , which forbids corporations from owning pharmacies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris store in saarbrücken in august on the other hand , saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the dutch docmorris to open shop in saarbrücken , said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law . " penny-pinchers some customers in saarbrücken were delighted , saying they could save up to 30 percent on prescription and over-the counter drugs at docmorris .
and they 're not cheap at traditional pharmacies : there a package of 20 brand-name aspirin tablets costs just under five euros -lrb- around $ 6.50 -rrb- , though a generic version of 30 tablets costs around half that . ralph däinghaus was proud to announce double the number of sales in the first month of opening the saarbrücken store , as compared to sales by the former pharmacy store he took over there . he " expected success , " he told germany 's tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- daily , because medication costs in germany are " scandalous " compared to france and belgium , where the same drugs cost half the price , taz wrote . german pharmacists were less than thrilled , however , and began worrying that their livelihoods were at stake and patients at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a " for apotheke or " pharmacy " däinghaus has also been in and out of court since july , with three saarbrücken pharmacists and two german pharmacy associations - who contested docmorris - eventually chalking up a victory when the saarland district court ordered the docmorris store in germany to be closed . " the decision was right based on german law , " said vogel , " but it is very likely that docmorris will go all the way to the european court of justice with countersuits and that the ban will be reversed and drug prices will eventually change in germany . " reform headaches in berlin , lawmakers plan to install a price cap on prescription drugs ; pharmacies could lower prices , but not raise them .
and , since only pharmacies are permitted to supply hospitals with drugs , politicians believe cheaper medication could also mean drastic savings in germany 's flailing public health care system . " but pharmacy costs make up only 2.7 percent of all the expenses of the public health care system , " said abda 's sellerberg .
" that 's only half of what the public insurance schemes need for their administrative tasks . " traditional pharmacists have been up-in-arms .
throughout november , thousands of them have staged protests across germany against health care reforms which they say threaten their existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional pharmacy in germany reform plans include a clause in which pharmacists would be expected to negotiate rebates between insurance groups and pharmaceutical manufacturers .
should they fail , pharmacists would have to contribute 500 millions euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- from their own pockets to the government . abda maintains this is unfair since costs for insurance companies have risen not because pharmacists maintain high prices , but because 80 percent of what public health insurers pay for patients ' medications goes to pharmaceutical manufacturers and taxes . kai vogel believes it 's only a matter of time until germany changes its ways and starts allowing more competition .
for now , he suggests that when shopping in pharmacies , consumers should request drug prices and ask for less expensive generic varieties . they should also make sure they do n't get a headache on sunday . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de internet pharmacies not bringing expected savings although ordering prescriptions over the internet has been made legal in germany as part of the reform measures instituted to help the burdened public health system , the expected savings have n't materialized .

only pharmacies run by certified pharmacy owners may sell medicinal drugs , but the meds monopoly has been getting a run for its money of late . got an excruciating headache ?
need an aspirin lickety-split ?
well , if you 're in germany and it 's a sunday , forget about grabbing a bottle of over-the-counter painkillers at the grocery store . not only are german grocery stores not open sundays , you wo n't find aspirin there anyway .
unless you have friends or neighbors with aspirin on hand , you 'll just have to wrestle with the hellish mindgrip unless you 're willing to shlep around town to find the emergency pharmacy on duty . limited access , high prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head ready to explode ?
aspirin is expensive and hard to buy in germany for decades , germany 's restrictive laws have limited the selling of medications only to pharmacies , which must be personally run by registered pharmacy owners . though european countries have been deregulating everything from telecommunications to postal services and railways , german lawmakers have been reluctant to tamper with the pill market , resulting in protection against competition among pharmacies and continued high prices . as of 2004 , however , pharmacists are now allowed to own not just one , but up to three of their own stores . risky business pharmacists generally support limited access to medication , saying that it ensures public safety . " even minor painkillers contain risks and should only be sold by pharmacists who provide information on them and who sell them only in limited amounts , " said ursula sellerberg , a spokeswoman for the federation of german pharmacists ' associations -lrb- abda -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the sugar to make the medicine go down ?
still , " liberalization of who sells medication would mean greater competition and pharmacies would be forced to lower prices , " said kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . vogel said german consumer protection agencies , however , are advocating that pharmacies should still be required to provide information about medication risk . sellerberg , for her part , pointed out that stomach problems from mere aspirin can occur when taken in high doses . " we 're encouraging pharmacists to advise even for ' lighter ' medications , " she added . gaining ground chain drug stores where consumers can buy inexpensive over-the-counter medication or prescription drugs provided by a trained pharmacist have been non-existent in germany .
there 's no riteaid , no cvs , no duane read - to name some of the us 's largest retailers . that has begun to change over the past few months .
in july , former software engineer ralf däinghaus opened a docmorris - europe 's largest mail-order medication firm based in the netherlands - pharmacy in saarbrücken .
thus ensued a debate over whether germany should permit retail drug chains . on the one hand , german pharmacists say docmorris was violating german law , which forbids corporations from owning pharmacies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris store in saarbrücken in august on the other hand , saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the dutch docmorris to open shop in saarbrücken , said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law . " penny-pinchers some customers in saarbrücken were delighted , saying they could save up to 30 percent on prescription and over-the counter drugs at docmorris .
and they 're not cheap at traditional pharmacies : there a package of 20 brand-name aspirin tablets costs just under five euros -lrb- around $ 6.50 -rrb- , though a generic version of 30 tablets costs around half that . ralph däinghaus was proud to announce double the number of sales in the first month of opening the saarbrücken store , as compared to sales by the former pharmacy store he took over there . he " expected success , " he told germany 's tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- daily , because medication costs in germany are " scandalous " compared to france and belgium , where the same drugs cost half the price , taz wrote . german pharmacists were less than thrilled , however , and began worrying that their livelihoods were at stake and patients at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a " for apotheke or " pharmacy " däinghaus has also been in and out of court since july , with three saarbrücken pharmacists and two german pharmacy associations - who contested docmorris - eventually chalking up a victory when the saarland district court ordered the docmorris store in germany to be closed . " the decision was right based on german law , " said vogel , " but it is very likely that docmorris will go all the way to the european court of justice with countersuits and that the ban will be reversed and drug prices will eventually change in germany . " reform headaches in berlin , lawmakers plan to install a price cap on prescription drugs ; pharmacies could lower prices , but not raise them .
and , since only pharmacies are permitted to supply hospitals with drugs , politicians believe cheaper medication could also mean drastic savings in germany 's flailing public health care system . " but pharmacy costs make up only 2.7 percent of all the expenses of the public health care system , " said abda 's sellerberg .
" that 's only half of what the public insurance schemes need for their administrative tasks . " traditional pharmacists have been up-in-arms .
throughout november , thousands of them have staged protests across germany against health care reforms which they say threaten their existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional pharmacy in germany reform plans include a clause in which pharmacists would be expected to negotiate rebates between insurance groups and pharmaceutical manufacturers .

the scheme , established last year and ending in 2007 , aims to reduce carbon emissions by providing a market-based trading system .
it is based on limiting the total amount of co2 emissions , but can offer control over reductions flexibly and at a low-cost . it is designed to put caps on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by heavily polluting factories across europe .
but in 2006 , the governments of some eu countries gave away free carbon pollution permits that exceeded the amount of pollution that was released - which the european environment commission has decided to put a stop to . germany was the most generous , with france and poland also handing out carbon credits faster than pollution can be emitted .
only a few countries - such as britain and ireland - distributed allowances that fairly matched the needs of big companies . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas criticized several european countries , including germany , greece , ireland , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia and sweden , for giving away too many pollution allowances that they hold in reserve for building new factories . " today 's decision sends a strong signal that europe is fully committed to achieving the kyoto target and making the eu ets a success , " dimas said in a statement . drastic reductions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the carbon trading scheme is working towards meeting kyoto targets stephan singer , the head of the european climate and energy policy unit in brussels for the wwf , was pleased that the allowances for germany to pollute have been reduced " quite drastically . " " germany has proposed that once it gets an allocation for a coal fire station , the allocation would be valid for the next 14 years at least - which the commission objected to , " singer said .
" this is particularly good , considering that germany is the largest oecd country in the european union . " singer said the wwf would like to see the commission " keep persistent and as straight forward , to help europe to deliver on its kyoto targets . " germany under fire over carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coal industry will probably be affected by the commissions ruling germany was the most generous with the emission credit surpluses , producing 21.4 million tons , or 4.3 percent less in emissions than its average annual cap allowance , according to a report in the new york times . france , germany , italy , poland , spain and uk make up for 73 percent of overall eu emissions .
singer said that the permits to pollute , based on an earlier draft by the german government , were " quite horrible . " for a country that wants to lead the world in climate change and renewable energy , its allowances to grow its coal base in the power sector are a scandalous proposal to the commission , " he said . the german coal industry has come out against the commissions stance , arguing that it will hurt the utilities sector . singer responded by saying that if the coal industry is complaining about the decision , then " i know that dimas has done the right thing . " the wwf wants to see the commission review allowing countries or coal-fired power stations to buy emissions , like through auctioning .

the scheme , established last year and ending in 2007 , aims to reduce carbon emissions by providing a market-based trading system .
it is based on limiting the total amount of co2 emissions , but can offer control over reductions flexibly and at a low-cost . it is designed to put caps on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by heavily polluting factories across europe .
but in 2006 , the governments of some eu countries gave away free carbon pollution permits that exceeded the amount of pollution that was released - which the european environment commission has decided to put a stop to . germany was the most generous , with france and poland also handing out carbon credits faster than pollution can be emitted .
only a few countries - such as britain and ireland - distributed allowances that fairly matched the needs of big companies . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas criticized several european countries , including germany , greece , ireland , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia and sweden , for giving away too many pollution allowances that they hold in reserve for building new factories . " today 's decision sends a strong signal that europe is fully committed to achieving the kyoto target and making the eu ets a success , " dimas said in a statement . drastic reductions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the carbon trading scheme is working towards meeting kyoto targets stephan singer , the head of the european climate and energy policy unit in brussels for the wwf , was pleased that the allowances for germany to pollute have been reduced " quite drastically . " " germany has proposed that once it gets an allocation for a coal fire station , the allocation would be valid for the next 14 years at least - which the commission objected to , " singer said .
" this is particularly good , considering that germany is the largest oecd country in the european union .

singer said that the permits to pollute , based on an earlier draft by the german government , were " quite horrible . " for a country that wants to lead the world in climate change and renewable energy , its allowances to grow its coal base in the power sector are a scandalous proposal to the commission , " he said . the german coal industry has come out against the commissions stance , arguing that it will hurt the utilities sector . singer responded by saying that if the coal industry is complaining about the decision , then " i know that dimas has done the right thing . " the wwf wants to see the commission review allowing countries or coal-fired power stations to buy emissions , like through auctioning .

the deutsche bank chief had agreed to pay the money - which amounts to three months ' of his current wages - out of his own pocket . charges were also dropped against the other five co-defendants , likewise in return for cash payments .
no verdict , no criminal record mannesmann 's former chairman , klaus esser , will have to fork out 1.5 million euros , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk 1.0 million euros , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel 60,000 euros and former works council members jürgen ladberg and dietmar droste will pay 30,000 euros and 12,500 euros respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , esser , funk , zwickel , from top left , clockwise under terms of the settlement , the men will not have a criminal record . the men had been accused of breach of fiduciary duty for their role in approving huge bonuses following the takeover of german telecom giant mannesmann in 2000 by british mobile phone giant vodafone .
they were accused of breaking the law by approving 111.5 million marks -lrb- 57 million euros -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives .
esser himself pocketed 16.4 million euros . the six men were originally acquitted in july 2004 .
but at the end of last year , the germany 's supreme court ordered a retrial , which opened just a month ago .
ethical can of worms the mannesmann case has not only put executive pay in germany in the spotlight .
it also raised ethical questions about what had been the successful transformation of mannesmann from an industrial conglomerate into a leading mobile telecommunications group . in the original trial , the court ruled that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . at the time of the mannesmann payouts , ackermann had been a member of the group 's supervisory board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense said the bonuses were a valid way to motivate company brass ackermann and his defense team argued that big payouts to executives , common in the united states and britain , were needed to motivate corporate leaders to take risks . after all , mannesmann had been transformed from a heavy engineering group into a telecommunications giant at the beginning of deregulation of telecommunications and the arrival of mobile telephones . esser argued during his trial that the price of shares in the company had doubled during his tenure . prosecutors contended that the payments were illegal because they were designed to persuade managers , and esser in particular , to drop their resistance to vodafone 's bid after a long takeover battle .
critics saw the bonuses , unprecedentedly high by german standards , as evidence of corporate greed , especially because many mannesmann employees were expected to lose their jobs as a result of the takeover . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

the deutsche bank chief had agreed to pay the money - which amounts to three months ' of his current wages - out of his own pocket . charges were also dropped against the other five co-defendants , likewise in return for cash payments .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , esser , funk , zwickel , from top left , clockwise under terms of the settlement , the men will not have a criminal record . the men had been accused of breach of fiduciary duty for their role in approving huge bonuses following the takeover of german telecom giant mannesmann in 2000 by british mobile phone giant vodafone .
they were accused of breaking the law by approving 111.5 million marks -lrb- 57 million euros -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives .
esser himself pocketed 16.4 million euros . the six men were originally acquitted in july 2004 .
but at the end of last year , the germany 's supreme court ordered a retrial , which opened just a month ago .
ethical can of worms the mannesmann case has not only put executive pay in germany in the spotlight .
it also raised ethical questions about what had been the successful transformation of mannesmann from an industrial conglomerate into a leading mobile telecommunications group . in the original trial , the court ruled that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . at the time of the mannesmann payouts , ackermann had been a member of the group 's supervisory board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense said the bonuses were a valid way to motivate company brass ackermann and his defense team argued that big payouts to executives , common in the united states and britain , were needed to motivate corporate leaders to take risks . after all , mannesmann had been transformed from a heavy engineering group into a telecommunications giant at the beginning of deregulation of telecommunications and the arrival of mobile telephones . esser argued during his trial that the price of shares in the company had doubled during his tenure . prosecutors contended that the payments were illegal because they were designed to persuade managers , and esser in particular , to drop their resistance to vodafone 's bid after a long takeover battle .
critics saw the bonuses , unprecedentedly high by german standards , as evidence of corporate greed , especially because many mannesmann employees were expected to lose their jobs as a result of the takeover . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

a new eu report sheds some light germany and 10 other states knew about secret cia prisons in europe , and obstructed investigations into the case , the european parliament said in a report . there were 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe , a european parliament committee said in a draft report on tuesday . " many governments cooperated passively or actively -lrb- with the cia -rrb- , " the committee 's rapporteur claudio fava said .
" they knew . " the draft , which was based on classified documents and secret informants , noted at least at least 1,245 suspicious flights through european air space or stopovers at european airports that took place at the request of the cia . the report was the result of an investigation by a special committee of the european parliament into " extraordinary rendition " - the us practice of transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for questioning . extraordinary rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report took the eu 's javier solana to task human rights groups accuse the united states of having used extraordinary rendition in order to interrogate suspected terrorists under methods not allowed in the us itself , including torture . the german government has dismissed the report , which came out tuesday .
the eu committee also claimed austria , great britain , italy , poland , sweden , ireland , spain , portugal , greece and cyprus knew about the prisons . the report urged officials in the individual eu countries to start their own investigations as to whether their governments have broken european human rights accords with their use of extraordinary rendition . it also criticizes eu foreign policy chief javier solana and anti-terror coordinator gijs de vries , accusing them of having given incomplete statements to the investigating committee . failure to cooperate the report was especially critical of solana , expressing its " profound preoccupation " with the " omissions " and " denials " when the eu 's top diplomat appeared before the committee , in may . germany and spain were the only countries fava said adequately cooperated with eu committee 's investigation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 29.11.2006 nato decides to bolster troubled afghan force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan remains at the top of nato 's priority list nato clinched an agreement wednesday to bolster its troubled mission in afghanistan by sending more troops and cutting restrictions on forces already there , while admitting that gaps remain . leaders of the 26-nation bloc , including us president george w. bush , also backed a french proposal to set up a " contact group " to coordinate action to prevent afghanistan slipping back toward chaos . closer to its traditional home ground , the leaders also agreed to admit serbia , montenegro and bosnia-herzegovina to its partnership for peace program , a decade after the wars that ripped the balkans apart . the pledge on afghanistan , announced at the end of a two-day summit in riga , came after the united states and britain in particular lobbied for more troops and fewer caveats on the forces in the violence-wracked country .
european heavyweight states like germany , france , spain and italy came under pressure to do more in southern afghanistan , where british-led troops have faced a growing death toll in fighting against taliban insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the chances for success in afghanistan had risen thanks to the summit chancellor angela merkel after the summit stressed that germany 's contribution to the afghanistan mission was highly valued by its nato partners .
she had also once more assured alliance members that germany would come to nato 's aid in emergencies beyond the locations where the bundeswehr is deployed . she added that solidarity demanded it and that it was clear " germany would n't close its eyes to this solidarity . " as an example , she suggested evacuating wounded soldiers from other nato states .
question of credibility nato took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in 2003 .
it currently comprises some 32,000 troops from 37 nations .
isaf has , however , faced increasingly fierce fighting since moving into the volatile south this year , and in september nato 's top commander us general james jones called for 2,500 extra military personnel . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the agreement on afghanistan . " everyone accepts this is nato 's absolutely critical mission , " he said .
" there is complete agreement around the table that nato 's credibility is ... on the line . " but he also admitted that shortfalls remained , with military chiefs saying that so far 85-90 percent of requirements were in place . " we have made significant progress but we still need to make those last remaining steps , " blair said . rapid reaction force nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer highlighted an agreement to deploy forces to help out in emergencies .
" in an emergency ... they will support each other , " he said .
" that is the most fundamental demonstration of nato 's solidarity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer the nato secretary general also confirmed that alliance leaders had supported french president jacques chirac 's proposal to establish an afghan " contact group . "
this could be along the lines of such a group set up for the balkans in the 1990s , comprising the united states , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , to coordinate diplomatic and other action to resolve the conflict . " i have been tasked ... to think about and to forward proposals on the possibility of a contact group for afghanistan , " de hoop scheffer added . overall , he said the nato summit was good news for the people of afghanistan , " the bottom line is that , five years after the fall of the taliban , afghanistan is making progress . "
" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself . " taking into account the importance of long-term stability in the western balkans and acknowledging the progress made so far ... we have invited these three countries to join partnership for peace , " said the nato declaration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was high for the summit and riga 's old town was almost deserted chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte criticized the invitation to the three states , her spokesman said after the summit . " the prosecutor regrets this decision because it looks like a reward for the lack of cooperation ... with the office of the prosecutor , " the spokesman , anton nikiforov , told reporters . nato leaders also decided to invite new countries to join the alliance without naming any country best placed to become a member . " at our next summit in 2008 , the alliance intends to extend further invitations to those countries who meet nato 's performance-based standards and are able to contribute to euro-atlantic security and stability , " they said . also in riga , the nato chiefs declared " fully operational " the alliance 's flagship 25,000-strong nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- .
the force , to be staffed by nato countries on a six-month rotating basis , will stand ready to be deployed within five days for combat missions , evacuations or disaster relief operations lasting for up to a month . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " in afghanistan , damage limitation is the only realistic option " nato 's mission in afghanistan has n't been a failure , but it still could be , cambridge university political scientist christopher hill told dw-world.de. -lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

european heavyweight states like germany , france , spain and italy came under pressure to do more in southern afghanistan , where british-led troops have faced a growing death toll in fighting against taliban insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the chances for success in afghanistan had risen thanks to the summit chancellor angela merkel after the summit stressed that germany 's contribution to the afghanistan mission was highly valued by its nato partners .
she had also once more assured alliance members that germany would come to nato 's aid in emergencies beyond the locations where the bundeswehr is deployed . she added that solidarity demanded it and that it was clear " germany would n't close its eyes to this solidarity . " as an example , she suggested evacuating wounded soldiers from other nato states .
question of credibility nato took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in 2003 .
it currently comprises some 32,000 troops from 37 nations .
isaf has , however , faced increasingly fierce fighting since moving into the volatile south this year , and in september nato 's top commander us general james jones called for 2,500 extra military personnel . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the agreement on afghanistan . " everyone accepts this is nato 's absolutely critical mission , " he said .
" there is complete agreement around the table that nato 's credibility is ... on the line . " but he also admitted that shortfalls remained , with military chiefs saying that so far 85-90 percent of requirements were in place . " we have made significant progress but we still need to make those last remaining steps , " blair said . rapid reaction force nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer highlighted an agreement to deploy forces to help out in emergencies .
" in an emergency ... they will support each other , " he said .
" that is the most fundamental demonstration of nato 's solidarity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer the nato secretary general also confirmed that alliance leaders had supported french president jacques chirac 's proposal to establish an afghan " contact group . "
this could be along the lines of such a group set up for the balkans in the 1990s , comprising the united states , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , to coordinate diplomatic and other action to resolve the conflict . " i have been tasked ... to think about and to forward proposals on the possibility of a contact group for afghanistan , " de hoop scheffer added . overall , he said the nato summit was good news for the people of afghanistan , " the bottom line is that , five years after the fall of the taliban , afghanistan is making progress . "
" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself . " taking into account the importance of long-term stability in the western balkans and acknowledging the progress made so far ... we have invited these three countries to join partnership for peace , " said the nato declaration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was high for the summit and riga 's old town was almost deserted chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte criticized the invitation to the three states , her spokesman said after the summit . " the prosecutor regrets this decision because it looks like a reward for the lack of cooperation ... with the office of the prosecutor , " the spokesman , anton nikiforov , told reporters . nato leaders also decided to invite new countries to join the alliance without naming any country best placed to become a member . " at our next summit in 2008 , the alliance intends to extend further invitations to those countries who meet nato 's performance-based standards and are able to contribute to euro-atlantic security and stability , " they said . also in riga , the nato chiefs declared " fully operational " the alliance 's flagship 25,000-strong nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- .
the force , to be staffed by nato countries on a six-month rotating basis , will stand ready to be deployed within five days for combat missions , evacuations or disaster relief operations lasting for up to a month . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " in afghanistan , damage limitation is the only realistic option " nato 's mission in afghanistan has n't been a failure , but it still could be , cambridge university political scientist christopher hill told dw-world.de. -lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

the deutsche bank chief had agreed to pay the money - which amounts to three months ' of his current wages - out of his own pocket . charges were also dropped against the other five co-defendants , likewise in return for cash payments .
no verdict , no criminal record mannesmann 's former chairman , klaus esser , will have to fork out 1.5 million euros , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk 1.0 million euros , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel 60,000 euros and former works council members jürgen ladberg and dietmar droste will pay 30,000 euros and 12,500 euros respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , esser , funk , zwickel , from top left , clockwise under terms of the settlement , the men will not have a criminal record . the men had been accused of breach of fiduciary duty for their role in approving huge bonuses following the takeover of german telecom giant mannesmann in 2000 by british mobile phone giant vodafone .
they were accused of breaking the law by approving 111.5 million marks -lrb- 57 million euros -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives .
esser himself pocketed 16.4 million euros . the six men were originally acquitted in july 2004 .
but at the end of last year , the germany 's supreme court ordered a retrial , which opened just a month ago .
ethical can of worms the mannesmann case has not only put executive pay in germany in the spotlight .
it also raised ethical questions about what had been the successful transformation of mannesmann from an industrial conglomerate into a leading mobile telecommunications group . in the original trial , the court ruled that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . at the time of the mannesmann payouts , ackermann had been a member of the group 's supervisory board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense said the bonuses were a valid way to motivate company brass ackermann and his defense team argued that big payouts to executives , common in the united states and britain , were needed to motivate corporate leaders to take risks . after all , mannesmann had been transformed from a heavy engineering group into a telecommunications giant at the beginning of deregulation of telecommunications and the arrival of mobile telephones . esser argued during his trial that the price of shares in the company had doubled during his tenure . prosecutors contended that the payments were illegal because they were designed to persuade managers , and esser in particular , to drop their resistance to vodafone 's bid after a long takeover battle .
critics saw the bonuses , unprecedentedly high by german standards , as evidence of corporate greed , especially because many mannesmann employees were expected to lose their jobs as a result of the takeover . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

they might be invading your playground any day now the bavarian city of nuremberg is planning to open an exclusive playground for senior citizens .
are the elderly - and young people alike - in germany ready for this new chapter in the war between generations ? senior citizens are a highly misunderstood group of germans .
their sole purpose in life is not - despite what many people think - to shut down their young neighbor 's parties by calling the police , to grumble about dog poop in the streets , or throw hysterical fits if their train arrives five minutes behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , the founding mother of gray panthers , is 81 senior citizens are also politically conscious and active people .
last year , a german activist group called gray panthers celebrated its 30th anniversary of fighting for senior rights .
in 1989 , the gray panthers even established a political wing - the grays - a party whose results usually appeared as an invisible condiment on the smallest slice of an election pie-chart marked " others . " but even the grays ' political invisibility seems to be becoming a thing of the past .
in the last municipal elections in berlin , the grays won the unprecedented 3.8 percent of the votes .
german seniors are coming .
with a vengeance . let 's play clever politicians know how to spot trends early .
that is why the bavarian city of nuremberg decided to jump on the bandwagon of senior renaissance and open a senior citizens ' playground , where grandmas and grandpas could get together to bowl , play chess or simply hang out with their peers .
if you 're under 60 : tough luck !
you 'll have to look for friends elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do they have to be that loud ?
" it will be a place where the senior generation can find a refuge from younger people , " said deputy mayor horst förther , who is also in charge of sport activities in the city .
" we agreed that it was a good idea , given our demographic changes . " the project in nuremberg was inspired by research from the finnish university of lapland .
the experiments with what finnish researchers called " three-generational play " showed that senior citizens experienced significant improvements in balance , co-ordination and speed after only three months of " playing . " dangers ahead " i am considering a running track , a path for roller-skating , a soft badminton court and a trampoline , which is easy on the joints , " förther said .
" all activities can be carried out slowly so that the old people are n't pushed beyond their limits . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is munch 's " scream " about modernist angst or a child off a trampoline ?
parents who ever made the fatal mistake of purchasing a trampoline for their children - losing , as a consequence , the peace of their mind and the quiet of their garden - would beg to differ .
a trampoline may be easy on the joints , but it is known to produce an adrenaline rush in children on pair with bungee jumping off the chinese yangtze river tamer known as the three gorges dam .
it turns children into wild , uncontrollable , self-sustainable noise-machines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 29.11.2006 nato decides to bolster troubled afghan force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan remains at the top of nato 's priority list nato clinched an agreement wednesday to bolster its troubled mission in afghanistan by sending more troops and cutting restrictions on forces already there , while admitting that gaps remain . leaders of the 26-nation bloc , including us president george w. bush , also backed a french proposal to set up a " contact group " to coordinate action to prevent afghanistan slipping back toward chaos . closer to its traditional home ground , the leaders also agreed to admit serbia , montenegro and bosnia-herzegovina to its partnership for peace program , a decade after the wars that ripped the balkans apart . the pledge on afghanistan , announced at the end of a two-day summit in riga , came after the united states and britain in particular lobbied for more troops and fewer caveats on the forces in the violence-wracked country .
european heavyweight states like germany , france , spain and italy came under pressure to do more in southern afghanistan , where british-led troops have faced a growing death toll in fighting against taliban insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the chances for success in afghanistan had risen thanks to the summit chancellor angela merkel after the summit stressed that germany 's contribution to the afghanistan mission was highly valued by its nato partners .
she had also once more assured alliance members that germany would come to nato 's aid in emergencies beyond the locations where the bundeswehr is deployed . she added that solidarity demanded it and that it was clear " germany would n't close its eyes to this solidarity . " as an example , she suggested evacuating wounded soldiers from other nato states .
question of credibility nato took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in 2003 .
it currently comprises some 32,000 troops from 37 nations .
isaf has , however , faced increasingly fierce fighting since moving into the volatile south this year , and in september nato 's top commander us general james jones called for 2,500 extra military personnel . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the agreement on afghanistan . " everyone accepts this is nato 's absolutely critical mission , " he said .

isaf has , however , faced increasingly fierce fighting since moving into the volatile south this year , and in september nato 's top commander us general james jones called for 2,500 extra military personnel . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the agreement on afghanistan . " everyone accepts this is nato 's absolutely critical mission , " he said .
" there is complete agreement around the table that nato 's credibility is ... on the line . " but he also admitted that shortfalls remained , with military chiefs saying that so far 85-90 percent of requirements were in place . " we have made significant progress but we still need to make those last remaining steps , " blair said . rapid reaction force nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer highlighted an agreement to deploy forces to help out in emergencies .
" in an emergency ... they will support each other , " he said .
" that is the most fundamental demonstration of nato 's solidarity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer the nato secretary general also confirmed that alliance leaders had supported french president jacques chirac 's proposal to establish an afghan " contact group . "
this could be along the lines of such a group set up for the balkans in the 1990s , comprising the united states , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , to coordinate diplomatic and other action to resolve the conflict . " i have been tasked ... to think about and to forward proposals on the possibility of a contact group for afghanistan , " de hoop scheffer added . overall , he said the nato summit was good news for the people of afghanistan , " the bottom line is that , five years after the fall of the taliban , afghanistan is making progress . "
" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself . " taking into account the importance of long-term stability in the western balkans and acknowledging the progress made so far ... we have invited these three countries to join partnership for peace , " said the nato declaration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was high for the summit and riga 's old town was almost deserted chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte criticized the invitation to the three states , her spokesman said after the summit . " the prosecutor regrets this decision because it looks like a reward for the lack of cooperation ... with the office of the prosecutor , " the spokesman , anton nikiforov , told reporters . nato leaders also decided to invite new countries to join the alliance without naming any country best placed to become a member . " at our next summit in 2008 , the alliance intends to extend further invitations to those countries who meet nato 's performance-based standards and are able to contribute to euro-atlantic security and stability , " they said . also in riga , the nato chiefs declared " fully operational " the alliance 's flagship 25,000-strong nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- .
the force , to be staffed by nato countries on a six-month rotating basis , will stand ready to be deployed within five days for combat missions , evacuations or disaster relief operations lasting for up to a month . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " in afghanistan , damage limitation is the only realistic option " nato 's mission in afghanistan has n't been a failure , but it still could be , cambridge university political scientist christopher hill told dw-world.de. -lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

the plant which employs 900 people would then be dismantled and rebuilt elsewhere by 2015 . the final details will be worked out over the next months but fraport has already agreed to recompense celanese with a sum of 650 million euros -lrb- $ 855 million -rrb- .
some 20 million euros will be paid to the chemicals company as early as this year . objections due to security and environmental risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forests will have to be destroyed so the airport can expand ticona had originally objected to fraport 's plans because they feared it would represent a security risk to have jets flying in and taking off at heights of just 70 meters -lrb- 76 yards -rrb- over the chemicals factory . environmental protection groups also oppose the plan because it will require the clearance of over 160 hectares of protected forest , as well as entail increased noise pollution for nearby inhabitants . however , fraport saw ticona 's security objections as a more serious threat to its expansion plans , which are supported by hesse 's regional state premier roland koch and have been floating around for over 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's second-busiest airport frankfurt 's airport authority insists that the construction of a fourth runway is vital to its plans to expand europe 's second-busiest airport after london heathrow and secure thousands of jobs in the region .
while air traffic in europe continues to expand massively , frankfurt airport is already operating at the limit of its capacity .
fraport argues that an extra runway could boost capacity by half and the company is also planning to build a third terminal .
it hopes that the new runway will be operational by 2010 . the total investment required for the group 's expansion plans is thought to be about 3.2 billion euros . relocation of ticona plant means loss of jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fraport wants to avoid scenes such as these the frankfurter rundschau daily reported that the ticona plant would be relocated to a nearby suburb of frankfurt , where celanese 's parent company hoechst was originally located .
a spokesman for celanese declined to comment but insisted the plant would remain in germany . the hesse region 's opposition spd and green parties were critical of the deal , saying that thousands of jobs would be axed as part of the relocation . under the terms of the deal , fraport has agreed to set up an employment company for ticona employees who can not be transferred .
the hesse authorities will also be involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stock exchange in frankfurt " the fact that an employment company is being set up is a clear sign of what 's to come , " said the greens ' chief whip frank kaufmann .
he said that it made no economic sense to expand an airport in such a densely-populated area . however , fraport chairman william bender welcomed the deal in the name of common sense . " time is money , " he said .
" and every day that global air traffic flies past us is a lost day for our company and our employees , as well as for the region and the people who live here . " although investors are in favor of the expansion plans , they appeared concerned by the costs .

the scheme , established last year and ending in 2007 , aims to reduce carbon emissions by providing a market-based trading system .
it is based on limiting the total amount of co2 emissions , but can offer control over reductions flexibly and at a low-cost . it is designed to put caps on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by heavily polluting factories across europe .
but in 2006 , the governments of some eu countries gave away free carbon pollution permits that exceeded the amount of pollution that was released - which the european environment commission has decided to put a stop to . germany was the most generous , with france and poland also handing out carbon credits faster than pollution can be emitted .
only a few countries - such as britain and ireland - distributed allowances that fairly matched the needs of big companies . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas criticized several european countries , including germany , greece , ireland , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia and sweden , for giving away too many pollution allowances that they hold in reserve for building new factories . " today 's decision sends a strong signal that europe is fully committed to achieving the kyoto target and making the eu ets a success , " dimas said in a statement . drastic reductions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the carbon trading scheme is working towards meeting kyoto targets stephan singer , the head of the european climate and energy policy unit in brussels for the wwf , was pleased that the allowances for germany to pollute have been reduced " quite drastically . " " germany has proposed that once it gets an allocation for a coal fire station , the allocation would be valid for the next 14 years at least - which the commission objected to , " singer said .
" this is particularly good , considering that germany is the largest oecd country in the european union . " singer said the wwf would like to see the commission " keep persistent and as straight forward , to help europe to deliver on its kyoto targets . " germany under fire over carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coal industry will probably be affected by the commissions ruling germany was the most generous with the emission credit surpluses , producing 21.4 million tons , or 4.3 percent less in emissions than its average annual cap allowance , according to a report in the new york times . france , germany , italy , poland , spain and uk make up for 73 percent of overall eu emissions .
singer said that the permits to pollute , based on an earlier draft by the german government , were " quite horrible . " for a country that wants to lead the world in climate change and renewable energy , its allowances to grow its coal base in the power sector are a scandalous proposal to the commission , " he said . the german coal industry has come out against the commissions stance , arguing that it will hurt the utilities sector . singer responded by saying that if the coal industry is complaining about the decision , then " i know that dimas has done the right thing . " the wwf wants to see the commission review allowing countries or coal-fired power stations to buy emissions , like through auctioning .

aspirin is expensive and hard to buy in germany for decades , germany 's restrictive laws have limited the selling of medications only to pharmacies , which must be personally run by registered pharmacy owners . though european countries have been deregulating everything from telecommunications to postal services and railways , german lawmakers have been reluctant to tamper with the pill market , resulting in protection against competition among pharmacies and continued high prices . as of 2004 , however , pharmacists are now allowed to own not just one , but up to three of their own stores . risky business pharmacists generally support limited access to medication , saying that it ensures public safety . " even minor painkillers contain risks and should only be sold by pharmacists who provide information on them and who sell them only in limited amounts , " said ursula sellerberg , a spokeswoman for the federation of german pharmacists ' associations -lrb- abda -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the sugar to make the medicine go down ?

" we 're encouraging pharmacists to advise even for ' lighter ' medications , " she added . gaining ground chain drug stores where consumers can buy inexpensive over-the-counter medication or prescription drugs provided by a trained pharmacist have been non-existent in germany .
there 's no riteaid , no cvs , no duane read - to name some of the us 's largest retailers . that has begun to change over the past few months .
in july , former software engineer ralf däinghaus opened a docmorris - europe 's largest mail-order medication firm based in the netherlands - pharmacy in saarbrücken .
thus ensued a debate over whether germany should permit retail drug chains . on the one hand , german pharmacists say docmorris was violating german law , which forbids corporations from owning pharmacies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris store in saarbrücken in august on the other hand , saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the dutch docmorris to open shop in saarbrücken , said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law . " penny-pinchers some customers in saarbrücken were delighted , saying they could save up to 30 percent on prescription and over-the counter drugs at docmorris .
and they 're not cheap at traditional pharmacies : there a package of 20 brand-name aspirin tablets costs just under five euros -lrb- around $ 6.50 -rrb- , though a generic version of 30 tablets costs around half that . ralph däinghaus was proud to announce double the number of sales in the first month of opening the saarbrücken store , as compared to sales by the former pharmacy store he took over there . he " expected success , " he told germany 's tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- daily , because medication costs in germany are " scandalous " compared to france and belgium , where the same drugs cost half the price , taz wrote . german pharmacists were less than thrilled , however , and began worrying that their livelihoods were at stake and patients at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a " for apotheke or " pharmacy " däinghaus has also been in and out of court since july , with three saarbrücken pharmacists and two german pharmacy associations - who contested docmorris - eventually chalking up a victory when the saarland district court ordered the docmorris store in germany to be closed . " the decision was right based on german law , " said vogel , " but it is very likely that docmorris will go all the way to the european court of justice with countersuits and that the ban will be reversed and drug prices will eventually change in germany . " reform headaches in berlin , lawmakers plan to install a price cap on prescription drugs ; pharmacies could lower prices , but not raise them .
and , since only pharmacies are permitted to supply hospitals with drugs , politicians believe cheaper medication could also mean drastic savings in germany 's flailing public health care system . " but pharmacy costs make up only 2.7 percent of all the expenses of the public health care system , " said abda 's sellerberg .
" that 's only half of what the public insurance schemes need for their administrative tasks . " traditional pharmacists have been up-in-arms .
throughout november , thousands of them have staged protests across germany against health care reforms which they say threaten their existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional pharmacy in germany reform plans include a clause in which pharmacists would be expected to negotiate rebates between insurance groups and pharmaceutical manufacturers .
should they fail , pharmacists would have to contribute 500 millions euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- from their own pockets to the government . abda maintains this is unfair since costs for insurance companies have risen not because pharmacists maintain high prices , but because 80 percent of what public health insurers pay for patients ' medications goes to pharmaceutical manufacturers and taxes . kai vogel believes it 's only a matter of time until germany changes its ways and starts allowing more competition .

thus ensued a debate over whether germany should permit retail drug chains . on the one hand , german pharmacists say docmorris was violating german law , which forbids corporations from owning pharmacies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris store in saarbrücken in august on the other hand , saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the dutch docmorris to open shop in saarbrücken , said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law . " penny-pinchers some customers in saarbrücken were delighted , saying they could save up to 30 percent on prescription and over-the counter drugs at docmorris .
and they 're not cheap at traditional pharmacies : there a package of 20 brand-name aspirin tablets costs just under five euros -lrb- around $ 6.50 -rrb- , though a generic version of 30 tablets costs around half that . ralph däinghaus was proud to announce double the number of sales in the first month of opening the saarbrücken store , as compared to sales by the former pharmacy store he took over there . he " expected success , " he told germany 's tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- daily , because medication costs in germany are " scandalous " compared to france and belgium , where the same drugs cost half the price , taz wrote . german pharmacists were less than thrilled , however , and began worrying that their livelihoods were at stake and patients at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a " for apotheke or " pharmacy " däinghaus has also been in and out of court since july , with three saarbrücken pharmacists and two german pharmacy associations - who contested docmorris - eventually chalking up a victory when the saarland district court ordered the docmorris store in germany to be closed . " the decision was right based on german law , " said vogel , " but it is very likely that docmorris will go all the way to the european court of justice with countersuits and that the ban will be reversed and drug prices will eventually change in germany . " reform headaches in berlin , lawmakers plan to install a price cap on prescription drugs ; pharmacies could lower prices , but not raise them .
and , since only pharmacies are permitted to supply hospitals with drugs , politicians believe cheaper medication could also mean drastic savings in germany 's flailing public health care system .

only pharmacies run by certified pharmacy owners may sell medicinal drugs , but the meds monopoly has been getting a run for its money of late . got an excruciating headache ?
need an aspirin lickety-split ?
well , if you 're in germany and it 's a sunday , forget about grabbing a bottle of over-the-counter painkillers at the grocery store . not only are german grocery stores not open sundays , you wo n't find aspirin there anyway .
unless you have friends or neighbors with aspirin on hand , you 'll just have to wrestle with the hellish mindgrip unless you 're willing to shlep around town to find the emergency pharmacy on duty . limited access , high prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head ready to explode ?
aspirin is expensive and hard to buy in germany for decades , germany 's restrictive laws have limited the selling of medications only to pharmacies , which must be personally run by registered pharmacy owners . though european countries have been deregulating everything from telecommunications to postal services and railways , german lawmakers have been reluctant to tamper with the pill market , resulting in protection against competition among pharmacies and continued high prices . as of 2004 , however , pharmacists are now allowed to own not just one , but up to three of their own stores . risky business pharmacists generally support limited access to medication , saying that it ensures public safety . " even minor painkillers contain risks and should only be sold by pharmacists who provide information on them and who sell them only in limited amounts , " said ursula sellerberg , a spokeswoman for the federation of german pharmacists ' associations -lrb- abda -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the sugar to make the medicine go down ?
still , " liberalization of who sells medication would mean greater competition and pharmacies would be forced to lower prices , " said kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . vogel said german consumer protection agencies , however , are advocating that pharmacies should still be required to provide information about medication risk . sellerberg , for her part , pointed out that stomach problems from mere aspirin can occur when taken in high doses . " we 're encouraging pharmacists to advise even for ' lighter ' medications , " she added . gaining ground chain drug stores where consumers can buy inexpensive over-the-counter medication or prescription drugs provided by a trained pharmacist have been non-existent in germany .
there 's no riteaid , no cvs , no duane read - to name some of the us 's largest retailers . that has begun to change over the past few months .

" but it 's significantly less expensive to cook yourself , especially if you shop a bit price-consciously , " kuchenbecker said .
" it 's our job to relay these skills to these women . " battling the bulge with healthy cooking every fifth german is too fat , according to the world health organization .

but she wants to change her eating habits , she said . " i want to learn something about cooking and nutrition because it 's important for my daughter , " katja said .
her daughter is three years old and already slightly chubby .
katja 's unhealthy diet over the past years is evident in her figure , too . " i usually go to a snack bar or get pizza , " katja said .
but here , she has learned that homemade pizza , for example , only costs about a third of frozen pizza . cooking can spice up life instructor kuchenbecker said she wants to motivate these women to try out new things , such as using a different spice or tasting another type of salad .

" i 'm going to make my own dressing from now on . " cooking can boost self-confidence but the hamburg course is about more than just affordable meals , kuchenbecker said .
it 's also about motivation .
a lot of these women have never gotten any confirmation in their lives .

socially disadvantaged families are particularly prone to such diets .
but a cooking course in hamburg hopes to change that . a cooking project in the hamburg neighborhood jensfeld , home to a large number of socially underprivileged families , is helping women rethink their families ' diets and start preparing more home-cooked meals . once a week for three hours , the participants learn how to whip up delicious healthy meals with little effort and a small budget .
home economics teacher sabine kuchenbecker said a lot of people do n't know that fast food is n't only unhealthy , it 's also expensive . she said a lot of young women who never learned how to cook automatically think it 's cheaper to buy ready-to-serve meals . " but it 's significantly less expensive to cook yourself , especially if you shop a bit price-consciously , " kuchenbecker said .
" it 's our job to relay these skills to these women . " battling the bulge with healthy cooking every fifth german is too fat , according to the world health organization .
this trend is particularly prominent among underprivileged families , which tend to eat fast food or ready-to-serve meals .
the results are serious health problems , such as diabetes at a young age , stiffening of the joints or even cardiovascular diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast food can lead to serious health problems for children the charity hamburger tafel or hamburg table is coordinating the project , which costs five euros -lrb- $ 6.60 -rrb- for the five-week course . for the participants , healthy is n't always easy to get used to , though .
the 33-year-old single mother katja does n't like mustard and turns her nose up as she takes a sniff of walnut oil to make homemade salad dressing . " well , it 's okay , but i think it 's a matter of taste , " katja said , who usually buys finished products , such as french dressing , which has lots of preservatives and is more fattening than homemade dressing . women like katja are common in neighborhoods like this .
but she wants to change her eating habits , she said . " i want to learn something about cooking and nutrition because it 's important for my daughter , " katja said .
her daughter is three years old and already slightly chubby .
katja 's unhealthy diet over the past years is evident in her figure , too . " i usually go to a snack bar or get pizza , " katja said .
but here , she has learned that homemade pizza , for example , only costs about a third of frozen pizza . cooking can spice up life instructor kuchenbecker said she wants to motivate these women to try out new things , such as using a different spice or tasting another type of salad .
participant gaby is taking the course for the second time and has learned a lot .
the 43-year-old mother of nine still has four children living at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetables are a healthy and affordable alternative to fast food " my kitchen always just had salt , pepper and paprika as spices , " gaby said .
" i did n't dare to try anything else .
now , when i make a soup , i put in oregano and thyme and it really tastes better to me . " even katja has tried her first homemade dressing with mustard and walnut oil , and it 's was n't bad , she said . " it tastes good now that i 've tried it , " katja said .
" i 'm going to make my own dressing from now on . " cooking can boost self-confidence but the hamburg course is about more than just affordable meals , kuchenbecker said .
it 's also about motivation .
a lot of these women have never gotten any confirmation in their lives .
many did poorly in school , for example . " when you simply say to them , ' wow , you did that well ' or ' you did a super job seasoning that , ' they really beam at you , as they 've maybe never heard that before in their lives , " kuchenbecker said . so that the women do n't forget what they 've learned , every participant gets a goodie bag at the end of the course .

critics saw the bonuses , unprecedentedly high by german standards , as evidence of corporate greed , especially because many mannesmann employees were expected to lose their jobs as a result of the takeover . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

a new eu report sheds some light germany and 10 other states knew about secret cia prisons in europe , and obstructed investigations into the case , the european parliament said in a report . there were 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe , a european parliament committee said in a draft report on tuesday . " many governments cooperated passively or actively -lrb- with the cia -rrb- , " the committee 's rapporteur claudio fava said .
" they knew . " the draft , which was based on classified documents and secret informants , noted at least at least 1,245 suspicious flights through european air space or stopovers at european airports that took place at the request of the cia . the report was the result of an investigation by a special committee of the european parliament into " extraordinary rendition " - the us practice of transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for questioning . extraordinary rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report took the eu 's javier solana to task human rights groups accuse the united states of having used extraordinary rendition in order to interrogate suspected terrorists under methods not allowed in the us itself , including torture . the german government has dismissed the report , which came out tuesday .
the eu committee also claimed austria , great britain , italy , poland , sweden , ireland , spain , portugal , greece and cyprus knew about the prisons . the report urged officials in the individual eu countries to start their own investigations as to whether their governments have broken european human rights accords with their use of extraordinary rendition . it also criticizes eu foreign policy chief javier solana and anti-terror coordinator gijs de vries , accusing them of having given incomplete statements to the investigating committee . failure to cooperate the report was especially critical of solana , expressing its " profound preoccupation " with the " omissions " and " denials " when the eu 's top diplomat appeared before the committee , in may . germany and spain were the only countries fava said adequately cooperated with eu committee 's investigation .
fava offered little in the way of conclusions , simply inviting the eu authorities to " accept their responsibilities " to deal with the offending member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri wants an apology from the cia meanwhile , a us appeals court in the state of virginia has agreed to hear the case of german-lebanese citizen khaled el-masri against ex-cia chief george tenet .
el-masri accused the cia of taking prison in afghanistan , where he was allegedly beaten , in a case of mistaken identity . el-masri is seeking damages of at least $ 75,000 -lrb- 57,142 euros -rrb- on allegations of unlawful capture , imprisonment , torture and other human rights violations .
a decision is expected next week , a spokesman for the richmond court said . in may , a lower us court had refused to hear the case that sparked a parliamentary investigation in germany , saying it would uncover state secrets and thus endanger the public . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators examine possibility of secret us prison in germany german federal prosecutors announced saturday that they are looking into claims of human rights violations stemming from the alleged detention of terror suspects at secret us prisons in germany .

the scheme , established last year and ending in 2007 , aims to reduce carbon emissions by providing a market-based trading system .
it is based on limiting the total amount of co2 emissions , but can offer control over reductions flexibly and at a low-cost . it is designed to put caps on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by heavily polluting factories across europe .
but in 2006 , the governments of some eu countries gave away free carbon pollution permits that exceeded the amount of pollution that was released - which the european environment commission has decided to put a stop to . germany was the most generous , with france and poland also handing out carbon credits faster than pollution can be emitted .
only a few countries - such as britain and ireland - distributed allowances that fairly matched the needs of big companies . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas criticized several european countries , including germany , greece , ireland , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia and sweden , for giving away too many pollution allowances that they hold in reserve for building new factories . " today 's decision sends a strong signal that europe is fully committed to achieving the kyoto target and making the eu ets a success , " dimas said in a statement . drastic reductions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the carbon trading scheme is working towards meeting kyoto targets stephan singer , the head of the european climate and energy policy unit in brussels for the wwf , was pleased that the allowances for germany to pollute have been reduced " quite drastically . " " germany has proposed that once it gets an allocation for a coal fire station , the allocation would be valid for the next 14 years at least - which the commission objected to , " singer said .
" this is particularly good , considering that germany is the largest oecd country in the european union . " singer said the wwf would like to see the commission " keep persistent and as straight forward , to help europe to deliver on its kyoto targets . " germany under fire over carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coal industry will probably be affected by the commissions ruling germany was the most generous with the emission credit surpluses , producing 21.4 million tons , or 4.3 percent less in emissions than its average annual cap allowance , according to a report in the new york times . france , germany , italy , poland , spain and uk make up for 73 percent of overall eu emissions .
singer said that the permits to pollute , based on an earlier draft by the german government , were " quite horrible . " for a country that wants to lead the world in climate change and renewable energy , its allowances to grow its coal base in the power sector are a scandalous proposal to the commission , " he said . the german coal industry has come out against the commissions stance , arguing that it will hurt the utilities sector . singer responded by saying that if the coal industry is complaining about the decision , then " i know that dimas has done the right thing . " the wwf wants to see the commission review allowing countries or coal-fired power stations to buy emissions , like through auctioning . " auctioning of pollution permits would represent the ' polluter pays principle ' and the money then could be re-invested into climate protection measures , " he said . rachel ryan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister presses climate change action in wake of dire report on the heels of a major study that says world leaders must act urgently to avert a looming environmental catastrophe , germany 's environment minister has called on the country to invest heavily in green technology .

the scheme , established last year and ending in 2007 , aims to reduce carbon emissions by providing a market-based trading system .
it is based on limiting the total amount of co2 emissions , but can offer control over reductions flexibly and at a low-cost . it is designed to put caps on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by heavily polluting factories across europe .
but in 2006 , the governments of some eu countries gave away free carbon pollution permits that exceeded the amount of pollution that was released - which the european environment commission has decided to put a stop to . germany was the most generous , with france and poland also handing out carbon credits faster than pollution can be emitted .
only a few countries - such as britain and ireland - distributed allowances that fairly matched the needs of big companies . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas criticized several european countries , including germany , greece , ireland , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia and sweden , for giving away too many pollution allowances that they hold in reserve for building new factories .

singer said that the permits to pollute , based on an earlier draft by the german government , were " quite horrible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.11.2006 deutsche bank chief walks free in mannesmann trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial went ackermann 's way deutsche bank chief executive josef ackermann walked free from one of the biggest corporate trials in germany on wednesday after prosecutors agreed to drop charges in return for a multi-million-euro settlement . the regional court in düsseldorf hearing the case announced that the charges against ackermann and five co-defendants had been formally dropped in exchange for an agreement to pay a total of 5.8 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- in financial settlements . the deal marks the end of the long-running mannesmann trial , a landmark case that put corporate ethics and alleged boardroom greed in the spotlight in germany . already on friday , prosecutors had agreed to drop charges against ackermann in exchange for a financial settlement for him alone of 3.2 million euros .
the deutsche bank chief had agreed to pay the money - which amounts to three months ' of his current wages - out of his own pocket . charges were also dropped against the other five co-defendants , likewise in return for cash payments .
no verdict , no criminal record mannesmann 's former chairman , klaus esser , will have to fork out 1.5 million euros , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk 1.0 million euros , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel 60,000 euros and former works council members jürgen ladberg and dietmar droste will pay 30,000 euros and 12,500 euros respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , esser , funk , zwickel , from top left , clockwise under terms of the settlement , the men will not have a criminal record . the men had been accused of breach of fiduciary duty for their role in approving huge bonuses following the takeover of german telecom giant mannesmann in 2000 by british mobile phone giant vodafone .
they were accused of breaking the law by approving 111.5 million marks -lrb- 57 million euros -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives .
esser himself pocketed 16.4 million euros . the six men were originally acquitted in july 2004 .
but at the end of last year , the germany 's supreme court ordered a retrial , which opened just a month ago .
ethical can of worms the mannesmann case has not only put executive pay in germany in the spotlight .
it also raised ethical questions about what had been the successful transformation of mannesmann from an industrial conglomerate into a leading mobile telecommunications group . in the original trial , the court ruled that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . at the time of the mannesmann payouts , ackermann had been a member of the group 's supervisory board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense said the bonuses were a valid way to motivate company brass ackermann and his defense team argued that big payouts to executives , common in the united states and britain , were needed to motivate corporate leaders to take risks . after all , mannesmann had been transformed from a heavy engineering group into a telecommunications giant at the beginning of deregulation of telecommunications and the arrival of mobile telephones . esser argued during his trial that the price of shares in the company had doubled during his tenure . prosecutors contended that the payments were illegal because they were designed to persuade managers , and esser in particular , to drop their resistance to vodafone 's bid after a long takeover battle .
critics saw the bonuses , unprecedentedly high by german standards , as evidence of corporate greed , especially because many mannesmann employees were expected to lose their jobs as a result of the takeover . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

the plant which employs 900 people would then be dismantled and rebuilt elsewhere by 2015 . the final details will be worked out over the next months but fraport has already agreed to recompense celanese with a sum of 650 million euros -lrb- $ 855 million -rrb- .
some 20 million euros will be paid to the chemicals company as early as this year . objections due to security and environmental risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forests will have to be destroyed so the airport can expand ticona had originally objected to fraport 's plans because they feared it would represent a security risk to have jets flying in and taking off at heights of just 70 meters -lrb- 76 yards -rrb- over the chemicals factory . environmental protection groups also oppose the plan because it will require the clearance of over 160 hectares of protected forest , as well as entail increased noise pollution for nearby inhabitants . however , fraport saw ticona 's security objections as a more serious threat to its expansion plans , which are supported by hesse 's regional state premier roland koch and have been floating around for over 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's second-busiest airport frankfurt 's airport authority insists that the construction of a fourth runway is vital to its plans to expand europe 's second-busiest airport after london heathrow and secure thousands of jobs in the region .

the plant which employs 900 people would then be dismantled and rebuilt elsewhere by 2015 . the final details will be worked out over the next months but fraport has already agreed to recompense celanese with a sum of 650 million euros -lrb- $ 855 million -rrb- .
some 20 million euros will be paid to the chemicals company as early as this year . objections due to security and environmental risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forests will have to be destroyed so the airport can expand ticona had originally objected to fraport 's plans because they feared it would represent a security risk to have jets flying in and taking off at heights of just 70 meters -lrb- 76 yards -rrb- over the chemicals factory . environmental protection groups also oppose the plan because it will require the clearance of over 160 hectares of protected forest , as well as entail increased noise pollution for nearby inhabitants . however , fraport saw ticona 's security objections as a more serious threat to its expansion plans , which are supported by hesse 's regional state premier roland koch and have been floating around for over 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's second-busiest airport frankfurt 's airport authority insists that the construction of a fourth runway is vital to its plans to expand europe 's second-busiest airport after london heathrow and secure thousands of jobs in the region .
while air traffic in europe continues to expand massively , frankfurt airport is already operating at the limit of its capacity .
fraport argues that an extra runway could boost capacity by half and the company is also planning to build a third terminal .

a spokesman for celanese declined to comment but insisted the plant would remain in germany . the hesse region 's opposition spd and green parties were critical of the deal , saying that thousands of jobs would be axed as part of the relocation . under the terms of the deal , fraport has agreed to set up an employment company for ticona employees who can not be transferred .
the hesse authorities will also be involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stock exchange in frankfurt " the fact that an employment company is being set up is a clear sign of what 's to come , " said the greens ' chief whip frank kaufmann .

" we are going to recommend suspending the chapters of negotiations which are connected with commercial restrictions on cyprus , which is between four and nine chapters out of 35 , " a commission source said . " turkey has undoubtedly made progress .
but it has still not implemented all obligations it has agreed to , " said commission president jose manuel barroso . a spokesman for the turkish representation to the eu in brussels , caglar cakiralp , said eight " chapters , " or policy areas into which the accession talks are divided , would be suspended . he added that he considered the move too harsh . " it means you suspend nearly the whole process , " he said .

" it is a strong signal when one says there are chapters which can not be opened . " merkel , speaking at a nato summit in riga , said it was essential that turkey implement its pledge not to discriminate against eu states . the german leader opposes turkish eu membership and instead calls for ankara to be given what she terms a " privileged partnership . " the german line is echoed by austria , france and the netherlands . the likely halting of eu-turkey negotiations means that germany , which takes over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2007 , could be handed an unwelcome political hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's tony blair warned the eu on taking too hard a line the eu is , however , deeply divided when it comes to accepting turkey into it ranks . british prime minister tony blair , speaking after meeting turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan at a nato summit in riga , said the bloc should not send a negative signal to turkey .

european heavyweight states like germany , france , spain and italy came under pressure to do more in southern afghanistan , where british-led troops have faced a growing death toll in fighting against taliban insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the chances for success in afghanistan had risen thanks to the summit chancellor angela merkel after the summit stressed that germany 's contribution to the afghanistan mission was highly valued by its nato partners .
she had also once more assured alliance members that germany would come to nato 's aid in emergencies beyond the locations where the bundeswehr is deployed . she added that solidarity demanded it and that it was clear " germany would n't close its eyes to this solidarity . " as an example , she suggested evacuating wounded soldiers from other nato states .
question of credibility nato took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in 2003 .
it currently comprises some 32,000 troops from 37 nations .
isaf has , however , faced increasingly fierce fighting since moving into the volatile south this year , and in september nato 's top commander us general james jones called for 2,500 extra military personnel . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the agreement on afghanistan . " everyone accepts this is nato 's absolutely critical mission , " he said .
" there is complete agreement around the table that nato 's credibility is ... on the line .

" i have been tasked ... to think about and to forward proposals on the possibility of a contact group for afghanistan , " de hoop scheffer added . overall , he said the nato summit was good news for the people of afghanistan , " the bottom line is that , five years after the fall of the taliban , afghanistan is making progress . "
" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself . " taking into account the importance of long-term stability in the western balkans and acknowledging the progress made so far ... we have invited these three countries to join partnership for peace , " said the nato declaration .

they might be invading your playground any day now the bavarian city of nuremberg is planning to open an exclusive playground for senior citizens .
are the elderly - and young people alike - in germany ready for this new chapter in the war between generations ? senior citizens are a highly misunderstood group of germans .
their sole purpose in life is not - despite what many people think - to shut down their young neighbor 's parties by calling the police , to grumble about dog poop in the streets , or throw hysterical fits if their train arrives five minutes behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , the founding mother of gray panthers , is 81 senior citizens are also politically conscious and active people .
last year , a german activist group called gray panthers celebrated its 30th anniversary of fighting for senior rights .
in 1989 , the gray panthers even established a political wing - the grays - a party whose results usually appeared as an invisible condiment on the smallest slice of an election pie-chart marked " others . " but even the grays ' political invisibility seems to be becoming a thing of the past .
in the last municipal elections in berlin , the grays won the unprecedented 3.8 percent of the votes .
german seniors are coming .
with a vengeance . let 's play clever politicians know how to spot trends early .
that is why the bavarian city of nuremberg decided to jump on the bandwagon of senior renaissance and open a senior citizens ' playground , where grandmas and grandpas could get together to bowl , play chess or simply hang out with their peers .
if you 're under 60 : tough luck !
you 'll have to look for friends elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do they have to be that loud ?
" it will be a place where the senior generation can find a refuge from younger people , " said deputy mayor horst förther , who is also in charge of sport activities in the city .
" we agreed that it was a good idea , given our demographic changes . " the project in nuremberg was inspired by research from the finnish university of lapland .
the experiments with what finnish researchers called " three-generational play " showed that senior citizens experienced significant improvements in balance , co-ordination and speed after only three months of " playing . " dangers ahead " i am considering a running track , a path for roller-skating , a soft badminton court and a trampoline , which is easy on the joints , " förther said .
" all activities can be carried out slowly so that the old people are n't pushed beyond their limits . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is munch 's " scream " about modernist angst or a child off a trampoline ?
parents who ever made the fatal mistake of purchasing a trampoline for their children - losing , as a consequence , the peace of their mind and the quiet of their garden - would beg to differ .
a trampoline may be easy on the joints , but it is known to produce an adrenaline rush in children on pair with bungee jumping off the chinese yangtze river tamer known as the three gorges dam .
it turns children into wild , uncontrollable , self-sustainable noise-machines .
it may have the same effect on senior citizens . " retired people need a space to be themselves without someone coming along and spilling ice-cream on their trousers or breakdancing , " said social worker andrea weber , who specializes in the lifestyle of the elderly . a cultural shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more playground sharing !
aside from the question whether ice-cream eating breakdancers have nothing better to do than throw scoops of chocolate-vanilla gelato at the local senior population , the german war of generations may take a turn for the bizarre . if , in early afternoon hours , playgrounds start filling with bouncing and screaming grandpas , those very same young people who had their party shut down the night before by their intolerant neighbors , may have to resort to calling the police to whine about the jumping geriatrics of germany ruining their alternative , hung-over , 4-pm breakfast . things could get really interesting . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

they might be invading your playground any day now the bavarian city of nuremberg is planning to open an exclusive playground for senior citizens .
are the elderly - and young people alike - in germany ready for this new chapter in the war between generations ? senior citizens are a highly misunderstood group of germans .
their sole purpose in life is not - despite what many people think - to shut down their young neighbor 's parties by calling the police , to grumble about dog poop in the streets , or throw hysterical fits if their train arrives five minutes behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , the founding mother of gray panthers , is 81 senior citizens are also politically conscious and active people .
last year , a german activist group called gray panthers celebrated its 30th anniversary of fighting for senior rights .
in 1989 , the gray panthers even established a political wing - the grays - a party whose results usually appeared as an invisible condiment on the smallest slice of an election pie-chart marked " others . " but even the grays ' political invisibility seems to be becoming a thing of the past .
in the last municipal elections in berlin , the grays won the unprecedented 3.8 percent of the votes .
german seniors are coming .
with a vengeance . let 's play clever politicians know how to spot trends early .
that is why the bavarian city of nuremberg decided to jump on the bandwagon of senior renaissance and open a senior citizens ' playground , where grandmas and grandpas could get together to bowl , play chess or simply hang out with their peers .
if you 're under 60 : tough luck !
you 'll have to look for friends elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do they have to be that loud ?
" it will be a place where the senior generation can find a refuge from younger people , " said deputy mayor horst förther , who is also in charge of sport activities in the city .
" we agreed that it was a good idea , given our demographic changes . " the project in nuremberg was inspired by research from the finnish university of lapland .
the experiments with what finnish researchers called " three-generational play " showed that senior citizens experienced significant improvements in balance , co-ordination and speed after only three months of " playing . " dangers ahead " i am considering a running track , a path for roller-skating , a soft badminton court and a trampoline , which is easy on the joints , " förther said .
" all activities can be carried out slowly so that the old people are n't pushed beyond their limits . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is munch 's " scream " about modernist angst or a child off a trampoline ?
parents who ever made the fatal mistake of purchasing a trampoline for their children - losing , as a consequence , the peace of their mind and the quiet of their garden - would beg to differ .
a trampoline may be easy on the joints , but it is known to produce an adrenaline rush in children on pair with bungee jumping off the chinese yangtze river tamer known as the three gorges dam .
it turns children into wild , uncontrollable , self-sustainable noise-machines .
it may have the same effect on senior citizens . " retired people need a space to be themselves without someone coming along and spilling ice-cream on their trousers or breakdancing , " said social worker andrea weber , who specializes in the lifestyle of the elderly . a cultural shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more playground sharing !
aside from the question whether ice-cream eating breakdancers have nothing better to do than throw scoops of chocolate-vanilla gelato at the local senior population , the german war of generations may take a turn for the bizarre . if , in early afternoon hours , playgrounds start filling with bouncing and screaming grandpas , those very same young people who had their party shut down the night before by their intolerant neighbors , may have to resort to calling the police to whine about the jumping geriatrics of germany ruining their alternative , hung-over , 4-pm breakfast . things could get really interesting . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

a new eu report sheds some light germany and 10 other states knew about secret cia prisons in europe , and obstructed investigations into the case , the european parliament said in a report . there were 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe , a european parliament committee said in a draft report on tuesday . " many governments cooperated passively or actively -lrb- with the cia -rrb- , " the committee 's rapporteur claudio fava said .
" they knew . " the draft , which was based on classified documents and secret informants , noted at least at least 1,245 suspicious flights through european air space or stopovers at european airports that took place at the request of the cia . the report was the result of an investigation by a special committee of the european parliament into " extraordinary rendition " - the us practice of transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for questioning . extraordinary rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report took the eu 's javier solana to task human rights groups accuse the united states of having used extraordinary rendition in order to interrogate suspected terrorists under methods not allowed in the us itself , including torture . the german government has dismissed the report , which came out tuesday .
the eu committee also claimed austria , great britain , italy , poland , sweden , ireland , spain , portugal , greece and cyprus knew about the prisons . the report urged officials in the individual eu countries to start their own investigations as to whether their governments have broken european human rights accords with their use of extraordinary rendition . it also criticizes eu foreign policy chief javier solana and anti-terror coordinator gijs de vries , accusing them of having given incomplete statements to the investigating committee . failure to cooperate the report was especially critical of solana , expressing its " profound preoccupation " with the " omissions " and " denials " when the eu 's top diplomat appeared before the committee , in may . germany and spain were the only countries fava said adequately cooperated with eu committee 's investigation .
fava offered little in the way of conclusions , simply inviting the eu authorities to " accept their responsibilities " to deal with the offending member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri wants an apology from the cia meanwhile , a us appeals court in the state of virginia has agreed to hear the case of german-lebanese citizen khaled el-masri against ex-cia chief george tenet .
el-masri accused the cia of taking prison in afghanistan , where he was allegedly beaten , in a case of mistaken identity . el-masri is seeking damages of at least $ 75,000 -lrb- 57,142 euros -rrb- on allegations of unlawful capture , imprisonment , torture and other human rights violations .
a decision is expected next week , a spokesman for the richmond court said . in may , a lower us court had refused to hear the case that sparked a parliamentary investigation in germany , saying it would uncover state secrets and thus endanger the public . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators examine possibility of secret us prison in germany german federal prosecutors announced saturday that they are looking into claims of human rights violations stemming from the alleged detention of terror suspects at secret us prisons in germany .

the deutsche bank chief had agreed to pay the money - which amounts to three months ' of his current wages - out of his own pocket . charges were also dropped against the other five co-defendants , likewise in return for cash payments .
no verdict , no criminal record mannesmann 's former chairman , klaus esser , will have to fork out 1.5 million euros , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk 1.0 million euros , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel 60,000 euros and former works council members jürgen ladberg and dietmar droste will pay 30,000 euros and 12,500 euros respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , esser , funk , zwickel , from top left , clockwise under terms of the settlement , the men will not have a criminal record . the men had been accused of breach of fiduciary duty for their role in approving huge bonuses following the takeover of german telecom giant mannesmann in 2000 by british mobile phone giant vodafone .
they were accused of breaking the law by approving 111.5 million marks -lrb- 57 million euros -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives .
esser himself pocketed 16.4 million euros . the six men were originally acquitted in july 2004 .
but at the end of last year , the germany 's supreme court ordered a retrial , which opened just a month ago .
ethical can of worms the mannesmann case has not only put executive pay in germany in the spotlight .
it also raised ethical questions about what had been the successful transformation of mannesmann from an industrial conglomerate into a leading mobile telecommunications group . in the original trial , the court ruled that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . at the time of the mannesmann payouts , ackermann had been a member of the group 's supervisory board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense said the bonuses were a valid way to motivate company brass ackermann and his defense team argued that big payouts to executives , common in the united states and britain , were needed to motivate corporate leaders to take risks . after all , mannesmann had been transformed from a heavy engineering group into a telecommunications giant at the beginning of deregulation of telecommunications and the arrival of mobile telephones . esser argued during his trial that the price of shares in the company had doubled during his tenure . prosecutors contended that the payments were illegal because they were designed to persuade managers , and esser in particular , to drop their resistance to vodafone 's bid after a long takeover battle .
critics saw the bonuses , unprecedentedly high by german standards , as evidence of corporate greed , especially because many mannesmann employees were expected to lose their jobs as a result of the takeover . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 29.11.2006 cooking course takes a bite out of obesity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : curried sausage is a fast food staple in germany western populations are getting fatter , due to too little exercise and too much fast food .
socially disadvantaged families are particularly prone to such diets .
but a cooking course in hamburg hopes to change that . a cooking project in the hamburg neighborhood jensfeld , home to a large number of socially underprivileged families , is helping women rethink their families ' diets and start preparing more home-cooked meals . once a week for three hours , the participants learn how to whip up delicious healthy meals with little effort and a small budget .
home economics teacher sabine kuchenbecker said a lot of people do n't know that fast food is n't only unhealthy , it 's also expensive . she said a lot of young women who never learned how to cook automatically think it 's cheaper to buy ready-to-serve meals . " but it 's significantly less expensive to cook yourself , especially if you shop a bit price-consciously , " kuchenbecker said .
" it 's our job to relay these skills to these women . " battling the bulge with healthy cooking every fifth german is too fat , according to the world health organization .
this trend is particularly prominent among underprivileged families , which tend to eat fast food or ready-to-serve meals .
the results are serious health problems , such as diabetes at a young age , stiffening of the joints or even cardiovascular diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast food can lead to serious health problems for children the charity hamburger tafel or hamburg table is coordinating the project , which costs five euros -lrb- $ 6.60 -rrb- for the five-week course . for the participants , healthy is n't always easy to get used to , though .
the 33-year-old single mother katja does n't like mustard and turns her nose up as she takes a sniff of walnut oil to make homemade salad dressing . " well , it 's okay , but i think it 's a matter of taste , " katja said , who usually buys finished products , such as french dressing , which has lots of preservatives and is more fattening than homemade dressing . women like katja are common in neighborhoods like this .
but she wants to change her eating habits , she said . " i want to learn something about cooking and nutrition because it 's important for my daughter , " katja said .
her daughter is three years old and already slightly chubby .
katja 's unhealthy diet over the past years is evident in her figure , too . " i usually go to a snack bar or get pizza , " katja said .
but here , she has learned that homemade pizza , for example , only costs about a third of frozen pizza . cooking can spice up life instructor kuchenbecker said she wants to motivate these women to try out new things , such as using a different spice or tasting another type of salad .
participant gaby is taking the course for the second time and has learned a lot .
the 43-year-old mother of nine still has four children living at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetables are a healthy and affordable alternative to fast food " my kitchen always just had salt , pepper and paprika as spices , " gaby said .
" i did n't dare to try anything else .
now , when i make a soup , i put in oregano and thyme and it really tastes better to me . " even katja has tried her first homemade dressing with mustard and walnut oil , and it 's was n't bad , she said . " it tastes good now that i 've tried it , " katja said .
" i 'm going to make my own dressing from now on . " cooking can boost self-confidence but the hamburg course is about more than just affordable meals , kuchenbecker said .
it 's also about motivation .
a lot of these women have never gotten any confirmation in their lives .
many did poorly in school , for example . " when you simply say to them , ' wow , you did that well ' or ' you did a super job seasoning that , ' they really beam at you , as they 've maybe never heard that before in their lives , " kuchenbecker said . so that the women do n't forget what they 've learned , every participant gets a goodie bag at the end of the course .

the scheme , established last year and ending in 2007 , aims to reduce carbon emissions by providing a market-based trading system .
it is based on limiting the total amount of co2 emissions , but can offer control over reductions flexibly and at a low-cost . it is designed to put caps on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by heavily polluting factories across europe .
but in 2006 , the governments of some eu countries gave away free carbon pollution permits that exceeded the amount of pollution that was released - which the european environment commission has decided to put a stop to . germany was the most generous , with france and poland also handing out carbon credits faster than pollution can be emitted .
only a few countries - such as britain and ireland - distributed allowances that fairly matched the needs of big companies . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas criticized several european countries , including germany , greece , ireland , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia and sweden , for giving away too many pollution allowances that they hold in reserve for building new factories .

singer said that the permits to pollute , based on an earlier draft by the german government , were " quite horrible .

" we are going to recommend suspending the chapters of negotiations which are connected with commercial restrictions on cyprus , which is between four and nine chapters out of 35 , " a commission source said . " turkey has undoubtedly made progress .
but it has still not implemented all obligations it has agreed to , " said commission president jose manuel barroso . a spokesman for the turkish representation to the eu in brussels , caglar cakiralp , said eight " chapters , " or policy areas into which the accession talks are divided , would be suspended . he added that he considered the move too harsh .

" i view it as right , " she told reporters .
" it is a strong signal when one says there are chapters which can not be opened . " merkel , speaking at a nato summit in riga , said it was essential that turkey implement its pledge not to discriminate against eu states . the german leader opposes turkish eu membership and instead calls for ankara to be given what she terms a " privileged partnership . " the german line is echoed by austria , france and the netherlands . the likely halting of eu-turkey negotiations means that germany , which takes over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2007 , could be handed an unwelcome political hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's tony blair warned the eu on taking too hard a line the eu is , however , deeply divided when it comes to accepting turkey into it ranks . british prime minister tony blair , speaking after meeting turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan at a nato summit in riga , said the bloc should not send a negative signal to turkey . " we have got to make sure we allow turkey 's accession to proceed , " blair said .
" just at the moment to send an adverse signal to turkey i think would be a serious mistake for europe long-term . " long-term threats eu foreign ministers are due to decide on the matter , based on the commission 's recommendations , when they meet on dec .
11 . the policy sectors to be frozen involve the free movement of goods , capital and services , as well as customs , trade , transport , agriculture and fisheries , the sources said .
the commission would recommend that negotiations proceed on the other chapters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement chief olli rehn said turkey could still avoid the suspension of talks so far , turkey has provisionally concluded talks on one chapter - science and research . for months the eu has been threatening full or partial suspension of membership talks with turkey over its refusal to open its ports to cyprus . stuck in a stalemate ankara refuses to do that until the 25-nation bloc keeps its 2004 promise to ease economic sanctions imposed on the island 's breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , recognized only by ankara . finland , which is a supporter of turkey 's eu membership , has been trying to resolve the stalemate since september with a proposal that included turkey opening its ports and the eu trading directly with the self-proclaimed trnc . but helsinki threw in the towel on monday , saying there was no hope of an agreement during its eu presidency , which concludes on dec .

" we are going to recommend suspending the chapters of negotiations which are connected with commercial restrictions on cyprus , which is between four and nine chapters out of 35 , " a commission source said . " turkey has undoubtedly made progress .
but it has still not implemented all obligations it has agreed to , " said commission president jose manuel barroso . a spokesman for the turkish representation to the eu in brussels , caglar cakiralp , said eight " chapters , " or policy areas into which the accession talks are divided , would be suspended . he added that he considered the move too harsh . " it means you suspend nearly the whole process , " he said .
" it 's too much . " commission " sending a signal " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ankara alone recognizes the turkish republic of northern cyprus the recommendation came after talks brokered by the eu 's finnish presidency on the cyprus trade issue failed on monday . " the commission wants to send a signal that turkey must meet its obligations , " a senior eu official told reuters news service . the commission 's move won immediate backing from german chancellor angela merkel . " i view it as right , " she told reporters .
" it is a strong signal when one says there are chapters which can not be opened . " merkel , speaking at a nato summit in riga , said it was essential that turkey implement its pledge not to discriminate against eu states . the german leader opposes turkish eu membership and instead calls for ankara to be given what she terms a " privileged partnership . " the german line is echoed by austria , france and the netherlands . the likely halting of eu-turkey negotiations means that germany , which takes over the eu presidency on january 1 , 2007 , could be handed an unwelcome political hot potato . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's tony blair warned the eu on taking too hard a line the eu is , however , deeply divided when it comes to accepting turkey into it ranks . british prime minister tony blair , speaking after meeting turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan at a nato summit in riga , said the bloc should not send a negative signal to turkey . " we have got to make sure we allow turkey 's accession to proceed , " blair said .
" just at the moment to send an adverse signal to turkey i think would be a serious mistake for europe long-term . " long-term threats eu foreign ministers are due to decide on the matter , based on the commission 's recommendations , when they meet on dec .
11 . the policy sectors to be frozen involve the free movement of goods , capital and services , as well as customs , trade , transport , agriculture and fisheries , the sources said .
the commission would recommend that negotiations proceed on the other chapters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement chief olli rehn said turkey could still avoid the suspension of talks so far , turkey has provisionally concluded talks on one chapter - science and research . for months the eu has been threatening full or partial suspension of membership talks with turkey over its refusal to open its ports to cyprus . stuck in a stalemate ankara refuses to do that until the 25-nation bloc keeps its 2004 promise to ease economic sanctions imposed on the island 's breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus -lrb- trnc -rrb- , recognized only by ankara . finland , which is a supporter of turkey 's eu membership , has been trying to resolve the stalemate since september with a proposal that included turkey opening its ports and the eu trading directly with the self-proclaimed trnc . but helsinki threw in the towel on monday , saying there was no hope of an agreement during its eu presidency , which concludes on dec .

only pharmacies run by certified pharmacy owners may sell medicinal drugs , but the meds monopoly has been getting a run for its money of late . got an excruciating headache ?
need an aspirin lickety-split ?
well , if you 're in germany and it 's a sunday , forget about grabbing a bottle of over-the-counter painkillers at the grocery store . not only are german grocery stores not open sundays , you wo n't find aspirin there anyway .
unless you have friends or neighbors with aspirin on hand , you 'll just have to wrestle with the hellish mindgrip unless you 're willing to shlep around town to find the emergency pharmacy on duty . limited access , high prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head ready to explode ?
aspirin is expensive and hard to buy in germany for decades , germany 's restrictive laws have limited the selling of medications only to pharmacies , which must be personally run by registered pharmacy owners . though european countries have been deregulating everything from telecommunications to postal services and railways , german lawmakers have been reluctant to tamper with the pill market , resulting in protection against competition among pharmacies and continued high prices . as of 2004 , however , pharmacists are now allowed to own not just one , but up to three of their own stores . risky business pharmacists generally support limited access to medication , saying that it ensures public safety . " even minor painkillers contain risks and should only be sold by pharmacists who provide information on them and who sell them only in limited amounts , " said ursula sellerberg , a spokeswoman for the federation of german pharmacists ' associations -lrb- abda -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the sugar to make the medicine go down ?
still , " liberalization of who sells medication would mean greater competition and pharmacies would be forced to lower prices , " said kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . vogel said german consumer protection agencies , however , are advocating that pharmacies should still be required to provide information about medication risk . sellerberg , for her part , pointed out that stomach problems from mere aspirin can occur when taken in high doses . " we 're encouraging pharmacists to advise even for ' lighter ' medications , " she added . gaining ground chain drug stores where consumers can buy inexpensive over-the-counter medication or prescription drugs provided by a trained pharmacist have been non-existent in germany .
there 's no riteaid , no cvs , no duane read - to name some of the us 's largest retailers . that has begun to change over the past few months .
in july , former software engineer ralf däinghaus opened a docmorris - europe 's largest mail-order medication firm based in the netherlands - pharmacy in saarbrücken .
thus ensued a debate over whether germany should permit retail drug chains . on the one hand , german pharmacists say docmorris was violating german law , which forbids corporations from owning pharmacies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris store in saarbrücken in august on the other hand , saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the dutch docmorris to open shop in saarbrücken , said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law . " penny-pinchers some customers in saarbrücken were delighted , saying they could save up to 30 percent on prescription and over-the counter drugs at docmorris .
and they 're not cheap at traditional pharmacies : there a package of 20 brand-name aspirin tablets costs just under five euros -lrb- around $ 6.50 -rrb- , though a generic version of 30 tablets costs around half that . ralph däinghaus was proud to announce double the number of sales in the first month of opening the saarbrücken store , as compared to sales by the former pharmacy store he took over there . he " expected success , " he told germany 's tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- daily , because medication costs in germany are " scandalous " compared to france and belgium , where the same drugs cost half the price , taz wrote . german pharmacists were less than thrilled , however , and began worrying that their livelihoods were at stake and patients at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a " for apotheke or " pharmacy " däinghaus has also been in and out of court since july , with three saarbrücken pharmacists and two german pharmacy associations - who contested docmorris - eventually chalking up a victory when the saarland district court ordered the docmorris store in germany to be closed . " the decision was right based on german law , " said vogel , " but it is very likely that docmorris will go all the way to the european court of justice with countersuits and that the ban will be reversed and drug prices will eventually change in germany . " reform headaches in berlin , lawmakers plan to install a price cap on prescription drugs ; pharmacies could lower prices , but not raise them .
and , since only pharmacies are permitted to supply hospitals with drugs , politicians believe cheaper medication could also mean drastic savings in germany 's flailing public health care system . " but pharmacy costs make up only 2.7 percent of all the expenses of the public health care system , " said abda 's sellerberg .
" that 's only half of what the public insurance schemes need for their administrative tasks . " traditional pharmacists have been up-in-arms .
throughout november , thousands of them have staged protests across germany against health care reforms which they say threaten their existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional pharmacy in germany reform plans include a clause in which pharmacists would be expected to negotiate rebates between insurance groups and pharmaceutical manufacturers .
should they fail , pharmacists would have to contribute 500 millions euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- from their own pockets to the government . abda maintains this is unfair since costs for insurance companies have risen not because pharmacists maintain high prices , but because 80 percent of what public health insurers pay for patients ' medications goes to pharmaceutical manufacturers and taxes . kai vogel believes it 's only a matter of time until germany changes its ways and starts allowing more competition .
for now , he suggests that when shopping in pharmacies , consumers should request drug prices and ask for less expensive generic varieties . they should also make sure they do n't get a headache on sunday . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de internet pharmacies not bringing expected savings although ordering prescriptions over the internet has been made legal in germany as part of the reform measures instituted to help the burdened public health system , the expected savings have n't materialized .

the scheme , established last year and ending in 2007 , aims to reduce carbon emissions by providing a market-based trading system .
it is based on limiting the total amount of co2 emissions , but can offer control over reductions flexibly and at a low-cost . it is designed to put caps on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by heavily polluting factories across europe .
but in 2006 , the governments of some eu countries gave away free carbon pollution permits that exceeded the amount of pollution that was released - which the european environment commission has decided to put a stop to . germany was the most generous , with france and poland also handing out carbon credits faster than pollution can be emitted .
only a few countries - such as britain and ireland - distributed allowances that fairly matched the needs of big companies . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas criticized several european countries , including germany , greece , ireland , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia and sweden , for giving away too many pollution allowances that they hold in reserve for building new factories .

singer said that the permits to pollute , based on an earlier draft by the german government , were " quite horrible . " for a country that wants to lead the world in climate change and renewable energy , its allowances to grow its coal base in the power sector are a scandalous proposal to the commission , " he said . the german coal industry has come out against the commissions stance , arguing that it will hurt the utilities sector . singer responded by saying that if the coal industry is complaining about the decision , then " i know that dimas has done the right thing .

socially disadvantaged families are particularly prone to such diets .
but a cooking course in hamburg hopes to change that . a cooking project in the hamburg neighborhood jensfeld , home to a large number of socially underprivileged families , is helping women rethink their families ' diets and start preparing more home-cooked meals . once a week for three hours , the participants learn how to whip up delicious healthy meals with little effort and a small budget .
home economics teacher sabine kuchenbecker said a lot of people do n't know that fast food is n't only unhealthy , it 's also expensive . she said a lot of young women who never learned how to cook automatically think it 's cheaper to buy ready-to-serve meals . " but it 's significantly less expensive to cook yourself , especially if you shop a bit price-consciously , " kuchenbecker said .
" it 's our job to relay these skills to these women . " battling the bulge with healthy cooking every fifth german is too fat , according to the world health organization .
this trend is particularly prominent among underprivileged families , which tend to eat fast food or ready-to-serve meals .
the results are serious health problems , such as diabetes at a young age , stiffening of the joints or even cardiovascular diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast food can lead to serious health problems for children the charity hamburger tafel or hamburg table is coordinating the project , which costs five euros -lrb- $ 6.60 -rrb- for the five-week course . for the participants , healthy is n't always easy to get used to , though .
the 33-year-old single mother katja does n't like mustard and turns her nose up as she takes a sniff of walnut oil to make homemade salad dressing . " well , it 's okay , but i think it 's a matter of taste , " katja said , who usually buys finished products , such as french dressing , which has lots of preservatives and is more fattening than homemade dressing . women like katja are common in neighborhoods like this .
but she wants to change her eating habits , she said . " i want to learn something about cooking and nutrition because it 's important for my daughter , " katja said .
her daughter is three years old and already slightly chubby .
katja 's unhealthy diet over the past years is evident in her figure , too . " i usually go to a snack bar or get pizza , " katja said .
but here , she has learned that homemade pizza , for example , only costs about a third of frozen pizza . cooking can spice up life instructor kuchenbecker said she wants to motivate these women to try out new things , such as using a different spice or tasting another type of salad .
participant gaby is taking the course for the second time and has learned a lot .
the 43-year-old mother of nine still has four children living at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetables are a healthy and affordable alternative to fast food " my kitchen always just had salt , pepper and paprika as spices , " gaby said .
" i did n't dare to try anything else .
now , when i make a soup , i put in oregano and thyme and it really tastes better to me . " even katja has tried her first homemade dressing with mustard and walnut oil , and it 's was n't bad , she said . " it tastes good now that i 've tried it , " katja said .
" i 'm going to make my own dressing from now on . " cooking can boost self-confidence but the hamburg course is about more than just affordable meals , kuchenbecker said .
it 's also about motivation .
a lot of these women have never gotten any confirmation in their lives .
many did poorly in school , for example . " when you simply say to them , ' wow , you did that well ' or ' you did a super job seasoning that , ' they really beam at you , as they 've maybe never heard that before in their lives , " kuchenbecker said . so that the women do n't forget what they 've learned , every participant gets a goodie bag at the end of the course .

only pharmacies run by certified pharmacy owners may sell medicinal drugs , but the meds monopoly has been getting a run for its money of late . got an excruciating headache ?
need an aspirin lickety-split ?
well , if you 're in germany and it 's a sunday , forget about grabbing a bottle of over-the-counter painkillers at the grocery store . not only are german grocery stores not open sundays , you wo n't find aspirin there anyway .
unless you have friends or neighbors with aspirin on hand , you 'll just have to wrestle with the hellish mindgrip unless you 're willing to shlep around town to find the emergency pharmacy on duty . limited access , high prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head ready to explode ?
aspirin is expensive and hard to buy in germany for decades , germany 's restrictive laws have limited the selling of medications only to pharmacies , which must be personally run by registered pharmacy owners . though european countries have been deregulating everything from telecommunications to postal services and railways , german lawmakers have been reluctant to tamper with the pill market , resulting in protection against competition among pharmacies and continued high prices . as of 2004 , however , pharmacists are now allowed to own not just one , but up to three of their own stores . risky business pharmacists generally support limited access to medication , saying that it ensures public safety . " even minor painkillers contain risks and should only be sold by pharmacists who provide information on them and who sell them only in limited amounts , " said ursula sellerberg , a spokeswoman for the federation of german pharmacists ' associations -lrb- abda -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the sugar to make the medicine go down ?
still , " liberalization of who sells medication would mean greater competition and pharmacies would be forced to lower prices , " said kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . vogel said german consumer protection agencies , however , are advocating that pharmacies should still be required to provide information about medication risk . sellerberg , for her part , pointed out that stomach problems from mere aspirin can occur when taken in high doses . " we 're encouraging pharmacists to advise even for ' lighter ' medications , " she added . gaining ground chain drug stores where consumers can buy inexpensive over-the-counter medication or prescription drugs provided by a trained pharmacist have been non-existent in germany .
there 's no riteaid , no cvs , no duane read - to name some of the us 's largest retailers . that has begun to change over the past few months .
in july , former software engineer ralf däinghaus opened a docmorris - europe 's largest mail-order medication firm based in the netherlands - pharmacy in saarbrücken .

the scheme , established last year and ending in 2007 , aims to reduce carbon emissions by providing a market-based trading system .
it is based on limiting the total amount of co2 emissions , but can offer control over reductions flexibly and at a low-cost . it is designed to put caps on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by heavily polluting factories across europe .
but in 2006 , the governments of some eu countries gave away free carbon pollution permits that exceeded the amount of pollution that was released - which the european environment commission has decided to put a stop to . germany was the most generous , with france and poland also handing out carbon credits faster than pollution can be emitted .
only a few countries - such as britain and ireland - distributed allowances that fairly matched the needs of big companies . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas criticized several european countries , including germany , greece , ireland , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia and sweden , for giving away too many pollution allowances that they hold in reserve for building new factories . " today 's decision sends a strong signal that europe is fully committed to achieving the kyoto target and making the eu ets a success , " dimas said in a statement . drastic reductions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the carbon trading scheme is working towards meeting kyoto targets stephan singer , the head of the european climate and energy policy unit in brussels for the wwf , was pleased that the allowances for germany to pollute have been reduced " quite drastically . " " germany has proposed that once it gets an allocation for a coal fire station , the allocation would be valid for the next 14 years at least - which the commission objected to , " singer said .
" this is particularly good , considering that germany is the largest oecd country in the european union . " singer said the wwf would like to see the commission " keep persistent and as straight forward , to help europe to deliver on its kyoto targets . " germany under fire over carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coal industry will probably be affected by the commissions ruling germany was the most generous with the emission credit surpluses , producing 21.4 million tons , or 4.3 percent less in emissions than its average annual cap allowance , according to a report in the new york times . france , germany , italy , poland , spain and uk make up for 73 percent of overall eu emissions .
singer said that the permits to pollute , based on an earlier draft by the german government , were " quite horrible . " for a country that wants to lead the world in climate change and renewable energy , its allowances to grow its coal base in the power sector are a scandalous proposal to the commission , " he said . the german coal industry has come out against the commissions stance , arguing that it will hurt the utilities sector . singer responded by saying that if the coal industry is complaining about the decision , then " i know that dimas has done the right thing . " the wwf wants to see the commission review allowing countries or coal-fired power stations to buy emissions , like through auctioning . " auctioning of pollution permits would represent the ' polluter pays principle ' and the money then could be re-invested into climate protection measures , " he said . rachel ryan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister presses climate change action in wake of dire report on the heels of a major study that says world leaders must act urgently to avert a looming environmental catastrophe , germany 's environment minister has called on the country to invest heavily in green technology .

european heavyweight states like germany , france , spain and italy came under pressure to do more in southern afghanistan , where british-led troops have faced a growing death toll in fighting against taliban insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the chances for success in afghanistan had risen thanks to the summit chancellor angela merkel after the summit stressed that germany 's contribution to the afghanistan mission was highly valued by its nato partners .
she had also once more assured alliance members that germany would come to nato 's aid in emergencies beyond the locations where the bundeswehr is deployed . she added that solidarity demanded it and that it was clear " germany would n't close its eyes to this solidarity . " as an example , she suggested evacuating wounded soldiers from other nato states .
question of credibility nato took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in 2003 .
it currently comprises some 32,000 troops from 37 nations .
isaf has , however , faced increasingly fierce fighting since moving into the volatile south this year , and in september nato 's top commander us general james jones called for 2,500 extra military personnel . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the agreement on afghanistan . " everyone accepts this is nato 's absolutely critical mission , " he said .
" there is complete agreement around the table that nato 's credibility is ... on the line . " but he also admitted that shortfalls remained , with military chiefs saying that so far 85-90 percent of requirements were in place . " we have made significant progress but we still need to make those last remaining steps , " blair said . rapid reaction force nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer highlighted an agreement to deploy forces to help out in emergencies .
" in an emergency ... they will support each other , " he said .
" that is the most fundamental demonstration of nato 's solidarity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer the nato secretary general also confirmed that alliance leaders had supported french president jacques chirac 's proposal to establish an afghan " contact group . "
this could be along the lines of such a group set up for the balkans in the 1990s , comprising the united states , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , to coordinate diplomatic and other action to resolve the conflict . " i have been tasked ... to think about and to forward proposals on the possibility of a contact group for afghanistan , " de hoop scheffer added . overall , he said the nato summit was good news for the people of afghanistan , " the bottom line is that , five years after the fall of the taliban , afghanistan is making progress . "
" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself . " taking into account the importance of long-term stability in the western balkans and acknowledging the progress made so far ... we have invited these three countries to join partnership for peace , " said the nato declaration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was high for the summit and riga 's old town was almost deserted chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte criticized the invitation to the three states , her spokesman said after the summit . " the prosecutor regrets this decision because it looks like a reward for the lack of cooperation ... with the office of the prosecutor , " the spokesman , anton nikiforov , told reporters . nato leaders also decided to invite new countries to join the alliance without naming any country best placed to become a member . " at our next summit in 2008 , the alliance intends to extend further invitations to those countries who meet nato 's performance-based standards and are able to contribute to euro-atlantic security and stability , " they said . also in riga , the nato chiefs declared " fully operational " the alliance 's flagship 25,000-strong nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- .
the force , to be staffed by nato countries on a six-month rotating basis , will stand ready to be deployed within five days for combat missions , evacuations or disaster relief operations lasting for up to a month . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " in afghanistan , damage limitation is the only realistic option " nato 's mission in afghanistan has n't been a failure , but it still could be , cambridge university political scientist christopher hill told dw-world.de. -lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

only pharmacies run by certified pharmacy owners may sell medicinal drugs , but the meds monopoly has been getting a run for its money of late . got an excruciating headache ?
need an aspirin lickety-split ?
well , if you 're in germany and it 's a sunday , forget about grabbing a bottle of over-the-counter painkillers at the grocery store . not only are german grocery stores not open sundays , you wo n't find aspirin there anyway .
unless you have friends or neighbors with aspirin on hand , you 'll just have to wrestle with the hellish mindgrip unless you 're willing to shlep around town to find the emergency pharmacy on duty . limited access , high prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head ready to explode ?
aspirin is expensive and hard to buy in germany for decades , germany 's restrictive laws have limited the selling of medications only to pharmacies , which must be personally run by registered pharmacy owners . though european countries have been deregulating everything from telecommunications to postal services and railways , german lawmakers have been reluctant to tamper with the pill market , resulting in protection against competition among pharmacies and continued high prices . as of 2004 , however , pharmacists are now allowed to own not just one , but up to three of their own stores . risky business pharmacists generally support limited access to medication , saying that it ensures public safety . " even minor painkillers contain risks and should only be sold by pharmacists who provide information on them and who sell them only in limited amounts , " said ursula sellerberg , a spokeswoman for the federation of german pharmacists ' associations -lrb- abda -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the sugar to make the medicine go down ?
still , " liberalization of who sells medication would mean greater competition and pharmacies would be forced to lower prices , " said kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . vogel said german consumer protection agencies , however , are advocating that pharmacies should still be required to provide information about medication risk . sellerberg , for her part , pointed out that stomach problems from mere aspirin can occur when taken in high doses . " we 're encouraging pharmacists to advise even for ' lighter ' medications , " she added . gaining ground chain drug stores where consumers can buy inexpensive over-the-counter medication or prescription drugs provided by a trained pharmacist have been non-existent in germany .
there 's no riteaid , no cvs , no duane read - to name some of the us 's largest retailers . that has begun to change over the past few months .
in july , former software engineer ralf däinghaus opened a docmorris - europe 's largest mail-order medication firm based in the netherlands - pharmacy in saarbrücken .
thus ensued a debate over whether germany should permit retail drug chains . on the one hand , german pharmacists say docmorris was violating german law , which forbids corporations from owning pharmacies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris store in saarbrücken in august on the other hand , saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the dutch docmorris to open shop in saarbrücken , said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law .

some 20 million euros will be paid to the chemicals company as early as this year . objections due to security and environmental risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forests will have to be destroyed so the airport can expand ticona had originally objected to fraport 's plans because they feared it would represent a security risk to have jets flying in and taking off at heights of just 70 meters -lrb- 76 yards -rrb- over the chemicals factory . environmental protection groups also oppose the plan because it will require the clearance of over 160 hectares of protected forest , as well as entail increased noise pollution for nearby inhabitants . however , fraport saw ticona 's security objections as a more serious threat to its expansion plans , which are supported by hesse 's regional state premier roland koch and have been floating around for over 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's second-busiest airport frankfurt 's airport authority insists that the construction of a fourth runway is vital to its plans to expand europe 's second-busiest airport after london heathrow and secure thousands of jobs in the region .
while air traffic in europe continues to expand massively , frankfurt airport is already operating at the limit of its capacity .
fraport argues that an extra runway could boost capacity by half and the company is also planning to build a third terminal .
it hopes that the new runway will be operational by 2010 . the total investment required for the group 's expansion plans is thought to be about 3.2 billion euros . relocation of ticona plant means loss of jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fraport wants to avoid scenes such as these the frankfurter rundschau daily reported that the ticona plant would be relocated to a nearby suburb of frankfurt , where celanese 's parent company hoechst was originally located .
a spokesman for celanese declined to comment but insisted the plant would remain in germany . the hesse region 's opposition spd and green parties were critical of the deal , saying that thousands of jobs would be axed as part of the relocation . under the terms of the deal , fraport has agreed to set up an employment company for ticona employees who can not be transferred .
the hesse authorities will also be involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stock exchange in frankfurt " the fact that an employment company is being set up is a clear sign of what 's to come , " said the greens ' chief whip frank kaufmann .
he said that it made no economic sense to expand an airport in such a densely-populated area . however , fraport chairman william bender welcomed the deal in the name of common sense . " time is money , " he said .
" and every day that global air traffic flies past us is a lost day for our company and our employees , as well as for the region and the people who live here . " although investors are in favor of the expansion plans , they appeared concerned by the costs .

only pharmacies run by certified pharmacy owners may sell medicinal drugs , but the meds monopoly has been getting a run for its money of late . got an excruciating headache ?
need an aspirin lickety-split ?
well , if you 're in germany and it 's a sunday , forget about grabbing a bottle of over-the-counter painkillers at the grocery store . not only are german grocery stores not open sundays , you wo n't find aspirin there anyway .
unless you have friends or neighbors with aspirin on hand , you 'll just have to wrestle with the hellish mindgrip unless you 're willing to shlep around town to find the emergency pharmacy on duty . limited access , high prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head ready to explode ?
aspirin is expensive and hard to buy in germany for decades , germany 's restrictive laws have limited the selling of medications only to pharmacies , which must be personally run by registered pharmacy owners . though european countries have been deregulating everything from telecommunications to postal services and railways , german lawmakers have been reluctant to tamper with the pill market , resulting in protection against competition among pharmacies and continued high prices . as of 2004 , however , pharmacists are now allowed to own not just one , but up to three of their own stores . risky business pharmacists generally support limited access to medication , saying that it ensures public safety . " even minor painkillers contain risks and should only be sold by pharmacists who provide information on them and who sell them only in limited amounts , " said ursula sellerberg , a spokeswoman for the federation of german pharmacists ' associations -lrb- abda -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the sugar to make the medicine go down ?
still , " liberalization of who sells medication would mean greater competition and pharmacies would be forced to lower prices , " said kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . vogel said german consumer protection agencies , however , are advocating that pharmacies should still be required to provide information about medication risk . sellerberg , for her part , pointed out that stomach problems from mere aspirin can occur when taken in high doses . " we 're encouraging pharmacists to advise even for ' lighter ' medications , " she added . gaining ground chain drug stores where consumers can buy inexpensive over-the-counter medication or prescription drugs provided by a trained pharmacist have been non-existent in germany .
there 's no riteaid , no cvs , no duane read - to name some of the us 's largest retailers . that has begun to change over the past few months .
in july , former software engineer ralf däinghaus opened a docmorris - europe 's largest mail-order medication firm based in the netherlands - pharmacy in saarbrücken .
thus ensued a debate over whether germany should permit retail drug chains . on the one hand , german pharmacists say docmorris was violating german law , which forbids corporations from owning pharmacies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris store in saarbrücken in august on the other hand , saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the dutch docmorris to open shop in saarbrücken , said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law . " penny-pinchers some customers in saarbrücken were delighted , saying they could save up to 30 percent on prescription and over-the counter drugs at docmorris .
and they 're not cheap at traditional pharmacies : there a package of 20 brand-name aspirin tablets costs just under five euros -lrb- around $ 6.50 -rrb- , though a generic version of 30 tablets costs around half that . ralph däinghaus was proud to announce double the number of sales in the first month of opening the saarbrücken store , as compared to sales by the former pharmacy store he took over there . he " expected success , " he told germany 's tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- daily , because medication costs in germany are " scandalous " compared to france and belgium , where the same drugs cost half the price , taz wrote . german pharmacists were less than thrilled , however , and began worrying that their livelihoods were at stake and patients at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a " for apotheke or " pharmacy " däinghaus has also been in and out of court since july , with three saarbrücken pharmacists and two german pharmacy associations - who contested docmorris - eventually chalking up a victory when the saarland district court ordered the docmorris store in germany to be closed . " the decision was right based on german law , " said vogel , " but it is very likely that docmorris will go all the way to the european court of justice with countersuits and that the ban will be reversed and drug prices will eventually change in germany . " reform headaches in berlin , lawmakers plan to install a price cap on prescription drugs ; pharmacies could lower prices , but not raise them .
and , since only pharmacies are permitted to supply hospitals with drugs , politicians believe cheaper medication could also mean drastic savings in germany 's flailing public health care system . " but pharmacy costs make up only 2.7 percent of all the expenses of the public health care system , " said abda 's sellerberg .
" that 's only half of what the public insurance schemes need for their administrative tasks . " traditional pharmacists have been up-in-arms .
throughout november , thousands of them have staged protests across germany against health care reforms which they say threaten their existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional pharmacy in germany reform plans include a clause in which pharmacists would be expected to negotiate rebates between insurance groups and pharmaceutical manufacturers .
should they fail , pharmacists would have to contribute 500 millions euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- from their own pockets to the government . abda maintains this is unfair since costs for insurance companies have risen not because pharmacists maintain high prices , but because 80 percent of what public health insurers pay for patients ' medications goes to pharmaceutical manufacturers and taxes . kai vogel believes it 's only a matter of time until germany changes its ways and starts allowing more competition .
for now , he suggests that when shopping in pharmacies , consumers should request drug prices and ask for less expensive generic varieties . they should also make sure they do n't get a headache on sunday . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de internet pharmacies not bringing expected savings although ordering prescriptions over the internet has been made legal in germany as part of the reform measures instituted to help the burdened public health system , the expected savings have n't materialized .

socially disadvantaged families are particularly prone to such diets .
but a cooking course in hamburg hopes to change that . a cooking project in the hamburg neighborhood jensfeld , home to a large number of socially underprivileged families , is helping women rethink their families ' diets and start preparing more home-cooked meals . once a week for three hours , the participants learn how to whip up delicious healthy meals with little effort and a small budget .
home economics teacher sabine kuchenbecker said a lot of people do n't know that fast food is n't only unhealthy , it 's also expensive . she said a lot of young women who never learned how to cook automatically think it 's cheaper to buy ready-to-serve meals . " but it 's significantly less expensive to cook yourself , especially if you shop a bit price-consciously , " kuchenbecker said .
" it 's our job to relay these skills to these women . " battling the bulge with healthy cooking every fifth german is too fat , according to the world health organization .
this trend is particularly prominent among underprivileged families , which tend to eat fast food or ready-to-serve meals .
the results are serious health problems , such as diabetes at a young age , stiffening of the joints or even cardiovascular diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast food can lead to serious health problems for children the charity hamburger tafel or hamburg table is coordinating the project , which costs five euros -lrb- $ 6.60 -rrb- for the five-week course . for the participants , healthy is n't always easy to get used to , though .
the 33-year-old single mother katja does n't like mustard and turns her nose up as she takes a sniff of walnut oil to make homemade salad dressing . " well , it 's okay , but i think it 's a matter of taste , " katja said , who usually buys finished products , such as french dressing , which has lots of preservatives and is more fattening than homemade dressing . women like katja are common in neighborhoods like this .
but she wants to change her eating habits , she said . " i want to learn something about cooking and nutrition because it 's important for my daughter , " katja said .
her daughter is three years old and already slightly chubby .
katja 's unhealthy diet over the past years is evident in her figure , too . " i usually go to a snack bar or get pizza , " katja said .
but here , she has learned that homemade pizza , for example , only costs about a third of frozen pizza . cooking can spice up life instructor kuchenbecker said she wants to motivate these women to try out new things , such as using a different spice or tasting another type of salad .
participant gaby is taking the course for the second time and has learned a lot .
the 43-year-old mother of nine still has four children living at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetables are a healthy and affordable alternative to fast food " my kitchen always just had salt , pepper and paprika as spices , " gaby said .
" i did n't dare to try anything else .
now , when i make a soup , i put in oregano and thyme and it really tastes better to me . " even katja has tried her first homemade dressing with mustard and walnut oil , and it 's was n't bad , she said . " it tastes good now that i 've tried it , " katja said .
" i 'm going to make my own dressing from now on . " cooking can boost self-confidence but the hamburg course is about more than just affordable meals , kuchenbecker said .
it 's also about motivation .
a lot of these women have never gotten any confirmation in their lives .
many did poorly in school , for example . " when you simply say to them , ' wow , you did that well ' or ' you did a super job seasoning that , ' they really beam at you , as they 've maybe never heard that before in their lives , " kuchenbecker said . so that the women do n't forget what they 've learned , every participant gets a goodie bag at the end of the course .

the deutsche bank chief had agreed to pay the money - which amounts to three months ' of his current wages - out of his own pocket . charges were also dropped against the other five co-defendants , likewise in return for cash payments .
no verdict , no criminal record mannesmann 's former chairman , klaus esser , will have to fork out 1.5 million euros , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk 1.0 million euros , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel 60,000 euros and former works council members jürgen ladberg and dietmar droste will pay 30,000 euros and 12,500 euros respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , esser , funk , zwickel , from top left , clockwise under terms of the settlement , the men will not have a criminal record . the men had been accused of breach of fiduciary duty for their role in approving huge bonuses following the takeover of german telecom giant mannesmann in 2000 by british mobile phone giant vodafone .
they were accused of breaking the law by approving 111.5 million marks -lrb- 57 million euros -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives .
esser himself pocketed 16.4 million euros . the six men were originally acquitted in july 2004 .
but at the end of last year , the germany 's supreme court ordered a retrial , which opened just a month ago .
ethical can of worms the mannesmann case has not only put executive pay in germany in the spotlight .
it also raised ethical questions about what had been the successful transformation of mannesmann from an industrial conglomerate into a leading mobile telecommunications group . in the original trial , the court ruled that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . at the time of the mannesmann payouts , ackermann had been a member of the group 's supervisory board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense said the bonuses were a valid way to motivate company brass ackermann and his defense team argued that big payouts to executives , common in the united states and britain , were needed to motivate corporate leaders to take risks . after all , mannesmann had been transformed from a heavy engineering group into a telecommunications giant at the beginning of deregulation of telecommunications and the arrival of mobile telephones . esser argued during his trial that the price of shares in the company had doubled during his tenure . prosecutors contended that the payments were illegal because they were designed to persuade managers , and esser in particular , to drop their resistance to vodafone 's bid after a long takeover battle .
critics saw the bonuses , unprecedentedly high by german standards , as evidence of corporate greed , especially because many mannesmann employees were expected to lose their jobs as a result of the takeover . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

the scheme , established last year and ending in 2007 , aims to reduce carbon emissions by providing a market-based trading system .
it is based on limiting the total amount of co2 emissions , but can offer control over reductions flexibly and at a low-cost . it is designed to put caps on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by heavily polluting factories across europe .
but in 2006 , the governments of some eu countries gave away free carbon pollution permits that exceeded the amount of pollution that was released - which the european environment commission has decided to put a stop to . germany was the most generous , with france and poland also handing out carbon credits faster than pollution can be emitted .
only a few countries - such as britain and ireland - distributed allowances that fairly matched the needs of big companies . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas criticized several european countries , including germany , greece , ireland , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia and sweden , for giving away too many pollution allowances that they hold in reserve for building new factories . " today 's decision sends a strong signal that europe is fully committed to achieving the kyoto target and making the eu ets a success , " dimas said in a statement . drastic reductions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the carbon trading scheme is working towards meeting kyoto targets stephan singer , the head of the european climate and energy policy unit in brussels for the wwf , was pleased that the allowances for germany to pollute have been reduced " quite drastically . " " germany has proposed that once it gets an allocation for a coal fire station , the allocation would be valid for the next 14 years at least - which the commission objected to , " singer said .
" this is particularly good , considering that germany is the largest oecd country in the european union . " singer said the wwf would like to see the commission " keep persistent and as straight forward , to help europe to deliver on its kyoto targets . " germany under fire over carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coal industry will probably be affected by the commissions ruling germany was the most generous with the emission credit surpluses , producing 21.4 million tons , or 4.3 percent less in emissions than its average annual cap allowance , according to a report in the new york times . france , germany , italy , poland , spain and uk make up for 73 percent of overall eu emissions .
singer said that the permits to pollute , based on an earlier draft by the german government , were " quite horrible . " for a country that wants to lead the world in climate change and renewable energy , its allowances to grow its coal base in the power sector are a scandalous proposal to the commission , " he said . the german coal industry has come out against the commissions stance , arguing that it will hurt the utilities sector . singer responded by saying that if the coal industry is complaining about the decision , then " i know that dimas has done the right thing . " the wwf wants to see the commission review allowing countries or coal-fired power stations to buy emissions , like through auctioning . " auctioning of pollution permits would represent the ' polluter pays principle ' and the money then could be re-invested into climate protection measures , " he said . rachel ryan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister presses climate change action in wake of dire report on the heels of a major study that says world leaders must act urgently to avert a looming environmental catastrophe , germany 's environment minister has called on the country to invest heavily in green technology .

" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself .

the deutsche bank chief had agreed to pay the money - which amounts to three months ' of his current wages - out of his own pocket . charges were also dropped against the other five co-defendants , likewise in return for cash payments .
no verdict , no criminal record mannesmann 's former chairman , klaus esser , will have to fork out 1.5 million euros , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk 1.0 million euros , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel 60,000 euros and former works council members jürgen ladberg and dietmar droste will pay 30,000 euros and 12,500 euros respectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann , esser , funk , zwickel , from top left , clockwise under terms of the settlement , the men will not have a criminal record . the men had been accused of breach of fiduciary duty for their role in approving huge bonuses following the takeover of german telecom giant mannesmann in 2000 by british mobile phone giant vodafone .
they were accused of breaking the law by approving 111.5 million marks -lrb- 57 million euros -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives .
esser himself pocketed 16.4 million euros . the six men were originally acquitted in july 2004 .
but at the end of last year , the germany 's supreme court ordered a retrial , which opened just a month ago .
ethical can of worms the mannesmann case has not only put executive pay in germany in the spotlight .
it also raised ethical questions about what had been the successful transformation of mannesmann from an industrial conglomerate into a leading mobile telecommunications group . in the original trial , the court ruled that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . at the time of the mannesmann payouts , ackermann had been a member of the group 's supervisory board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense said the bonuses were a valid way to motivate company brass ackermann and his defense team argued that big payouts to executives , common in the united states and britain , were needed to motivate corporate leaders to take risks . after all , mannesmann had been transformed from a heavy engineering group into a telecommunications giant at the beginning of deregulation of telecommunications and the arrival of mobile telephones . esser argued during his trial that the price of shares in the company had doubled during his tenure . prosecutors contended that the payments were illegal because they were designed to persuade managers , and esser in particular , to drop their resistance to vodafone 's bid after a long takeover battle .
critics saw the bonuses , unprecedentedly high by german standards , as evidence of corporate greed , especially because many mannesmann employees were expected to lose their jobs as a result of the takeover . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense said the bonuses were a valid way to motivate company brass ackermann and his defense team argued that big payouts to executives , common in the united states and britain , were needed to motivate corporate leaders to take risks . after all , mannesmann had been transformed from a heavy engineering group into a telecommunications giant at the beginning of deregulation of telecommunications and the arrival of mobile telephones . esser argued during his trial that the price of shares in the company had doubled during his tenure . prosecutors contended that the payments were illegal because they were designed to persuade managers , and esser in particular , to drop their resistance to vodafone 's bid after a long takeover battle .
critics saw the bonuses , unprecedentedly high by german standards , as evidence of corporate greed , especially because many mannesmann employees were expected to lose their jobs as a result of the takeover . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

a new eu report sheds some light germany and 10 other states knew about secret cia prisons in europe , and obstructed investigations into the case , the european parliament said in a report . there were 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe , a european parliament committee said in a draft report on tuesday . " many governments cooperated passively or actively -lrb- with the cia -rrb- , " the committee 's rapporteur claudio fava said .
" they knew . " the draft , which was based on classified documents and secret informants , noted at least at least 1,245 suspicious flights through european air space or stopovers at european airports that took place at the request of the cia . the report was the result of an investigation by a special committee of the european parliament into " extraordinary rendition " - the us practice of transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for questioning . extraordinary rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report took the eu 's javier solana to task human rights groups accuse the united states of having used extraordinary rendition in order to interrogate suspected terrorists under methods not allowed in the us itself , including torture . the german government has dismissed the report , which came out tuesday .
the eu committee also claimed austria , great britain , italy , poland , sweden , ireland , spain , portugal , greece and cyprus knew about the prisons . the report urged officials in the individual eu countries to start their own investigations as to whether their governments have broken european human rights accords with their use of extraordinary rendition . it also criticizes eu foreign policy chief javier solana and anti-terror coordinator gijs de vries , accusing them of having given incomplete statements to the investigating committee . failure to cooperate the report was especially critical of solana , expressing its " profound preoccupation " with the " omissions " and " denials " when the eu 's top diplomat appeared before the committee , in may . germany and spain were the only countries fava said adequately cooperated with eu committee 's investigation .
fava offered little in the way of conclusions , simply inviting the eu authorities to " accept their responsibilities " to deal with the offending member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri wants an apology from the cia meanwhile , a us appeals court in the state of virginia has agreed to hear the case of german-lebanese citizen khaled el-masri against ex-cia chief george tenet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 29.11.2006 nato decides to bolster troubled afghan force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan remains at the top of nato 's priority list nato clinched an agreement wednesday to bolster its troubled mission in afghanistan by sending more troops and cutting restrictions on forces already there , while admitting that gaps remain . leaders of the 26-nation bloc , including us president george w. bush , also backed a french proposal to set up a " contact group " to coordinate action to prevent afghanistan slipping back toward chaos . closer to its traditional home ground , the leaders also agreed to admit serbia , montenegro and bosnia-herzegovina to its partnership for peace program , a decade after the wars that ripped the balkans apart . the pledge on afghanistan , announced at the end of a two-day summit in riga , came after the united states and britain in particular lobbied for more troops and fewer caveats on the forces in the violence-wracked country .
european heavyweight states like germany , france , spain and italy came under pressure to do more in southern afghanistan , where british-led troops have faced a growing death toll in fighting against taliban insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the chances for success in afghanistan had risen thanks to the summit chancellor angela merkel after the summit stressed that germany 's contribution to the afghanistan mission was highly valued by its nato partners .
she had also once more assured alliance members that germany would come to nato 's aid in emergencies beyond the locations where the bundeswehr is deployed . she added that solidarity demanded it and that it was clear " germany would n't close its eyes to this solidarity . " as an example , she suggested evacuating wounded soldiers from other nato states .
question of credibility nato took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in 2003 .
it currently comprises some 32,000 troops from 37 nations .
isaf has , however , faced increasingly fierce fighting since moving into the volatile south this year , and in september nato 's top commander us general james jones called for 2,500 extra military personnel . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the agreement on afghanistan . " everyone accepts this is nato 's absolutely critical mission , " he said .
" there is complete agreement around the table that nato 's credibility is ... on the line . " but he also admitted that shortfalls remained , with military chiefs saying that so far 85-90 percent of requirements were in place . " we have made significant progress but we still need to make those last remaining steps , " blair said . rapid reaction force nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer highlighted an agreement to deploy forces to help out in emergencies .
" in an emergency ... they will support each other , " he said .
" that is the most fundamental demonstration of nato 's solidarity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer the nato secretary general also confirmed that alliance leaders had supported french president jacques chirac 's proposal to establish an afghan " contact group . "
this could be along the lines of such a group set up for the balkans in the 1990s , comprising the united states , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , to coordinate diplomatic and other action to resolve the conflict . " i have been tasked ... to think about and to forward proposals on the possibility of a contact group for afghanistan , " de hoop scheffer added . overall , he said the nato summit was good news for the people of afghanistan , " the bottom line is that , five years after the fall of the taliban , afghanistan is making progress . "
" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself . " taking into account the importance of long-term stability in the western balkans and acknowledging the progress made so far ... we have invited these three countries to join partnership for peace , " said the nato declaration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was high for the summit and riga 's old town was almost deserted chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte criticized the invitation to the three states , her spokesman said after the summit . " the prosecutor regrets this decision because it looks like a reward for the lack of cooperation ... with the office of the prosecutor , " the spokesman , anton nikiforov , told reporters . nato leaders also decided to invite new countries to join the alliance without naming any country best placed to become a member . " at our next summit in 2008 , the alliance intends to extend further invitations to those countries who meet nato 's performance-based standards and are able to contribute to euro-atlantic security and stability , " they said . also in riga , the nato chiefs declared " fully operational " the alliance 's flagship 25,000-strong nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- .
the force , to be staffed by nato countries on a six-month rotating basis , will stand ready to be deployed within five days for combat missions , evacuations or disaster relief operations lasting for up to a month . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " in afghanistan , damage limitation is the only realistic option " nato 's mission in afghanistan has n't been a failure , but it still could be , cambridge university political scientist christopher hill told dw-world.de. -lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

european heavyweight states like germany , france , spain and italy came under pressure to do more in southern afghanistan , where british-led troops have faced a growing death toll in fighting against taliban insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the chances for success in afghanistan had risen thanks to the summit chancellor angela merkel after the summit stressed that germany 's contribution to the afghanistan mission was highly valued by its nato partners .
she had also once more assured alliance members that germany would come to nato 's aid in emergencies beyond the locations where the bundeswehr is deployed . she added that solidarity demanded it and that it was clear " germany would n't close its eyes to this solidarity . " as an example , she suggested evacuating wounded soldiers from other nato states .
question of credibility nato took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in 2003 .
it currently comprises some 32,000 troops from 37 nations .
isaf has , however , faced increasingly fierce fighting since moving into the volatile south this year , and in september nato 's top commander us general james jones called for 2,500 extra military personnel . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the agreement on afghanistan . " everyone accepts this is nato 's absolutely critical mission , " he said .
" there is complete agreement around the table that nato 's credibility is ... on the line . " but he also admitted that shortfalls remained , with military chiefs saying that so far 85-90 percent of requirements were in place . " we have made significant progress but we still need to make those last remaining steps , " blair said . rapid reaction force nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer highlighted an agreement to deploy forces to help out in emergencies .
" in an emergency ... they will support each other , " he said .
" that is the most fundamental demonstration of nato 's solidarity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer the nato secretary general also confirmed that alliance leaders had supported french president jacques chirac 's proposal to establish an afghan " contact group . "
this could be along the lines of such a group set up for the balkans in the 1990s , comprising the united states , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , to coordinate diplomatic and other action to resolve the conflict . " i have been tasked ... to think about and to forward proposals on the possibility of a contact group for afghanistan , " de hoop scheffer added . overall , he said the nato summit was good news for the people of afghanistan , " the bottom line is that , five years after the fall of the taliban , afghanistan is making progress . "
" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself . " taking into account the importance of long-term stability in the western balkans and acknowledging the progress made so far ... we have invited these three countries to join partnership for peace , " said the nato declaration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was high for the summit and riga 's old town was almost deserted chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte criticized the invitation to the three states , her spokesman said after the summit . " the prosecutor regrets this decision because it looks like a reward for the lack of cooperation ... with the office of the prosecutor , " the spokesman , anton nikiforov , told reporters . nato leaders also decided to invite new countries to join the alliance without naming any country best placed to become a member . " at our next summit in 2008 , the alliance intends to extend further invitations to those countries who meet nato 's performance-based standards and are able to contribute to euro-atlantic security and stability , " they said . also in riga , the nato chiefs declared " fully operational " the alliance 's flagship 25,000-strong nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- .
the force , to be staffed by nato countries on a six-month rotating basis , will stand ready to be deployed within five days for combat missions , evacuations or disaster relief operations lasting for up to a month . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " in afghanistan , damage limitation is the only realistic option " nato 's mission in afghanistan has n't been a failure , but it still could be , cambridge university political scientist christopher hill told dw-world.de. -lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

they might be invading your playground any day now the bavarian city of nuremberg is planning to open an exclusive playground for senior citizens .
are the elderly - and young people alike - in germany ready for this new chapter in the war between generations ? senior citizens are a highly misunderstood group of germans .
their sole purpose in life is not - despite what many people think - to shut down their young neighbor 's parties by calling the police , to grumble about dog poop in the streets , or throw hysterical fits if their train arrives five minutes behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , the founding mother of gray panthers , is 81 senior citizens are also politically conscious and active people .
last year , a german activist group called gray panthers celebrated its 30th anniversary of fighting for senior rights .
in 1989 , the gray panthers even established a political wing - the grays - a party whose results usually appeared as an invisible condiment on the smallest slice of an election pie-chart marked " others . " but even the grays ' political invisibility seems to be becoming a thing of the past .
in the last municipal elections in berlin , the grays won the unprecedented 3.8 percent of the votes .
german seniors are coming .
with a vengeance . let 's play clever politicians know how to spot trends early .
that is why the bavarian city of nuremberg decided to jump on the bandwagon of senior renaissance and open a senior citizens ' playground , where grandmas and grandpas could get together to bowl , play chess or simply hang out with their peers .
if you 're under 60 : tough luck !
you 'll have to look for friends elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do they have to be that loud ?
" it will be a place where the senior generation can find a refuge from younger people , " said deputy mayor horst förther , who is also in charge of sport activities in the city .
" we agreed that it was a good idea , given our demographic changes . " the project in nuremberg was inspired by research from the finnish university of lapland .
the experiments with what finnish researchers called " three-generational play " showed that senior citizens experienced significant improvements in balance , co-ordination and speed after only three months of " playing . " dangers ahead " i am considering a running track , a path for roller-skating , a soft badminton court and a trampoline , which is easy on the joints , " förther said .
" all activities can be carried out slowly so that the old people are n't pushed beyond their limits . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is munch 's " scream " about modernist angst or a child off a trampoline ?
parents who ever made the fatal mistake of purchasing a trampoline for their children - losing , as a consequence , the peace of their mind and the quiet of their garden - would beg to differ .
a trampoline may be easy on the joints , but it is known to produce an adrenaline rush in children on pair with bungee jumping off the chinese yangtze river tamer known as the three gorges dam .
it turns children into wild , uncontrollable , self-sustainable noise-machines .
it may have the same effect on senior citizens . " retired people need a space to be themselves without someone coming along and spilling ice-cream on their trousers or breakdancing , " said social worker andrea weber , who specializes in the lifestyle of the elderly . a cultural shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more playground sharing !
aside from the question whether ice-cream eating breakdancers have nothing better to do than throw scoops of chocolate-vanilla gelato at the local senior population , the german war of generations may take a turn for the bizarre . if , in early afternoon hours , playgrounds start filling with bouncing and screaming grandpas , those very same young people who had their party shut down the night before by their intolerant neighbors , may have to resort to calling the police to whine about the jumping geriatrics of germany ruining their alternative , hung-over , 4-pm breakfast . things could get really interesting . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 29.11.2006 nato decides to bolster troubled afghan force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan remains at the top of nato 's priority list nato clinched an agreement wednesday to bolster its troubled mission in afghanistan by sending more troops and cutting restrictions on forces already there , while admitting that gaps remain . leaders of the 26-nation bloc , including us president george w. bush , also backed a french proposal to set up a " contact group " to coordinate action to prevent afghanistan slipping back toward chaos . closer to its traditional home ground , the leaders also agreed to admit serbia , montenegro and bosnia-herzegovina to its partnership for peace program , a decade after the wars that ripped the balkans apart . the pledge on afghanistan , announced at the end of a two-day summit in riga , came after the united states and britain in particular lobbied for more troops and fewer caveats on the forces in the violence-wracked country .
european heavyweight states like germany , france , spain and italy came under pressure to do more in southern afghanistan , where british-led troops have faced a growing death toll in fighting against taliban insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the chances for success in afghanistan had risen thanks to the summit chancellor angela merkel after the summit stressed that germany 's contribution to the afghanistan mission was highly valued by its nato partners .
she had also once more assured alliance members that germany would come to nato 's aid in emergencies beyond the locations where the bundeswehr is deployed . she added that solidarity demanded it and that it was clear " germany would n't close its eyes to this solidarity . " as an example , she suggested evacuating wounded soldiers from other nato states .
question of credibility nato took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in 2003 .
it currently comprises some 32,000 troops from 37 nations .
isaf has , however , faced increasingly fierce fighting since moving into the volatile south this year , and in september nato 's top commander us general james jones called for 2,500 extra military personnel . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the agreement on afghanistan . " everyone accepts this is nato 's absolutely critical mission , " he said .
" there is complete agreement around the table that nato 's credibility is ... on the line . " but he also admitted that shortfalls remained , with military chiefs saying that so far 85-90 percent of requirements were in place . " we have made significant progress but we still need to make those last remaining steps , " blair said . rapid reaction force nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer highlighted an agreement to deploy forces to help out in emergencies .
" in an emergency ... they will support each other , " he said .
" that is the most fundamental demonstration of nato 's solidarity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer the nato secretary general also confirmed that alliance leaders had supported french president jacques chirac 's proposal to establish an afghan " contact group . "
this could be along the lines of such a group set up for the balkans in the 1990s , comprising the united states , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , to coordinate diplomatic and other action to resolve the conflict . " i have been tasked ... to think about and to forward proposals on the possibility of a contact group for afghanistan , " de hoop scheffer added . overall , he said the nato summit was good news for the people of afghanistan , " the bottom line is that , five years after the fall of the taliban , afghanistan is making progress . "
" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself . " taking into account the importance of long-term stability in the western balkans and acknowledging the progress made so far ... we have invited these three countries to join partnership for peace , " said the nato declaration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 29.11.2006 cooking course takes a bite out of obesity in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : curried sausage is a fast food staple in germany western populations are getting fatter , due to too little exercise and too much fast food .
socially disadvantaged families are particularly prone to such diets .
but a cooking course in hamburg hopes to change that . a cooking project in the hamburg neighborhood jensfeld , home to a large number of socially underprivileged families , is helping women rethink their families ' diets and start preparing more home-cooked meals . once a week for three hours , the participants learn how to whip up delicious healthy meals with little effort and a small budget .
home economics teacher sabine kuchenbecker said a lot of people do n't know that fast food is n't only unhealthy , it 's also expensive . she said a lot of young women who never learned how to cook automatically think it 's cheaper to buy ready-to-serve meals . " but it 's significantly less expensive to cook yourself , especially if you shop a bit price-consciously , " kuchenbecker said .
" it 's our job to relay these skills to these women . " battling the bulge with healthy cooking every fifth german is too fat , according to the world health organization .
this trend is particularly prominent among underprivileged families , which tend to eat fast food or ready-to-serve meals .
the results are serious health problems , such as diabetes at a young age , stiffening of the joints or even cardiovascular diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast food can lead to serious health problems for children the charity hamburger tafel or hamburg table is coordinating the project , which costs five euros -lrb- $ 6.60 -rrb- for the five-week course . for the participants , healthy is n't always easy to get used to , though .
the 33-year-old single mother katja does n't like mustard and turns her nose up as she takes a sniff of walnut oil to make homemade salad dressing . " well , it 's okay , but i think it 's a matter of taste , " katja said , who usually buys finished products , such as french dressing , which has lots of preservatives and is more fattening than homemade dressing . women like katja are common in neighborhoods like this .
but she wants to change her eating habits , she said . " i want to learn something about cooking and nutrition because it 's important for my daughter , " katja said .
her daughter is three years old and already slightly chubby .
katja 's unhealthy diet over the past years is evident in her figure , too . " i usually go to a snack bar or get pizza , " katja said .
but here , she has learned that homemade pizza , for example , only costs about a third of frozen pizza . cooking can spice up life instructor kuchenbecker said she wants to motivate these women to try out new things , such as using a different spice or tasting another type of salad .
participant gaby is taking the course for the second time and has learned a lot .
the 43-year-old mother of nine still has four children living at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetables are a healthy and affordable alternative to fast food " my kitchen always just had salt , pepper and paprika as spices , " gaby said .
" i did n't dare to try anything else .
now , when i make a soup , i put in oregano and thyme and it really tastes better to me . " even katja has tried her first homemade dressing with mustard and walnut oil , and it 's was n't bad , she said . " it tastes good now that i 've tried it , " katja said .
" i 'm going to make my own dressing from now on . " cooking can boost self-confidence but the hamburg course is about more than just affordable meals , kuchenbecker said .
it 's also about motivation .
a lot of these women have never gotten any confirmation in their lives .
many did poorly in school , for example . " when you simply say to them , ' wow , you did that well ' or ' you did a super job seasoning that , ' they really beam at you , as they 've maybe never heard that before in their lives , " kuchenbecker said . so that the women do n't forget what they 've learned , every participant gets a goodie bag at the end of the course .

the deutsche bank chief had agreed to pay the money - which amounts to three months ' of his current wages - out of his own pocket . charges were also dropped against the other five co-defendants , likewise in return for cash payments .

they were accused of breaking the law by approving 111.5 million marks -lrb- 57 million euros -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives .

but at the end of last year , the germany 's supreme court ordered a retrial , which opened just a month ago .
ethical can of worms the mannesmann case has not only put executive pay in germany in the spotlight .
it also raised ethical questions about what had been the successful transformation of mannesmann from an industrial conglomerate into a leading mobile telecommunications group . in the original trial , the court ruled that while the size of the payouts went against mannesmann 's interests and were therefore not admissible under german stock law , they did not constitute criminal action , as claimed by the prosecution . at the time of the mannesmann payouts , ackermann had been a member of the group 's supervisory board .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defense said the bonuses were a valid way to motivate company brass ackermann and his defense team argued that big payouts to executives , common in the united states and britain , were needed to motivate corporate leaders to take risks . after all , mannesmann had been transformed from a heavy engineering group into a telecommunications giant at the beginning of deregulation of telecommunications and the arrival of mobile telephones . esser argued during his trial that the price of shares in the company had doubled during his tenure . prosecutors contended that the payments were illegal because they were designed to persuade managers , and esser in particular , to drop their resistance to vodafone 's bid after a long takeover battle .
critics saw the bonuses , unprecedentedly high by german standards , as evidence of corporate greed , especially because many mannesmann employees were expected to lose their jobs as a result of the takeover . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

the deutsche bank chief had agreed to pay the money - which amounts to three months ' of his current wages - out of his own pocket . charges were also dropped against the other five co-defendants , likewise in return for cash payments .
no verdict , no criminal record mannesmann 's former chairman , klaus esser , will have to fork out 1.5 million euros , mannesmann 's former supervisory board chief joachim funk 1.0 million euros , the former head of the powerful ig metall labor union , klaus zwickel 60,000 euros and former works council members jürgen ladberg and dietmar droste will pay 30,000 euros and 12,500 euros respectively .

they were accused of breaking the law by approving 111.5 million marks -lrb- 57 million euros -rrb- in payouts for former mannesmann executives .
esser himself pocketed 16.4 million euros . the six men were originally acquitted in july 2004 .
but at the end of last year , the germany 's supreme court ordered a retrial , which opened just a month ago .

the scheme , established last year and ending in 2007 , aims to reduce carbon emissions by providing a market-based trading system .
it is based on limiting the total amount of co2 emissions , but can offer control over reductions flexibly and at a low-cost . it is designed to put caps on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by heavily polluting factories across europe .
but in 2006 , the governments of some eu countries gave away free carbon pollution permits that exceeded the amount of pollution that was released - which the european environment commission has decided to put a stop to . germany was the most generous , with france and poland also handing out carbon credits faster than pollution can be emitted .
only a few countries - such as britain and ireland - distributed allowances that fairly matched the needs of big companies . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas criticized several european countries , including germany , greece , ireland , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia and sweden , for giving away too many pollution allowances that they hold in reserve for building new factories . " today 's decision sends a strong signal that europe is fully committed to achieving the kyoto target and making the eu ets a success , " dimas said in a statement . drastic reductions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the carbon trading scheme is working towards meeting kyoto targets stephan singer , the head of the european climate and energy policy unit in brussels for the wwf , was pleased that the allowances for germany to pollute have been reduced " quite drastically . " " germany has proposed that once it gets an allocation for a coal fire station , the allocation would be valid for the next 14 years at least - which the commission objected to , " singer said .
" this is particularly good , considering that germany is the largest oecd country in the european union .

singer said that the permits to pollute , based on an earlier draft by the german government , were " quite horrible . " for a country that wants to lead the world in climate change and renewable energy , its allowances to grow its coal base in the power sector are a scandalous proposal to the commission , " he said . the german coal industry has come out against the commissions stance , arguing that it will hurt the utilities sector . singer responded by saying that if the coal industry is complaining about the decision , then " i know that dimas has done the right thing . " the wwf wants to see the commission review allowing countries or coal-fired power stations to buy emissions , like through auctioning .

the scheme , established last year and ending in 2007 , aims to reduce carbon emissions by providing a market-based trading system .
it is based on limiting the total amount of co2 emissions , but can offer control over reductions flexibly and at a low-cost . it is designed to put caps on the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by heavily polluting factories across europe .
but in 2006 , the governments of some eu countries gave away free carbon pollution permits that exceeded the amount of pollution that was released - which the european environment commission has decided to put a stop to . germany was the most generous , with france and poland also handing out carbon credits faster than pollution can be emitted .
only a few countries - such as britain and ireland - distributed allowances that fairly matched the needs of big companies . eu environment commissioner stavros dimas criticized several european countries , including germany , greece , ireland , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , slovakia and sweden , for giving away too many pollution allowances that they hold in reserve for building new factories . " today 's decision sends a strong signal that europe is fully committed to achieving the kyoto target and making the eu ets a success , " dimas said in a statement . drastic reductions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the carbon trading scheme is working towards meeting kyoto targets stephan singer , the head of the european climate and energy policy unit in brussels for the wwf , was pleased that the allowances for germany to pollute have been reduced " quite drastically . " " germany has proposed that once it gets an allocation for a coal fire station , the allocation would be valid for the next 14 years at least - which the commission objected to , " singer said .
" this is particularly good , considering that germany is the largest oecd country in the european union . " singer said the wwf would like to see the commission " keep persistent and as straight forward , to help europe to deliver on its kyoto targets . " germany under fire over carbon trading bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coal industry will probably be affected by the commissions ruling germany was the most generous with the emission credit surpluses , producing 21.4 million tons , or 4.3 percent less in emissions than its average annual cap allowance , according to a report in the new york times . france , germany , italy , poland , spain and uk make up for 73 percent of overall eu emissions .
singer said that the permits to pollute , based on an earlier draft by the german government , were " quite horrible . " for a country that wants to lead the world in climate change and renewable energy , its allowances to grow its coal base in the power sector are a scandalous proposal to the commission , " he said . the german coal industry has come out against the commissions stance , arguing that it will hurt the utilities sector . singer responded by saying that if the coal industry is complaining about the decision , then " i know that dimas has done the right thing . " the wwf wants to see the commission review allowing countries or coal-fired power stations to buy emissions , like through auctioning . " auctioning of pollution permits would represent the ' polluter pays principle ' and the money then could be re-invested into climate protection measures , " he said . rachel ryan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister presses climate change action in wake of dire report on the heels of a major study that says world leaders must act urgently to avert a looming environmental catastrophe , germany 's environment minister has called on the country to invest heavily in green technology .

a new eu report sheds some light germany and 10 other states knew about secret cia prisons in europe , and obstructed investigations into the case , the european parliament said in a report . there were 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe , a european parliament committee said in a draft report on tuesday . " many governments cooperated passively or actively -lrb- with the cia -rrb- , " the committee 's rapporteur claudio fava said .
" they knew . " the draft , which was based on classified documents and secret informants , noted at least at least 1,245 suspicious flights through european air space or stopovers at european airports that took place at the request of the cia . the report was the result of an investigation by a special committee of the european parliament into " extraordinary rendition " - the us practice of transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for questioning . extraordinary rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report took the eu 's javier solana to task human rights groups accuse the united states of having used extraordinary rendition in order to interrogate suspected terrorists under methods not allowed in the us itself , including torture . the german government has dismissed the report , which came out tuesday .
the eu committee also claimed austria , great britain , italy , poland , sweden , ireland , spain , portugal , greece and cyprus knew about the prisons . the report urged officials in the individual eu countries to start their own investigations as to whether their governments have broken european human rights accords with their use of extraordinary rendition . it also criticizes eu foreign policy chief javier solana and anti-terror coordinator gijs de vries , accusing them of having given incomplete statements to the investigating committee . failure to cooperate the report was especially critical of solana , expressing its " profound preoccupation " with the " omissions " and " denials " when the eu 's top diplomat appeared before the committee , in may . germany and spain were the only countries fava said adequately cooperated with eu committee 's investigation .
fava offered little in the way of conclusions , simply inviting the eu authorities to " accept their responsibilities " to deal with the offending member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri wants an apology from the cia meanwhile , a us appeals court in the state of virginia has agreed to hear the case of german-lebanese citizen khaled el-masri against ex-cia chief george tenet .
el-masri accused the cia of taking prison in afghanistan , where he was allegedly beaten , in a case of mistaken identity . el-masri is seeking damages of at least $ 75,000 -lrb- 57,142 euros -rrb- on allegations of unlawful capture , imprisonment , torture and other human rights violations .
a decision is expected next week , a spokesman for the richmond court said . in may , a lower us court had refused to hear the case that sparked a parliamentary investigation in germany , saying it would uncover state secrets and thus endanger the public . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators examine possibility of secret us prison in germany german federal prosecutors announced saturday that they are looking into claims of human rights violations stemming from the alleged detention of terror suspects at secret us prisons in germany .

european heavyweight states like germany , france , spain and italy came under pressure to do more in southern afghanistan , where british-led troops have faced a growing death toll in fighting against taliban insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the chances for success in afghanistan had risen thanks to the summit chancellor angela merkel after the summit stressed that germany 's contribution to the afghanistan mission was highly valued by its nato partners .
she had also once more assured alliance members that germany would come to nato 's aid in emergencies beyond the locations where the bundeswehr is deployed . she added that solidarity demanded it and that it was clear " germany would n't close its eyes to this solidarity . " as an example , she suggested evacuating wounded soldiers from other nato states .
question of credibility nato took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in 2003 .
it currently comprises some 32,000 troops from 37 nations .
isaf has , however , faced increasingly fierce fighting since moving into the volatile south this year , and in september nato 's top commander us general james jones called for 2,500 extra military personnel . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the agreement on afghanistan . " everyone accepts this is nato 's absolutely critical mission , " he said .
" there is complete agreement around the table that nato 's credibility is ... on the line . " but he also admitted that shortfalls remained , with military chiefs saying that so far 85-90 percent of requirements were in place . " we have made significant progress but we still need to make those last remaining steps , " blair said . rapid reaction force nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer highlighted an agreement to deploy forces to help out in emergencies .
" in an emergency ... they will support each other , " he said .
" that is the most fundamental demonstration of nato 's solidarity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer the nato secretary general also confirmed that alliance leaders had supported french president jacques chirac 's proposal to establish an afghan " contact group . "
this could be along the lines of such a group set up for the balkans in the 1990s , comprising the united states , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , to coordinate diplomatic and other action to resolve the conflict . " i have been tasked ... to think about and to forward proposals on the possibility of a contact group for afghanistan , " de hoop scheffer added . overall , he said the nato summit was good news for the people of afghanistan , " the bottom line is that , five years after the fall of the taliban , afghanistan is making progress . "
" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself . " taking into account the importance of long-term stability in the western balkans and acknowledging the progress made so far ... we have invited these three countries to join partnership for peace , " said the nato declaration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was high for the summit and riga 's old town was almost deserted chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte criticized the invitation to the three states , her spokesman said after the summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 29.11.2006 nato decides to bolster troubled afghan force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan remains at the top of nato 's priority list nato clinched an agreement wednesday to bolster its troubled mission in afghanistan by sending more troops and cutting restrictions on forces already there , while admitting that gaps remain . leaders of the 26-nation bloc , including us president george w. bush , also backed a french proposal to set up a " contact group " to coordinate action to prevent afghanistan slipping back toward chaos . closer to its traditional home ground , the leaders also agreed to admit serbia , montenegro and bosnia-herzegovina to its partnership for peace program , a decade after the wars that ripped the balkans apart . the pledge on afghanistan , announced at the end of a two-day summit in riga , came after the united states and britain in particular lobbied for more troops and fewer caveats on the forces in the violence-wracked country .
european heavyweight states like germany , france , spain and italy came under pressure to do more in southern afghanistan , where british-led troops have faced a growing death toll in fighting against taliban insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the chances for success in afghanistan had risen thanks to the summit chancellor angela merkel after the summit stressed that germany 's contribution to the afghanistan mission was highly valued by its nato partners .
she had also once more assured alliance members that germany would come to nato 's aid in emergencies beyond the locations where the bundeswehr is deployed . she added that solidarity demanded it and that it was clear " germany would n't close its eyes to this solidarity . " as an example , she suggested evacuating wounded soldiers from other nato states .
question of credibility nato took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in 2003 .
it currently comprises some 32,000 troops from 37 nations .
isaf has , however , faced increasingly fierce fighting since moving into the volatile south this year , and in september nato 's top commander us general james jones called for 2,500 extra military personnel . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the agreement on afghanistan . " everyone accepts this is nato 's absolutely critical mission , " he said .
" there is complete agreement around the table that nato 's credibility is ... on the line . " but he also admitted that shortfalls remained , with military chiefs saying that so far 85-90 percent of requirements were in place . " we have made significant progress but we still need to make those last remaining steps , " blair said . rapid reaction force nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer highlighted an agreement to deploy forces to help out in emergencies .
" in an emergency ... they will support each other , " he said .
" that is the most fundamental demonstration of nato 's solidarity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer the nato secretary general also confirmed that alliance leaders had supported french president jacques chirac 's proposal to establish an afghan " contact group . "
this could be along the lines of such a group set up for the balkans in the 1990s , comprising the united states , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , to coordinate diplomatic and other action to resolve the conflict . " i have been tasked ... to think about and to forward proposals on the possibility of a contact group for afghanistan , " de hoop scheffer added . overall , he said the nato summit was good news for the people of afghanistan , " the bottom line is that , five years after the fall of the taliban , afghanistan is making progress . "
" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself . " taking into account the importance of long-term stability in the western balkans and acknowledging the progress made so far ... we have invited these three countries to join partnership for peace , " said the nato declaration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was high for the summit and riga 's old town was almost deserted chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte criticized the invitation to the three states , her spokesman said after the summit . " the prosecutor regrets this decision because it looks like a reward for the lack of cooperation ... with the office of the prosecutor , " the spokesman , anton nikiforov , told reporters . nato leaders also decided to invite new countries to join the alliance without naming any country best placed to become a member .

the plant which employs 900 people would then be dismantled and rebuilt elsewhere by 2015 . the final details will be worked out over the next months but fraport has already agreed to recompense celanese with a sum of 650 million euros -lrb- $ 855 million -rrb- .
some 20 million euros will be paid to the chemicals company as early as this year . objections due to security and environmental risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forests will have to be destroyed so the airport can expand ticona had originally objected to fraport 's plans because they feared it would represent a security risk to have jets flying in and taking off at heights of just 70 meters -lrb- 76 yards -rrb- over the chemicals factory . environmental protection groups also oppose the plan because it will require the clearance of over 160 hectares of protected forest , as well as entail increased noise pollution for nearby inhabitants . however , fraport saw ticona 's security objections as a more serious threat to its expansion plans , which are supported by hesse 's regional state premier roland koch and have been floating around for over 10 years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's second-busiest airport frankfurt 's airport authority insists that the construction of a fourth runway is vital to its plans to expand europe 's second-busiest airport after london heathrow and secure thousands of jobs in the region .
while air traffic in europe continues to expand massively , frankfurt airport is already operating at the limit of its capacity .
fraport argues that an extra runway could boost capacity by half and the company is also planning to build a third terminal .
it hopes that the new runway will be operational by 2010 . the total investment required for the group 's expansion plans is thought to be about 3.2 billion euros . relocation of ticona plant means loss of jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fraport wants to avoid scenes such as these the frankfurter rundschau daily reported that the ticona plant would be relocated to a nearby suburb of frankfurt , where celanese 's parent company hoechst was originally located .
a spokesman for celanese declined to comment but insisted the plant would remain in germany . the hesse region 's opposition spd and green parties were critical of the deal , saying that thousands of jobs would be axed as part of the relocation . under the terms of the deal , fraport has agreed to set up an employment company for ticona employees who can not be transferred .
the hesse authorities will also be involved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stock exchange in frankfurt " the fact that an employment company is being set up is a clear sign of what 's to come , " said the greens ' chief whip frank kaufmann .
he said that it made no economic sense to expand an airport in such a densely-populated area . however , fraport chairman william bender welcomed the deal in the name of common sense . " time is money , " he said .
" and every day that global air traffic flies past us is a lost day for our company and our employees , as well as for the region and the people who live here . " although investors are in favor of the expansion plans , they appeared concerned by the costs .

socially disadvantaged families are particularly prone to such diets .
but a cooking course in hamburg hopes to change that . a cooking project in the hamburg neighborhood jensfeld , home to a large number of socially underprivileged families , is helping women rethink their families ' diets and start preparing more home-cooked meals . once a week for three hours , the participants learn how to whip up delicious healthy meals with little effort and a small budget .
home economics teacher sabine kuchenbecker said a lot of people do n't know that fast food is n't only unhealthy , it 's also expensive . she said a lot of young women who never learned how to cook automatically think it 's cheaper to buy ready-to-serve meals . " but it 's significantly less expensive to cook yourself , especially if you shop a bit price-consciously , " kuchenbecker said .
" it 's our job to relay these skills to these women . " battling the bulge with healthy cooking every fifth german is too fat , according to the world health organization .
this trend is particularly prominent among underprivileged families , which tend to eat fast food or ready-to-serve meals .
the results are serious health problems , such as diabetes at a young age , stiffening of the joints or even cardiovascular diseases . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast food can lead to serious health problems for children the charity hamburger tafel or hamburg table is coordinating the project , which costs five euros -lrb- $ 6.60 -rrb- for the five-week course . for the participants , healthy is n't always easy to get used to , though .
the 33-year-old single mother katja does n't like mustard and turns her nose up as she takes a sniff of walnut oil to make homemade salad dressing . " well , it 's okay , but i think it 's a matter of taste , " katja said , who usually buys finished products , such as french dressing , which has lots of preservatives and is more fattening than homemade dressing . women like katja are common in neighborhoods like this .
but she wants to change her eating habits , she said . " i want to learn something about cooking and nutrition because it 's important for my daughter , " katja said .
her daughter is three years old and already slightly chubby .
katja 's unhealthy diet over the past years is evident in her figure , too . " i usually go to a snack bar or get pizza , " katja said .
but here , she has learned that homemade pizza , for example , only costs about a third of frozen pizza . cooking can spice up life instructor kuchenbecker said she wants to motivate these women to try out new things , such as using a different spice or tasting another type of salad .
participant gaby is taking the course for the second time and has learned a lot .
the 43-year-old mother of nine still has four children living at home . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vegetables are a healthy and affordable alternative to fast food " my kitchen always just had salt , pepper and paprika as spices , " gaby said .
" i did n't dare to try anything else .
now , when i make a soup , i put in oregano and thyme and it really tastes better to me . " even katja has tried her first homemade dressing with mustard and walnut oil , and it 's was n't bad , she said . " it tastes good now that i 've tried it , " katja said .
" i 'm going to make my own dressing from now on . " cooking can boost self-confidence but the hamburg course is about more than just affordable meals , kuchenbecker said .
it 's also about motivation .
a lot of these women have never gotten any confirmation in their lives .
many did poorly in school , for example . " when you simply say to them , ' wow , you did that well ' or ' you did a super job seasoning that , ' they really beam at you , as they 've maybe never heard that before in their lives , " kuchenbecker said . so that the women do n't forget what they 've learned , every participant gets a goodie bag at the end of the course .

a new eu report sheds some light germany and 10 other states knew about secret cia prisons in europe , and obstructed investigations into the case , the european parliament said in a report . there were 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe , a european parliament committee said in a draft report on tuesday . " many governments cooperated passively or actively -lrb- with the cia -rrb- , " the committee 's rapporteur claudio fava said .
" they knew . " the draft , which was based on classified documents and secret informants , noted at least at least 1,245 suspicious flights through european air space or stopovers at european airports that took place at the request of the cia . the report was the result of an investigation by a special committee of the european parliament into " extraordinary rendition " - the us practice of transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for questioning . extraordinary rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report took the eu 's javier solana to task human rights groups accuse the united states of having used extraordinary rendition in order to interrogate suspected terrorists under methods not allowed in the us itself , including torture . the german government has dismissed the report , which came out tuesday .
the eu committee also claimed austria , great britain , italy , poland , sweden , ireland , spain , portugal , greece and cyprus knew about the prisons . the report urged officials in the individual eu countries to start their own investigations as to whether their governments have broken european human rights accords with their use of extraordinary rendition . it also criticizes eu foreign policy chief javier solana and anti-terror coordinator gijs de vries , accusing them of having given incomplete statements to the investigating committee . failure to cooperate the report was especially critical of solana , expressing its " profound preoccupation " with the " omissions " and " denials " when the eu 's top diplomat appeared before the committee , in may . germany and spain were the only countries fava said adequately cooperated with eu committee 's investigation .
fava offered little in the way of conclusions , simply inviting the eu authorities to " accept their responsibilities " to deal with the offending member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri wants an apology from the cia meanwhile , a us appeals court in the state of virginia has agreed to hear the case of german-lebanese citizen khaled el-masri against ex-cia chief george tenet .
el-masri accused the cia of taking prison in afghanistan , where he was allegedly beaten , in a case of mistaken identity . el-masri is seeking damages of at least $ 75,000 -lrb- 57,142 euros -rrb- on allegations of unlawful capture , imprisonment , torture and other human rights violations .
a decision is expected next week , a spokesman for the richmond court said . in may , a lower us court had refused to hear the case that sparked a parliamentary investigation in germany , saying it would uncover state secrets and thus endanger the public . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators examine possibility of secret us prison in germany german federal prosecutors announced saturday that they are looking into claims of human rights violations stemming from the alleged detention of terror suspects at secret us prisons in germany .

only pharmacies run by certified pharmacy owners may sell medicinal drugs , but the meds monopoly has been getting a run for its money of late . got an excruciating headache ?
need an aspirin lickety-split ?
well , if you 're in germany and it 's a sunday , forget about grabbing a bottle of over-the-counter painkillers at the grocery store . not only are german grocery stores not open sundays , you wo n't find aspirin there anyway .
unless you have friends or neighbors with aspirin on hand , you 'll just have to wrestle with the hellish mindgrip unless you 're willing to shlep around town to find the emergency pharmacy on duty . limited access , high prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head ready to explode ?
aspirin is expensive and hard to buy in germany for decades , germany 's restrictive laws have limited the selling of medications only to pharmacies , which must be personally run by registered pharmacy owners . though european countries have been deregulating everything from telecommunications to postal services and railways , german lawmakers have been reluctant to tamper with the pill market , resulting in protection against competition among pharmacies and continued high prices . as of 2004 , however , pharmacists are now allowed to own not just one , but up to three of their own stores . risky business pharmacists generally support limited access to medication , saying that it ensures public safety . " even minor painkillers contain risks and should only be sold by pharmacists who provide information on them and who sell them only in limited amounts , " said ursula sellerberg , a spokeswoman for the federation of german pharmacists ' associations -lrb- abda -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the sugar to make the medicine go down ?
still , " liberalization of who sells medication would mean greater competition and pharmacies would be forced to lower prices , " said kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . vogel said german consumer protection agencies , however , are advocating that pharmacies should still be required to provide information about medication risk . sellerberg , for her part , pointed out that stomach problems from mere aspirin can occur when taken in high doses . " we 're encouraging pharmacists to advise even for ' lighter ' medications , " she added . gaining ground chain drug stores where consumers can buy inexpensive over-the-counter medication or prescription drugs provided by a trained pharmacist have been non-existent in germany .
there 's no riteaid , no cvs , no duane read - to name some of the us 's largest retailers . that has begun to change over the past few months .
in july , former software engineer ralf däinghaus opened a docmorris - europe 's largest mail-order medication firm based in the netherlands - pharmacy in saarbrücken .
thus ensued a debate over whether germany should permit retail drug chains . on the one hand , german pharmacists say docmorris was violating german law , which forbids corporations from owning pharmacies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris store in saarbrücken in august on the other hand , saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the dutch docmorris to open shop in saarbrücken , said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law . " penny-pinchers some customers in saarbrücken were delighted , saying they could save up to 30 percent on prescription and over-the counter drugs at docmorris .
and they 're not cheap at traditional pharmacies : there a package of 20 brand-name aspirin tablets costs just under five euros -lrb- around $ 6.50 -rrb- , though a generic version of 30 tablets costs around half that . ralph däinghaus was proud to announce double the number of sales in the first month of opening the saarbrücken store , as compared to sales by the former pharmacy store he took over there . he " expected success , " he told germany 's tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- daily , because medication costs in germany are " scandalous " compared to france and belgium , where the same drugs cost half the price , taz wrote . german pharmacists were less than thrilled , however , and began worrying that their livelihoods were at stake and patients at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a " for apotheke or " pharmacy " däinghaus has also been in and out of court since july , with three saarbrücken pharmacists and two german pharmacy associations - who contested docmorris - eventually chalking up a victory when the saarland district court ordered the docmorris store in germany to be closed . " the decision was right based on german law , " said vogel , " but it is very likely that docmorris will go all the way to the european court of justice with countersuits and that the ban will be reversed and drug prices will eventually change in germany . " reform headaches in berlin , lawmakers plan to install a price cap on prescription drugs ; pharmacies could lower prices , but not raise them .
and , since only pharmacies are permitted to supply hospitals with drugs , politicians believe cheaper medication could also mean drastic savings in germany 's flailing public health care system . " but pharmacy costs make up only 2.7 percent of all the expenses of the public health care system , " said abda 's sellerberg .
" that 's only half of what the public insurance schemes need for their administrative tasks . " traditional pharmacists have been up-in-arms .
throughout november , thousands of them have staged protests across germany against health care reforms which they say threaten their existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional pharmacy in germany reform plans include a clause in which pharmacists would be expected to negotiate rebates between insurance groups and pharmaceutical manufacturers .
should they fail , pharmacists would have to contribute 500 millions euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- from their own pockets to the government . abda maintains this is unfair since costs for insurance companies have risen not because pharmacists maintain high prices , but because 80 percent of what public health insurers pay for patients ' medications goes to pharmaceutical manufacturers and taxes . kai vogel believes it 's only a matter of time until germany changes its ways and starts allowing more competition .
for now , he suggests that when shopping in pharmacies , consumers should request drug prices and ask for less expensive generic varieties . they should also make sure they do n't get a headache on sunday . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de internet pharmacies not bringing expected savings although ordering prescriptions over the internet has been made legal in germany as part of the reform measures instituted to help the burdened public health system , the expected savings have n't materialized .

they might be invading your playground any day now the bavarian city of nuremberg is planning to open an exclusive playground for senior citizens .
are the elderly - and young people alike - in germany ready for this new chapter in the war between generations ? senior citizens are a highly misunderstood group of germans .
their sole purpose in life is not - despite what many people think - to shut down their young neighbor 's parties by calling the police , to grumble about dog poop in the streets , or throw hysterical fits if their train arrives five minutes behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trude unruh , the founding mother of gray panthers , is 81 senior citizens are also politically conscious and active people .
last year , a german activist group called gray panthers celebrated its 30th anniversary of fighting for senior rights .
in 1989 , the gray panthers even established a political wing - the grays - a party whose results usually appeared as an invisible condiment on the smallest slice of an election pie-chart marked " others . " but even the grays ' political invisibility seems to be becoming a thing of the past .
in the last municipal elections in berlin , the grays won the unprecedented 3.8 percent of the votes .
german seniors are coming .
with a vengeance . let 's play clever politicians know how to spot trends early .
that is why the bavarian city of nuremberg decided to jump on the bandwagon of senior renaissance and open a senior citizens ' playground , where grandmas and grandpas could get together to bowl , play chess or simply hang out with their peers .
if you 're under 60 : tough luck !
you 'll have to look for friends elsewhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do they have to be that loud ?
" it will be a place where the senior generation can find a refuge from younger people , " said deputy mayor horst förther , who is also in charge of sport activities in the city .
" we agreed that it was a good idea , given our demographic changes . " the project in nuremberg was inspired by research from the finnish university of lapland .
the experiments with what finnish researchers called " three-generational play " showed that senior citizens experienced significant improvements in balance , co-ordination and speed after only three months of " playing . " dangers ahead " i am considering a running track , a path for roller-skating , a soft badminton court and a trampoline , which is easy on the joints , " förther said .
" all activities can be carried out slowly so that the old people are n't pushed beyond their limits . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is munch 's " scream " about modernist angst or a child off a trampoline ?
parents who ever made the fatal mistake of purchasing a trampoline for their children - losing , as a consequence , the peace of their mind and the quiet of their garden - would beg to differ .
a trampoline may be easy on the joints , but it is known to produce an adrenaline rush in children on pair with bungee jumping off the chinese yangtze river tamer known as the three gorges dam .
it turns children into wild , uncontrollable , self-sustainable noise-machines .
it may have the same effect on senior citizens . " retired people need a space to be themselves without someone coming along and spilling ice-cream on their trousers or breakdancing , " said social worker andrea weber , who specializes in the lifestyle of the elderly . a cultural shift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no more playground sharing !
aside from the question whether ice-cream eating breakdancers have nothing better to do than throw scoops of chocolate-vanilla gelato at the local senior population , the german war of generations may take a turn for the bizarre . if , in early afternoon hours , playgrounds start filling with bouncing and screaming grandpas , those very same young people who had their party shut down the night before by their intolerant neighbors , may have to resort to calling the police to whine about the jumping geriatrics of germany ruining their alternative , hung-over , 4-pm breakfast . things could get really interesting . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 29.11.2006 nato decides to bolster troubled afghan force großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan remains at the top of nato 's priority list nato clinched an agreement wednesday to bolster its troubled mission in afghanistan by sending more troops and cutting restrictions on forces already there , while admitting that gaps remain . leaders of the 26-nation bloc , including us president george w. bush , also backed a french proposal to set up a " contact group " to coordinate action to prevent afghanistan slipping back toward chaos . closer to its traditional home ground , the leaders also agreed to admit serbia , montenegro and bosnia-herzegovina to its partnership for peace program , a decade after the wars that ripped the balkans apart . the pledge on afghanistan , announced at the end of a two-day summit in riga , came after the united states and britain in particular lobbied for more troops and fewer caveats on the forces in the violence-wracked country .
european heavyweight states like germany , france , spain and italy came under pressure to do more in southern afghanistan , where british-led troops have faced a growing death toll in fighting against taliban insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the chances for success in afghanistan had risen thanks to the summit chancellor angela merkel after the summit stressed that germany 's contribution to the afghanistan mission was highly valued by its nato partners .
she had also once more assured alliance members that germany would come to nato 's aid in emergencies beyond the locations where the bundeswehr is deployed . she added that solidarity demanded it and that it was clear " germany would n't close its eyes to this solidarity . " as an example , she suggested evacuating wounded soldiers from other nato states .
question of credibility nato took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in 2003 .
it currently comprises some 32,000 troops from 37 nations .
isaf has , however , faced increasingly fierce fighting since moving into the volatile south this year , and in september nato 's top commander us general james jones called for 2,500 extra military personnel . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the agreement on afghanistan . " everyone accepts this is nato 's absolutely critical mission , " he said .
" there is complete agreement around the table that nato 's credibility is ... on the line . " but he also admitted that shortfalls remained , with military chiefs saying that so far 85-90 percent of requirements were in place . " we have made significant progress but we still need to make those last remaining steps , " blair said . rapid reaction force nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer highlighted an agreement to deploy forces to help out in emergencies .
" in an emergency ... they will support each other , " he said .
" that is the most fundamental demonstration of nato 's solidarity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer the nato secretary general also confirmed that alliance leaders had supported french president jacques chirac 's proposal to establish an afghan " contact group . "
this could be along the lines of such a group set up for the balkans in the 1990s , comprising the united states , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , to coordinate diplomatic and other action to resolve the conflict . " i have been tasked ... to think about and to forward proposals on the possibility of a contact group for afghanistan , " de hoop scheffer added . overall , he said the nato summit was good news for the people of afghanistan , " the bottom line is that , five years after the fall of the taliban , afghanistan is making progress . "
" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself . " taking into account the importance of long-term stability in the western balkans and acknowledging the progress made so far ... we have invited these three countries to join partnership for peace , " said the nato declaration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was high for the summit and riga 's old town was almost deserted chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte criticized the invitation to the three states , her spokesman said after the summit .

aspirin is expensive and hard to buy in germany for decades , germany 's restrictive laws have limited the selling of medications only to pharmacies , which must be personally run by registered pharmacy owners . though european countries have been deregulating everything from telecommunications to postal services and railways , german lawmakers have been reluctant to tamper with the pill market , resulting in protection against competition among pharmacies and continued high prices . as of 2004 , however , pharmacists are now allowed to own not just one , but up to three of their own stores . risky business pharmacists generally support limited access to medication , saying that it ensures public safety .

european heavyweight states like germany , france , spain and italy came under pressure to do more in southern afghanistan , where british-led troops have faced a growing death toll in fighting against taliban insurgents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the chances for success in afghanistan had risen thanks to the summit chancellor angela merkel after the summit stressed that germany 's contribution to the afghanistan mission was highly valued by its nato partners .
she had also once more assured alliance members that germany would come to nato 's aid in emergencies beyond the locations where the bundeswehr is deployed . she added that solidarity demanded it and that it was clear " germany would n't close its eyes to this solidarity . " as an example , she suggested evacuating wounded soldiers from other nato states .
question of credibility nato took command of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan in 2003 .
it currently comprises some 32,000 troops from 37 nations .
isaf has , however , faced increasingly fierce fighting since moving into the volatile south this year , and in september nato 's top commander us general james jones called for 2,500 extra military personnel . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the agreement on afghanistan . " everyone accepts this is nato 's absolutely critical mission , " he said .
" there is complete agreement around the table that nato 's credibility is ... on the line . " but he also admitted that shortfalls remained , with military chiefs saying that so far 85-90 percent of requirements were in place . " we have made significant progress but we still need to make those last remaining steps , " blair said . rapid reaction force nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer highlighted an agreement to deploy forces to help out in emergencies .
" in an emergency ... they will support each other , " he said .
" that is the most fundamental demonstration of nato 's solidarity . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer the nato secretary general also confirmed that alliance leaders had supported french president jacques chirac 's proposal to establish an afghan " contact group . "
this could be along the lines of such a group set up for the balkans in the 1990s , comprising the united states , britain , france , germany , italy and russia , to coordinate diplomatic and other action to resolve the conflict . " i have been tasked ... to think about and to forward proposals on the possibility of a contact group for afghanistan , " de hoop scheffer added . overall , he said the nato summit was good news for the people of afghanistan , " the bottom line is that , five years after the fall of the taliban , afghanistan is making progress . "
" rewarded for lack of cooperation " while afghanistan is nato 's newest and most ambitious mission , there was also positive news on one of its older fronts , with the partnership for peace announcements for the three balkan states .
nato peacekeepers have spent more than a decade in region 's various countries , and the alliance is keen to point the way forward towards their eventual membership of the bloc itself . " taking into account the importance of long-term stability in the western balkans and acknowledging the progress made so far ... we have invited these three countries to join partnership for peace , " said the nato declaration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was high for the summit and riga 's old town was almost deserted chief un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte criticized the invitation to the three states , her spokesman said after the summit . " the prosecutor regrets this decision because it looks like a reward for the lack of cooperation ... with the office of the prosecutor , " the spokesman , anton nikiforov , told reporters . nato leaders also decided to invite new countries to join the alliance without naming any country best placed to become a member . " at our next summit in 2008 , the alliance intends to extend further invitations to those countries who meet nato 's performance-based standards and are able to contribute to euro-atlantic security and stability , " they said . also in riga , the nato chiefs declared " fully operational " the alliance 's flagship 25,000-strong nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- .
the force , to be staffed by nato countries on a six-month rotating basis , will stand ready to be deployed within five days for combat missions , evacuations or disaster relief operations lasting for up to a month . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " in afghanistan , damage limitation is the only realistic option " nato 's mission in afghanistan has n't been a failure , but it still could be , cambridge university political scientist christopher hill told dw-world.de. -lrb- 27.11.2006 -rrb- no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

a new eu report sheds some light germany and 10 other states knew about secret cia prisons in europe , and obstructed investigations into the case , the european parliament said in a report . there were 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe , a european parliament committee said in a draft report on tuesday . " many governments cooperated passively or actively -lrb- with the cia -rrb- , " the committee 's rapporteur claudio fava said .
" they knew . " the draft , which was based on classified documents and secret informants , noted at least at least 1,245 suspicious flights through european air space or stopovers at european airports that took place at the request of the cia . the report was the result of an investigation by a special committee of the european parliament into " extraordinary rendition " - the us practice of transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for questioning . extraordinary rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report took the eu 's javier solana to task human rights groups accuse the united states of having used extraordinary rendition in order to interrogate suspected terrorists under methods not allowed in the us itself , including torture . the german government has dismissed the report , which came out tuesday .
the eu committee also claimed austria , great britain , italy , poland , sweden , ireland , spain , portugal , greece and cyprus knew about the prisons . the report urged officials in the individual eu countries to start their own investigations as to whether their governments have broken european human rights accords with their use of extraordinary rendition . it also criticizes eu foreign policy chief javier solana and anti-terror coordinator gijs de vries , accusing them of having given incomplete statements to the investigating committee . failure to cooperate the report was especially critical of solana , expressing its " profound preoccupation " with the " omissions " and " denials " when the eu 's top diplomat appeared before the committee , in may . germany and spain were the only countries fava said adequately cooperated with eu committee 's investigation .
fava offered little in the way of conclusions , simply inviting the eu authorities to " accept their responsibilities " to deal with the offending member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri wants an apology from the cia meanwhile , a us appeals court in the state of virginia has agreed to hear the case of german-lebanese citizen khaled el-masri against ex-cia chief george tenet .
el-masri accused the cia of taking prison in afghanistan , where he was allegedly beaten , in a case of mistaken identity . el-masri is seeking damages of at least $ 75,000 -lrb- 57,142 euros -rrb- on allegations of unlawful capture , imprisonment , torture and other human rights violations .
a decision is expected next week , a spokesman for the richmond court said . in may , a lower us court had refused to hear the case that sparked a parliamentary investigation in germany , saying it would uncover state secrets and thus endanger the public . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators examine possibility of secret us prison in germany german federal prosecutors announced saturday that they are looking into claims of human rights violations stemming from the alleged detention of terror suspects at secret us prisons in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 29.11.2006 pill power : pharmacies battle over who sells meds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting the right advice about meds is essential , say pharmacists buying prescription and over-the-counter drugs is no easy task in germany .
only pharmacies run by certified pharmacy owners may sell medicinal drugs , but the meds monopoly has been getting a run for its money of late . got an excruciating headache ?
need an aspirin lickety-split ?
well , if you 're in germany and it 's a sunday , forget about grabbing a bottle of over-the-counter painkillers at the grocery store . not only are german grocery stores not open sundays , you wo n't find aspirin there anyway .
unless you have friends or neighbors with aspirin on hand , you 'll just have to wrestle with the hellish mindgrip unless you 're willing to shlep around town to find the emergency pharmacy on duty . limited access , high prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head ready to explode ?
aspirin is expensive and hard to buy in germany for decades , germany 's restrictive laws have limited the selling of medications only to pharmacies , which must be personally run by registered pharmacy owners . though european countries have been deregulating everything from telecommunications to postal services and railways , german lawmakers have been reluctant to tamper with the pill market , resulting in protection against competition among pharmacies and continued high prices . as of 2004 , however , pharmacists are now allowed to own not just one , but up to three of their own stores . risky business pharmacists generally support limited access to medication , saying that it ensures public safety . " even minor painkillers contain risks and should only be sold by pharmacists who provide information on them and who sell them only in limited amounts , " said ursula sellerberg , a spokeswoman for the federation of german pharmacists ' associations -lrb- abda -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where 's the sugar to make the medicine go down ?
still , " liberalization of who sells medication would mean greater competition and pharmacies would be forced to lower prices , " said kai vogel , a spokesman for the north rhine-westphalia consumer protection agency . vogel said german consumer protection agencies , however , are advocating that pharmacies should still be required to provide information about medication risk . sellerberg , for her part , pointed out that stomach problems from mere aspirin can occur when taken in high doses . " we 're encouraging pharmacists to advise even for ' lighter ' medications , " she added . gaining ground chain drug stores where consumers can buy inexpensive over-the-counter medication or prescription drugs provided by a trained pharmacist have been non-existent in germany .
there 's no riteaid , no cvs , no duane read - to name some of the us 's largest retailers . that has begun to change over the past few months .
in july , former software engineer ralf däinghaus opened a docmorris - europe 's largest mail-order medication firm based in the netherlands - pharmacy in saarbrücken .
thus ensued a debate over whether germany should permit retail drug chains . on the one hand , german pharmacists say docmorris was violating german law , which forbids corporations from owning pharmacies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris store in saarbrücken in august on the other hand , saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the dutch docmorris to open shop in saarbrücken , said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law . " penny-pinchers some customers in saarbrücken were delighted , saying they could save up to 30 percent on prescription and over-the counter drugs at docmorris .
and they 're not cheap at traditional pharmacies : there a package of 20 brand-name aspirin tablets costs just under five euros -lrb- around $ 6.50 -rrb- , though a generic version of 30 tablets costs around half that . ralph däinghaus was proud to announce double the number of sales in the first month of opening the saarbrücken store , as compared to sales by the former pharmacy store he took over there . he " expected success , " he told germany 's tageszeitung -lrb- taz -rrb- daily , because medication costs in germany are " scandalous " compared to france and belgium , where the same drugs cost half the price , taz wrote . german pharmacists were less than thrilled , however , and began worrying that their livelihoods were at stake and patients at risk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a " for apotheke or " pharmacy " däinghaus has also been in and out of court since july , with three saarbrücken pharmacists and two german pharmacy associations - who contested docmorris - eventually chalking up a victory when the saarland district court ordered the docmorris store in germany to be closed . " the decision was right based on german law , " said vogel , " but it is very likely that docmorris will go all the way to the european court of justice with countersuits and that the ban will be reversed and drug prices will eventually change in germany . " reform headaches in berlin , lawmakers plan to install a price cap on prescription drugs ; pharmacies could lower prices , but not raise them .
and , since only pharmacies are permitted to supply hospitals with drugs , politicians believe cheaper medication could also mean drastic savings in germany 's flailing public health care system . " but pharmacy costs make up only 2.7 percent of all the expenses of the public health care system , " said abda 's sellerberg .
" that 's only half of what the public insurance schemes need for their administrative tasks . " traditional pharmacists have been up-in-arms .
throughout november , thousands of them have staged protests across germany against health care reforms which they say threaten their existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a traditional pharmacy in germany reform plans include a clause in which pharmacists would be expected to negotiate rebates between insurance groups and pharmaceutical manufacturers .
should they fail , pharmacists would have to contribute 500 millions euros -lrb- $ 640 million -rrb- from their own pockets to the government . abda maintains this is unfair since costs for insurance companies have risen not because pharmacists maintain high prices , but because 80 percent of what public health insurers pay for patients ' medications goes to pharmaceutical manufacturers and taxes . kai vogel believes it 's only a matter of time until germany changes its ways and starts allowing more competition .
for now , he suggests that when shopping in pharmacies , consumers should request drug prices and ask for less expensive generic varieties . they should also make sure they do n't get a headache on sunday . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de internet pharmacies not bringing expected savings although ordering prescriptions over the internet has been made legal in germany as part of the reform measures instituted to help the burdened public health system , the expected savings have n't materialized .

a new eu report sheds some light germany and 10 other states knew about secret cia prisons in europe , and obstructed investigations into the case , the european parliament said in a report . there were 11 european countries that knew about secret us jails for terror suspects and obstructed the investigation into the transport and illegal detention of prisoners within europe , a european parliament committee said in a draft report on tuesday . " many governments cooperated passively or actively -lrb- with the cia -rrb- , " the committee 's rapporteur claudio fava said .
" they knew . " the draft , which was based on classified documents and secret informants , noted at least at least 1,245 suspicious flights through european air space or stopovers at european airports that took place at the request of the cia . the report was the result of an investigation by a special committee of the european parliament into " extraordinary rendition " - the us practice of transporting terrorist suspects to third countries for questioning . extraordinary rendition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report took the eu 's javier solana to task human rights groups accuse the united states of having used extraordinary rendition in order to interrogate suspected terrorists under methods not allowed in the us itself , including torture . the german government has dismissed the report , which came out tuesday .
the eu committee also claimed austria , great britain , italy , poland , sweden , ireland , spain , portugal , greece and cyprus knew about the prisons . the report urged officials in the individual eu countries to start their own investigations as to whether their governments have broken european human rights accords with their use of extraordinary rendition . it also criticizes eu foreign policy chief javier solana and anti-terror coordinator gijs de vries , accusing them of having given incomplete statements to the investigating committee . failure to cooperate the report was especially critical of solana , expressing its " profound preoccupation " with the " omissions " and " denials " when the eu 's top diplomat appeared before the committee , in may . germany and spain were the only countries fava said adequately cooperated with eu committee 's investigation .
fava offered little in the way of conclusions , simply inviting the eu authorities to " accept their responsibilities " to deal with the offending member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khaled el-masri wants an apology from the cia meanwhile , a us appeals court in the state of virginia has agreed to hear the case of german-lebanese citizen khaled el-masri against ex-cia chief george tenet .

asked if the veils should be prohibited in airports and at passport control , six out of 10 agreed .
icm surveyed 1,004 people for the bbc .
muslim groups say the figures may reflect public unease because of how the media has presented the veil .
in october leader of the commons jack straw said he asked female constituents to remove their veils for interviews .
this sparked a national debate .
in the survey , a nationally representative sample of people were asked whether they would approve of the government banning muslim women from wearing veils which cover their faces in public places .

muslim groups say the figures may reflect public unease because of how the media has presented the veil .
in october leader of the commons jack straw said he asked female constituents to remove their veils for interviews .
this sparked a national debate .
in the survey , a nationally representative sample of people were asked whether they would approve of the government banning muslim women from wearing veils which cover their faces in public places .
some 33 % of respondents said they would approve of a ban and 56 % said they would not .
just under one in 10 said they did not know .
asked if they would support prohibition in specific circumstances , 61 % said they would approve a ban in airports and at passport control , 53 % in courtrooms and 53 % in schools .
educating the public some 41 % said they would support a workplace ban - but 56 % said they would oppose such a move for public transport .
have your say " why should we be worried about what people wear when they are out in their own time ? "
ryan , swansea send us your comments rajnaara akhtar , of the assembly for the protection of the hijab , said the findings were " positive " because it showed " the vast majority of people ... believe women should be allowed to wear what they like " .
she told bbc radio 4 's today programme that there was a common misconception that muslim women who wore the face-covering veil had been forced to do so , whereas in reality this was true for only a " tiny , tiny minority " .
" what we , as muslims , need to do is to ensure were are educating people on it and making sure that people do understand it is a choice , " she said .
' common sense ' approach " we are living in britain , which is a democratic society and the vast majority of people in this country promote that and respect that completely . "
and british muslim forum chief executive zareen roohi ahmed said she was not surprised by the figures given media hype over the veil .
" at the end of the day this is an item of cloth .
we need to be taking a common sense view , " said ms ahmed .
" if security is at stake , such as at an airport , then yes , of course , the veil should be removed .
" if it proves difficult in performing a task such as in a school , then it is up to the individual who is wearing the veil whether they want to work there or not . "
ms ahmed said she welcomed debate over the veil because it had the potential to break down barriers between muslims and other people .
but at the same time that debate had become harder , including within muslim communities , because some parts of the media had blown the issue out of proportion , she said .
international issue in the uk , jack straw sparked the debate after writing an article in his constituency 's newspaper saying he had asked muslim women attending his mp surgeries to remove the veil .
mr straw said that while he believed it was an individual 's right to choose how they follow their faith , he believed they should also consider how others in turn may react .
last week , a muslim classroom assistant suspended by a school in west yorkshire for wearing a veil in lessons was sacked .
politicians in italy have called for a ban on face-covering veils in public places while dutch ministers have said they will legislate against the all-over burqa .
vote should the veil be banned ?
yes , totally only in banks , courts , etc .

he was taken to hospital , where part of one of his legs was later amputated .
he said instinct kept him alive and gave him the strength to use a mobile phone to call for medical aid .

it later emerged that fellow landmines expert damir paradzik , a bosnian , had also suffered serious injuries .

shelter says 1.6 million youngsters in britain are living in housing judged to be temporary , overcrowded or unfit .
the charity , which is marking its 40th anniversary , described the situation as a " scandal " .
shelter was set up after bbc drama- documentary cathy come home was screened , an anniversary being marked by the no home season of programming .
in its report , against the odds , shelter analyses existing government statistics and calls on chancellor gordon brown to provide the funding to build more " vital " social housing .
' fair start ' shelter chief executive adam sampson said : " it 's a scandal that 40 years after the plight of cathy come home 's on-screen family shocked the nation , the lives of 1.6 million children are today being devastated by the grim reality of homelessness and bad housing . "
there are still thousands of individuals who slip through the cracks every year " jenny edwards , chief executive of homeless link , lack of sympathy for homeless system ' failing homeless women ' " it 's vital that the chancellor commits to funding 20,000 extra social homes each year to give these children a fair start in life . "
shelter said living in poor housing had a significantly detrimental impact on children 's lives .

looking at future projections , it added : " different modelling approaches project different scales of change but indicate that wind strength and wave heights will increase . "
each of the contributing scientists rated their level of certainty about the statements within the report , as low , medium or high , based on the amount and consistency of available data .
it gave a low confidence rating to the impact of climate change on the distribution of fish species because it said that observations of rare fish migrants to uk water can not yet be directly attributed to global warming .
it also added that although cold-water species had moved further north in some regions , such as the north sea , the shifts had not happened elsewhere .

the small free-floating organisms form the basis of the food web in the sea , so the availability of plankton has a major influence on the distribution of fish stocks and animals further up the food chain , such as sea birds .

projection of sea levels around the uk 's shores rising up to 80cm by 2080 received a " medium " confidence rating , yet forecasts of increased coastal flooding merited a " low " confidence rating , illustrating the complexities of modelling the impacts of climate change on the seas around the uk .

" there is a lot we still do not understand about the impact climate change will have on our oceans , but the report card gives us at-a-glance the latest scientific knowledge which will improve our understanding and our capacity to act , " he added .

the musician , on an australian tour , was asked if he had a message for howard , whose government overruled a local law allowing gay unions in june .
" up yours ! " replied the outspoken star , who " married " his partner david furnish in a civil ceremony last year .
the issue of gay marriage has been high on the political agenda in australia in recent months .
the australian capital territory - the area around canberra - became the first part of the country to legally recognise gay relationships when it voted on the issue in may this year .
but many members of mr howard 's conservative government opposed the change , and the law was invalidated .
' not homophobic ' attorney general philip ruddock said that federal law clearly defined marriage as being only between a man and a woman .
mr howard denied the move was homophobic , adding that it was a question of preserving marriage as an institution with " special character " .
" if you look at the legislation , what it effectively says , a civil union is not a marriage , but it will be treated for all purposes as being equivalent to a marriage , " he said .
sir elton has long been an advocate of gay rights , and caused an outcry earlier this month when he called for organised religion to be banned , and accused it of trying to " turn hatred towards gay people " .
organised religion lacked compassion and turned people into " hateful lemmings " , he told the observer music monthly magazine .
but the musician said he loved the idea of the teachings of jesus christ and said there were many gays he knew who loved their religion .
he added he would continue to fight for gay rights , " whether i do it silently behind the scenes or so vocally that i get locked up " .
sir elton and mr furnish formalised their relationship in a civil partnership in december last year .
they were granted new rights in areas such as employment , pension and inheritance , but such partnerships are not officially regarded as marriages under uk law .

the musician , on an australian tour , was asked if he had a message for howard , whose government overruled a local law allowing gay unions in june .
" up yours ! " replied the outspoken star , who " married " his partner david furnish in a civil ceremony last year .
the issue of gay marriage has been high on the political agenda in australia in recent months .
the australian capital territory - the area around canberra - became the first part of the country to legally recognise gay relationships when it voted on the issue in may this year .
but many members of mr howard 's conservative government opposed the change , and the law was invalidated .
' not homophobic ' attorney general philip ruddock said that federal law clearly defined marriage as being only between a man and a woman .
mr howard denied the move was homophobic , adding that it was a question of preserving marriage as an institution with " special character " .
" if you look at the legislation , what it effectively says , a civil union is not a marriage , but it will be treated for all purposes as being equivalent to a marriage , " he said .
sir elton has long been an advocate of gay rights , and caused an outcry earlier this month when he called for organised religion to be banned , and accused it of trying to " turn hatred towards gay people " .
organised religion lacked compassion and turned people into " hateful lemmings " , he told the observer music monthly magazine .
but the musician said he loved the idea of the teachings of jesus christ and said there were many gays he knew who loved their religion .
he added he would continue to fight for gay rights , " whether i do it silently behind the scenes or so vocally that i get locked up " .
sir elton and mr furnish formalised their relationship in a civil partnership in december last year .

getting too hooked on a daily bacon sandwich may increase the risk of bladder cancer , research suggests .
harvard scientists found people who ate bacon at least five times a week were 59 % more likely to develop the disease than those who never did .
they also found people who frequently ate skinless chicken had a 52 % greater risk .
chemicals called nitrosamines and heterocyclic amines may be to blame .
the study appears in the american journal of clinical nutrition .
the link between diet and cancer is complex and difficult to unravel dr emma knight the harvard team studied data on nearly 136,000 people .
the participants were followed for up to 22 years , during which time 808 developed bladder cancer .
nitrosamines , chemicals which are often found in processed meats and in particularly high levels in bacon , are known to be carcinogenic in high quantities .
heterocyclic amines , also known carcinogens , form when meat is cooked at high temperatures .
compared with skinless chicken , cooked chicken with skin is known to contain a smaller amount of heterocyclic amines .
more work needed however , the research is far from definitive .
the researchers also found people who ate bacon and other processed meats frequently were also more likely to smoke and to take in more fat and fewer vitamins .
they were also less likely to exercise .
dr emma knight , science information manager at cancer research uk , said : " the link between diet and cancer is complex and difficult to unravel but we know that eating lots of red and processed meat can increase our risk of some types of cancer .
" more research is needed before we can say for sure whether or not eating bacon in particular affects bladder cancer risk .
" for now , our advice remains to eat a balanced diet that is low in fat , processed and red meat , and rich in vegetables , fruit and fibre . "
more than 10,000 people a year are diagnosed with bladder cancer in the uk .

getting too hooked on a daily bacon sandwich may increase the risk of bladder cancer , research suggests .
harvard scientists found people who ate bacon at least five times a week were 59 % more likely to develop the disease than those who never did .
they also found people who frequently ate skinless chicken had a 52 % greater risk .
chemicals called nitrosamines and heterocyclic amines may be to blame .
the study appears in the american journal of clinical nutrition .
the link between diet and cancer is complex and difficult to unravel dr emma knight the harvard team studied data on nearly 136,000 people .
the participants were followed for up to 22 years , during which time 808 developed bladder cancer .
nitrosamines , chemicals which are often found in processed meats and in particularly high levels in bacon , are known to be carcinogenic in high quantities .
heterocyclic amines , also known carcinogens , form when meat is cooked at high temperatures .
compared with skinless chicken , cooked chicken with skin is known to contain a smaller amount of heterocyclic amines .
more work needed however , the research is far from definitive .
the researchers also found people who ate bacon and other processed meats frequently were also more likely to smoke and to take in more fat and fewer vitamins .
they were also less likely to exercise .
dr emma knight , science information manager at cancer research uk , said : " the link between diet and cancer is complex and difficult to unravel but we know that eating lots of red and processed meat can increase our risk of some types of cancer .
" more research is needed before we can say for sure whether or not eating bacon in particular affects bladder cancer risk .
" for now , our advice remains to eat a balanced diet that is low in fat , processed and red meat , and rich in vegetables , fruit and fibre . "

central to the bill are proposals to raise the state pension age to 68 by 2050 and to restore the link between earnings and the basic state pension .
ministers , who say they hope to restore the link by 2012 , have set out a timetable for a package of changes .
the package will also cut the number of years it takes to build a full basic pension for men and women to 30 .
today 's bill is an important step towards ending the scandalous inequalities currently faced by women in retirement john hutton , work and pensions secretary pensions secretary john hutton set out the government 's proposals - already revealed earlier this month in the queen 's speech - at a press conference in london .
longer lives the bill is the product of several years of public consultation and debate , and includes most of the main recommendations of lord turner 's pension commission which reported last year .
the main proposals are : link increases in the basic state pension to earnings during the next parliament raise the state pension age to 66 between 2024-2026 , to 67 between 2034-2036 , and to 68 between 2044-2046 reduce the number of years it takes to build a full basic state pension from 44 years for men and 39 for women to 30 years for everyone create a new delivery authority to " bring on board the expertise needed to design a personal accounts system " mr hutton said last month that the pension age would have to rise to ensure the pension system remained affordable as people live longer .
he also said major reform was needed to avoid shifting the tax burden onto younger generations .
women should be significant beneficiaries of the changes .
mr hutton said that reducing the number of years it takes for people to qualify for a full state pension would " transform the pension situation for millions of women " .
at present , about 30 % of women pay enough national insurance contributions to qualify for a full state pension , mainly because they take time out of the work to look after children and relatives .
the government said it hoped that by 2025 , up to nine out of 10 women would qualify for a full state pension .
as a result , the average women 's state pension would rise from £ 77 a week to £ 130 .
" today 's bill is an important step towards ending the scandalous inequalities currently faced by women in retirement , " mr hutton said .
this bill is very good news for future pensioners but short-changes today 's gordon lishman , age concern shortcomings there has been criticism that the reforms fail today 's pensioners .
opposition parties have accused the government of seeking to compel people to work longer without ensuring they receive a decent pension on their retirement .
likewise , pressure groups , while welcoming the greater help for women and restoration of the earnings link , said that the bill had some shortcomings , particularly as there is a time-lag for many of the changes .
" this bill is very good news for future pensioners but short-changes today 's , " said gordon lishman , director general of age concern .
" if the state pension age must rise to fund a better state pension , there has to be a significant transformation in the workplace to enable older people to continue to work if they want or need to .
" mandatory retirement ages must be scrapped and targeted programmes must be put in place to support those who need training and those who can not work , " mr lishman added .
