" i am still hoping for some kind of clarification , " he told deutsche welle .
" i want to know why they did what they did to me , and that is why we brought the whole affair into the public domain .
no charges were brought against me in either afghanistan or skopje . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skopje , where el masri says he was first detained el masri said he was held in a hotel in the macedonian capital , skopje , and - after 23 days of imprisonment and interrogation there - was unknowingly taken to afghanistan . " at skopje airport i was told to go into a room where i would receive a medical examination , " he said .
" once inside , they blindfolded me and put me in handcuffs .
i was hit all over and then my clothes were torn from my body by sharp objects until i was standing there naked .
they humiliated me . then they tied me up , like in the pictures we know from guantanamo .
i was taken to a plane , thrown on the floor and given two shots of sedatives . " " i feared for my life " he goes on to explain that he did n't even know where he was until a fellow prisoner told him .
it was afghanistan .
during an interrogation , el masri deduced from his disguised interrogator 's perfect command of english , that he must be a cia agent . the german detainee was told he was in a place where there were no laws , and that nobody knew of his whereabouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-cultural centre in neu-ulm " the whole time i was in afghanistan i feared for my life , " he said .
" it was terrible for me . " el masri said he believes it was his connections to islamic centers in his hometown of neu-ulm and neighboring ulm which led to his abduction .
both places are considered centers of islamic activity and have been on the radar of the bavarian office for the protection of the constitution for some time . mistaken identity ? he said his interrogator had access to detailed information about his life , which his lawyer has since confirmed could only come from the german intelligence services .
were that the case , it would invalidate the theory that el masri had been mistaken for an al qaeda member of the same name .
the german government has refused to comment on a possible cooperation between its own intelligence authorities and the cia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister , otto schily " in afghanistan , i was asked what i would do on my release , whether i would go to the german authorities or the german press , " el masri said . " i was told i was clever enough to know better .
i knew then that they were threatening me , so when i got back , i recorded everything on video in case anything should happen to me .
then i called a lawyer and the press . "
the case only made it into the public sphere last year , by which time el masri had been released . the then governing coalition of social democrats and greens already knew of the incident .
former us ambassador dan coats had informed then interior minister otto schily about the abduction , but it was el masri 's lawyer who reported it to former foreign minister joschka fischer and his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , who was then the chancellery 's chief of staff .
exactly what the government did with that information in order to clarify the case remains a mystery . german chancellor angela merkel has said that the case will be take up by a parliamentary committee . mirjam gehrke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the united states for some of its tactics in the fight against terrorism and called for the guantanamo bay detention center to be closed in an interview published saturday .

" i am still hoping for some kind of clarification , " he told deutsche welle .
" i want to know why they did what they did to me , and that is why we brought the whole affair into the public domain .
no charges were brought against me in either afghanistan or skopje .

" once inside , they blindfolded me and put me in handcuffs .

the case only made it into the public sphere last year , by which time el masri had been released . the then governing coalition of social democrats and greens already knew of the incident .
former us ambassador dan coats had informed then interior minister otto schily about the abduction , but it was el masri 's lawyer who reported it to former foreign minister joschka fischer and his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , who was then the chancellery 's chief of staff .

the comments appeared to flatly contradict previous reported remarks by the bank 's president .

the comments appeared to flatly contradict previous reported remarks by the bank 's president . " at the moment , iran does not have any schedule to transfer its foreign exchange accounts to the named countries , " mohammad-jafar mojarad told the state news agency irna when asked if iran has transferred the accounts to asia . conflicting statements the head of the central bank , ebrahim sheibani , had reportedly said on wednesday that iran was moving funds from europe elsewhere after western demands to freeze iranian assets as a result of the conflict over iran 's decision to resume nuclear research . the international crisis over iran 's nuclear program escalated when the islamic republic resumed sensitive uranium enrichment research on jan .
10 , despite calls by european negotiators to maintain a halt to such activities . " we transfer foreign currency reserves related to all sectors including oil foreign exchanges to wherever it is good for us and we have started this transfer , " sheibani was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at an oil refinery in tehran iran is expected to earn at least $ 40 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- from oil production this year .
in the past , iran has deposited its oil revenues in european banks . sheibani himself , however , on saturday rejected the idea that such transfers had already taken place , even though he left the door open for such a possibility in the future . " we will transfer iran 's foreign accounts whenever we believe it is necessary , " sheibani told state television . us : transfer a sign of growing isolation the united states said on friday that any iranian move to transfer currency deposits away from europe would be a sign of growing isolation .
us state department spokesman sean mccormack said such market maneuvers would not deter moves to refer its nuclear activities to the un security council . " i think it is an indication that iran is further isolating itself from the rest of the world , " mccormack told a press briefing .
" i do n't know what it is that they hope to accomplish by doing this . " london , paris and berlin called an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency for feb .
2 as western countries aim to gather support for referring iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . admadinejad calls for sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad meanwhile called on islamic states to use their economic power against the west . " along with the political war , there 's an big , hidden economic war going on and islamic states should use their potential to cut off the hands of the enemy , " he said . according to news reports , iranian leaders have also threatened that the nuclear stand-off might provoke an oil crisis . willing to compromise ? but despite the rhetoric , tehran seems willing to work out a diplomatic compromise behind the scenes . citing high-ranking government sources , german magazin der spiegel reported saturday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier received a message from the iranian government , saying that iran would be willing to negotiate a joint venture uranium enrichment program with russia and china . russia had suggested establishing such a program outside iran to alleviate western fears of iran using the technology to build nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : no ace out of chirac 's sleeve the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .

" i am still hoping for some kind of clarification , " he told deutsche welle .
" i want to know why they did what they did to me , and that is why we brought the whole affair into the public domain .
no charges were brought against me in either afghanistan or skopje . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skopje , where el masri says he was first detained el masri said he was held in a hotel in the macedonian capital , skopje , and - after 23 days of imprisonment and interrogation there - was unknowingly taken to afghanistan . " at skopje airport i was told to go into a room where i would receive a medical examination , " he said .
" once inside , they blindfolded me and put me in handcuffs .
i was hit all over and then my clothes were torn from my body by sharp objects until i was standing there naked .
they humiliated me . then they tied me up , like in the pictures we know from guantanamo .
i was taken to a plane , thrown on the floor and given two shots of sedatives . " " i feared for my life " he goes on to explain that he did n't even know where he was until a fellow prisoner told him .
it was afghanistan .
during an interrogation , el masri deduced from his disguised interrogator 's perfect command of english , that he must be a cia agent . the german detainee was told he was in a place where there were no laws , and that nobody knew of his whereabouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-cultural centre in neu-ulm " the whole time i was in afghanistan i feared for my life , " he said .
" it was terrible for me . " el masri said he believes it was his connections to islamic centers in his hometown of neu-ulm and neighboring ulm which led to his abduction .
both places are considered centers of islamic activity and have been on the radar of the bavarian office for the protection of the constitution for some time . mistaken identity ? he said his interrogator had access to detailed information about his life , which his lawyer has since confirmed could only come from the german intelligence services .
were that the case , it would invalidate the theory that el masri had been mistaken for an al qaeda member of the same name .
the german government has refused to comment on a possible cooperation between its own intelligence authorities and the cia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister , otto schily " in afghanistan , i was asked what i would do on my release , whether i would go to the german authorities or the german press , " el masri said . " i was told i was clever enough to know better .
i knew then that they were threatening me , so when i got back , i recorded everything on video in case anything should happen to me .
then i called a lawyer and the press . "
the case only made it into the public sphere last year , by which time el masri had been released . the then governing coalition of social democrats and greens already knew of the incident .
former us ambassador dan coats had informed then interior minister otto schily about the abduction , but it was el masri 's lawyer who reported it to former foreign minister joschka fischer and his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , who was then the chancellery 's chief of staff .
exactly what the government did with that information in order to clarify the case remains a mystery . german chancellor angela merkel has said that the case will be take up by a parliamentary committee . mirjam gehrke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the united states for some of its tactics in the fight against terrorism and called for the guantanamo bay detention center to be closed in an interview published saturday .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skopje , where el masri says he was first detained el masri said he was held in a hotel in the macedonian capital , skopje , and - after 23 days of imprisonment and interrogation there - was unknowingly taken to afghanistan . " at skopje airport i was told to go into a room where i would receive a medical examination , " he said .
" once inside , they blindfolded me and put me in handcuffs .
i was hit all over and then my clothes were torn from my body by sharp objects until i was standing there naked .
they humiliated me . then they tied me up , like in the pictures we know from guantanamo .
i was taken to a plane , thrown on the floor and given two shots of sedatives . " " i feared for my life " he goes on to explain that he did n't even know where he was until a fellow prisoner told him .
it was afghanistan .
during an interrogation , el masri deduced from his disguised interrogator 's perfect command of english , that he must be a cia agent . the german detainee was told he was in a place where there were no laws , and that nobody knew of his whereabouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-cultural centre in neu-ulm " the whole time i was in afghanistan i feared for my life , " he said .
" it was terrible for me . " el masri said he believes it was his connections to islamic centers in his hometown of neu-ulm and neighboring ulm which led to his abduction .
both places are considered centers of islamic activity and have been on the radar of the bavarian office for the protection of the constitution for some time . mistaken identity ? he said his interrogator had access to detailed information about his life , which his lawyer has since confirmed could only come from the german intelligence services .
were that the case , it would invalidate the theory that el masri had been mistaken for an al qaeda member of the same name .
the german government has refused to comment on a possible cooperation between its own intelligence authorities and the cia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister , otto schily " in afghanistan , i was asked what i would do on my release , whether i would go to the german authorities or the german press , " el masri said . " i was told i was clever enough to know better .
i knew then that they were threatening me , so when i got back , i recorded everything on video in case anything should happen to me .
then i called a lawyer and the press . "
the case only made it into the public sphere last year , by which time el masri had been released . the then governing coalition of social democrats and greens already knew of the incident .
former us ambassador dan coats had informed then interior minister otto schily about the abduction , but it was el masri 's lawyer who reported it to former foreign minister joschka fischer and his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , who was then the chancellery 's chief of staff .
exactly what the government did with that information in order to clarify the case remains a mystery . german chancellor angela merkel has said that the case will be take up by a parliamentary committee . mirjam gehrke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the united states for some of its tactics in the fight against terrorism and called for the guantanamo bay detention center to be closed in an interview published saturday .

i was hit all over and then my clothes were torn from my body by sharp objects until i was standing there naked .
they humiliated me . then they tied me up , like in the pictures we know from guantanamo .
i was taken to a plane , thrown on the floor and given two shots of sedatives . " " i feared for my life " he goes on to explain that he did n't even know where he was until a fellow prisoner told him .
it was afghanistan .
during an interrogation , el masri deduced from his disguised interrogator 's perfect command of english , that he must be a cia agent . the german detainee was told he was in a place where there were no laws , and that nobody knew of his whereabouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-cultural centre in neu-ulm " the whole time i was in afghanistan i feared for my life , " he said .
" it was terrible for me . " el masri said he believes it was his connections to islamic centers in his hometown of neu-ulm and neighboring ulm which led to his abduction .
both places are considered centers of islamic activity and have been on the radar of the bavarian office for the protection of the constitution for some time . mistaken identity ? he said his interrogator had access to detailed information about his life , which his lawyer has since confirmed could only come from the german intelligence services .
were that the case , it would invalidate the theory that el masri had been mistaken for an al qaeda member of the same name .
the german government has refused to comment on a possible cooperation between its own intelligence authorities and the cia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister , otto schily " in afghanistan , i was asked what i would do on my release , whether i would go to the german authorities or the german press , " el masri said . " i was told i was clever enough to know better .
i knew then that they were threatening me , so when i got back , i recorded everything on video in case anything should happen to me .
then i called a lawyer and the press . "
the case only made it into the public sphere last year , by which time el masri had been released . the then governing coalition of social democrats and greens already knew of the incident .
former us ambassador dan coats had informed then interior minister otto schily about the abduction , but it was el masri 's lawyer who reported it to former foreign minister joschka fischer and his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , who was then the chancellery 's chief of staff .
exactly what the government did with that information in order to clarify the case remains a mystery . german chancellor angela merkel has said that the case will be take up by a parliamentary committee . mirjam gehrke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the united states for some of its tactics in the fight against terrorism and called for the guantanamo bay detention center to be closed in an interview published saturday .

the comments appeared to flatly contradict previous reported remarks by the bank 's president . " at the moment , iran does not have any schedule to transfer its foreign exchange accounts to the named countries , " mohammad-jafar mojarad told the state news agency irna when asked if iran has transferred the accounts to asia . conflicting statements the head of the central bank , ebrahim sheibani , had reportedly said on wednesday that iran was moving funds from europe elsewhere after western demands to freeze iranian assets as a result of the conflict over iran 's decision to resume nuclear research . the international crisis over iran 's nuclear program escalated when the islamic republic resumed sensitive uranium enrichment research on jan .
10 , despite calls by european negotiators to maintain a halt to such activities . " we transfer foreign currency reserves related to all sectors including oil foreign exchanges to wherever it is good for us and we have started this transfer , " sheibani was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at an oil refinery in tehran iran is expected to earn at least $ 40 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- from oil production this year .
in the past , iran has deposited its oil revenues in european banks . sheibani himself , however , on saturday rejected the idea that such transfers had already taken place , even though he left the door open for such a possibility in the future . " we will transfer iran 's foreign accounts whenever we believe it is necessary , " sheibani told state television . us : transfer a sign of growing isolation the united states said on friday that any iranian move to transfer currency deposits away from europe would be a sign of growing isolation .
us state department spokesman sean mccormack said such market maneuvers would not deter moves to refer its nuclear activities to the un security council . " i think it is an indication that iran is further isolating itself from the rest of the world , " mccormack told a press briefing .
" i do n't know what it is that they hope to accomplish by doing this . " london , paris and berlin called an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency for feb .
2 as western countries aim to gather support for referring iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . admadinejad calls for sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad meanwhile called on islamic states to use their economic power against the west . " along with the political war , there 's an big , hidden economic war going on and islamic states should use their potential to cut off the hands of the enemy , " he said . according to news reports , iranian leaders have also threatened that the nuclear stand-off might provoke an oil crisis . willing to compromise ? but despite the rhetoric , tehran seems willing to work out a diplomatic compromise behind the scenes . citing high-ranking government sources , german magazin der spiegel reported saturday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier received a message from the iranian government , saying that iran would be willing to negotiate a joint venture uranium enrichment program with russia and china . russia had suggested establishing such a program outside iran to alleviate western fears of iran using the technology to build nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : no ace out of chirac 's sleeve the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .

world cup organizers , however , call the reporting irresponsible and are demanding a correction and apology from the magazine . dw-world : do you think the oc 's public calls for an apology from stiftung warentest are a good idea ? theo zwanziger : yes , it is urgently needed .
if i spread nonsense , i have to be ready to back off .
i can not give a red card to stadiums that among the best in the world .
what does giving a red card mean ?
the red card is expulsion from the competition .
it -lrb- the magazine -rrb- has strikingly entered the scene in a way that hurts the german world cup efforts and our country . do you think that stiftung warentest is going to back pedal ? i do n't know , and it does n't matter to me .
but we have to demand it .
we are not opposed to information , help or advice . bildunterschrift : testers said kaiserslautern 's renovated stadium was unsafe in the case of mass panic the press has started saying the oc whining , is this debate helping germany 's image before the world cup ? this has absolutely nothing to do with whining .
we owe the stadium operators a degree of protection .
they went to great efforts and spent a large amount of tax money , such as in kaiserslautern , to build a great stadium .
we are not going to let anyone say it deserves a red card . moving to the cancelled opening event fifa had planned for berlin .
was the problem really with the grass ? you can not underestimate that a world cup pitch for this kind of tournament is a little different than a field near a club team somewhere .
it is completely different .
not just the way it 's used , but even the television broadcasts and a number of other things make it a very different entity .
fundamentally , it is where the world cup happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers said the gala was cancelled to protect the pitch the dutch turf laying company is saying it could replace the turf in 17 hours without a problem . we 've had these experiences before .
turf laying companies and manufactures always say that .
but we have to guarantee success under even extremely harsh weather conditions .
they do n't know what kind of weather we 're going to have when the tournament comes around . but a trimmed down version of the show is going to take place in munich , where players will take the field a few hours later . the two events have absolutely nothing to do with each other .
absolutely nothing . so no one is going to go on the field in munich ? it will be covered .
there will not be any demands made of the turf in munich as was planned for the gala in berlin . the incidents with stiftung warentest and the berlin gala cancellation have tarnished the image of the 2006 world cup .
how do you see the current mood in germany ? it is possible to clear up a tarnished image .
that is why i do n't think the image in germany has been tarnished .
once the first match has started , we 'll see the same excitement we experienced during the confederations cup in an even greater form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger is upset about damage done to the world cup 's reputation and outside of germany ? outside of germany the safety of our stadiums has been irresponsibly discredited , and that is why i am so upset about what stiftung warentest has done .
people in england , austria , switzerland and holland are rubbing their hands with glee and pointing to stiftung warentest .
but that is something stiftung warentest has to work out with them . marcus bösch interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interior ministry urges calm over world cup stadium report a german parliamentarian has said there is " no cause for panic or hysteria " in response to the consumer group stiftung warentest ’ s safety assessment of the country ’ s world cup stadiums .

19 , 2006 -rrb- world cup gala gets the ax the star-studded gala which was to open the 2006 world cup in berlin has been cancelled due to concerns over damage to the olympic stadium 's pitch .

" the loss of president rugova comes at a particularly challenging time , " solana said in a statement .
" his wisdom and authority will be greatly missed .
at this difficult moment i call on all leaders of kosovo to show unity and responsibility . " rugova , who became president in march 2002 , died saturday of lung cancer , aged 61 , only days ahead of the start of talks wednesday in vienna on the final status of the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops in the eastern kosovo town of vitina in 2001 while the ethnic albanians , representing 90 percent of the population , are demanding independence , belgrade is only offering broad autonomy for kosovo .
the province has been run by the un and nato since june 1999 when the alliance 's air strikes led serbian forces under then serbian leader slobodan milosevic to withdraw from the province . the talks have now been postponed until february , un officials said . but un secretary general kofi annan said he believed rugova 's death " will not disrupt this process . " french president jacques chirac urged kosovo 's representatives to continue the negotiations in rugova 's " spirit of realism , tolerance and dialogue .

" the loss of president rugova comes at a particularly challenging time , " solana said in a statement .
" his wisdom and authority will be greatly missed .
at this difficult moment i call on all leaders of kosovo to show unity and responsibility . " rugova , who became president in march 2002 , died saturday of lung cancer , aged 61 , only days ahead of the start of talks wednesday in vienna on the final status of the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops in the eastern kosovo town of vitina in 2001 while the ethnic albanians , representing 90 percent of the population , are demanding independence , belgrade is only offering broad autonomy for kosovo .
the province has been run by the un and nato since june 1999 when the alliance 's air strikes led serbian forces under then serbian leader slobodan milosevic to withdraw from the province . the talks have now been postponed until february , un officials said . but un secretary general kofi annan said he believed rugova 's death " will not disrupt this process . " french president jacques chirac urged kosovo 's representatives to continue the negotiations in rugova 's " spirit of realism , tolerance and dialogue . " german chancellor angela merkel said rugova 's commitment to nonviolence and democracy should be " a legacy for all those who carry political responsibility in kosovo . " rugova crucial to peace talks the leadership of the charismatic kosovo leader , who was called the " gandhi of the balkan , " was considered crucial for the un-mediated negotiations . " with him kosovo has lost a historic leader who devoted his life to protecting and promoting the rights of the people of kosovo , " solana said .
" president rugova was a man of peace , firm in the face of oppression , but deeply committed to the ideals of non-violence . " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , also paid tribute to rugova , saying in a statement that it " appreciated his work for a peaceful solution to the problems of kosovo , and encourages all leaders to continue to work in this spirit . " a " tragic moment " for kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari the united nations chief mediator in kosovo , martti ahtisaari , meanwhile offered his " deepest condolences " to rugova 's family and also called for " calm " and continued negotiations in the province . " i 'm certain that president rugova would have liked to see that we will proceed with status negotiations so that results can be achieved , " ahtisaari , a former finnish president and veteran peace broker , told a news conference in helsinki .
" i also express the hope that the situation will remain calm and that the constitution will be honored . " the un 's mission chief in kosovo said that rugova 's death came at a " tragic moment " for the province . " it is particularly tragic that president rugova should leave us in this very decisive moment for the future of kosovo , " said soren jessen-petersen in a statement .
" the best tribute that we can pay to president rugova and his legacy is to stay united during the coming months . " search for replacement rugova 's death opens the difficult issue of finding a replacement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister bajram kosumi is one potential successor many analysts believe none of rugova 's likely successors possess enough of the diplomatic acumen that he had on the world stage in the ethnic albanian push for independence from serbia . rugova 's death would make " the situation more fragile because the other leaders ... have no support from their parties to take the president 's throne , " local political analyst nexhmedin spahiu recently told afp news service . " i think we will have an unpredictable phase after rugova but no unrest , " spahiu said .

" the loss of president rugova comes at a particularly challenging time , " solana said in a statement .
" his wisdom and authority will be greatly missed .
at this difficult moment i call on all leaders of kosovo to show unity and responsibility . " rugova , who became president in march 2002 , died saturday of lung cancer , aged 61 , only days ahead of the start of talks wednesday in vienna on the final status of the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops in the eastern kosovo town of vitina in 2001 while the ethnic albanians , representing 90 percent of the population , are demanding independence , belgrade is only offering broad autonomy for kosovo .
the province has been run by the un and nato since june 1999 when the alliance 's air strikes led serbian forces under then serbian leader slobodan milosevic to withdraw from the province . the talks have now been postponed until february , un officials said . but un secretary general kofi annan said he believed rugova 's death " will not disrupt this process . " french president jacques chirac urged kosovo 's representatives to continue the negotiations in rugova 's " spirit of realism , tolerance and dialogue . " german chancellor angela merkel said rugova 's commitment to nonviolence and democracy should be " a legacy for all those who carry political responsibility in kosovo . " rugova crucial to peace talks the leadership of the charismatic kosovo leader , who was called the " gandhi of the balkan , " was considered crucial for the un-mediated negotiations . " with him kosovo has lost a historic leader who devoted his life to protecting and promoting the rights of the people of kosovo , " solana said .
" president rugova was a man of peace , firm in the face of oppression , but deeply committed to the ideals of non-violence . " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , also paid tribute to rugova , saying in a statement that it " appreciated his work for a peaceful solution to the problems of kosovo , and encourages all leaders to continue to work in this spirit . " a " tragic moment " for kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari the united nations chief mediator in kosovo , martti ahtisaari , meanwhile offered his " deepest condolences " to rugova 's family and also called for " calm " and continued negotiations in the province . " i 'm certain that president rugova would have liked to see that we will proceed with status negotiations so that results can be achieved , " ahtisaari , a former finnish president and veteran peace broker , told a news conference in helsinki .
" i also express the hope that the situation will remain calm and that the constitution will be honored . " the un 's mission chief in kosovo said that rugova 's death came at a " tragic moment " for the province . " it is particularly tragic that president rugova should leave us in this very decisive moment for the future of kosovo , " said soren jessen-petersen in a statement .
" the best tribute that we can pay to president rugova and his legacy is to stay united during the coming months . " search for replacement rugova 's death opens the difficult issue of finding a replacement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister bajram kosumi is one potential successor many analysts believe none of rugova 's likely successors possess enough of the diplomatic acumen that he had on the world stage in the ethnic albanian push for independence from serbia . rugova 's death would make " the situation more fragile because the other leaders ... have no support from their parties to take the president 's throne , " local political analyst nexhmedin spahiu recently told afp news service . " i think we will have an unpredictable phase after rugova but no unrest , " spahiu said .

" i am still hoping for some kind of clarification , " he told deutsche welle .
" i want to know why they did what they did to me , and that is why we brought the whole affair into the public domain .
no charges were brought against me in either afghanistan or skopje . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skopje , where el masri says he was first detained el masri said he was held in a hotel in the macedonian capital , skopje , and - after 23 days of imprisonment and interrogation there - was unknowingly taken to afghanistan . " at skopje airport i was told to go into a room where i would receive a medical examination , " he said .
" once inside , they blindfolded me and put me in handcuffs .
i was hit all over and then my clothes were torn from my body by sharp objects until i was standing there naked .
they humiliated me . then they tied me up , like in the pictures we know from guantanamo .
i was taken to a plane , thrown on the floor and given two shots of sedatives . " " i feared for my life " he goes on to explain that he did n't even know where he was until a fellow prisoner told him .
it was afghanistan .
during an interrogation , el masri deduced from his disguised interrogator 's perfect command of english , that he must be a cia agent . the german detainee was told he was in a place where there were no laws , and that nobody knew of his whereabouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-cultural centre in neu-ulm " the whole time i was in afghanistan i feared for my life , " he said .

both places are considered centers of islamic activity and have been on the radar of the bavarian office for the protection of the constitution for some time . mistaken identity ? he said his interrogator had access to detailed information about his life , which his lawyer has since confirmed could only come from the german intelligence services .

i knew then that they were threatening me , so when i got back , i recorded everything on video in case anything should happen to me .
then i called a lawyer and the press . "
the case only made it into the public sphere last year , by which time el masri had been released . the then governing coalition of social democrats and greens already knew of the incident .
former us ambassador dan coats had informed then interior minister otto schily about the abduction , but it was el masri 's lawyer who reported it to former foreign minister joschka fischer and his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , who was then the chancellery 's chief of staff .

" i am still hoping for some kind of clarification , " he told deutsche welle .
" i want to know why they did what they did to me , and that is why we brought the whole affair into the public domain .
no charges were brought against me in either afghanistan or skopje . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skopje , where el masri says he was first detained el masri said he was held in a hotel in the macedonian capital , skopje , and - after 23 days of imprisonment and interrogation there - was unknowingly taken to afghanistan . " at skopje airport i was told to go into a room where i would receive a medical examination , " he said .
" once inside , they blindfolded me and put me in handcuffs .
i was hit all over and then my clothes were torn from my body by sharp objects until i was standing there naked .
they humiliated me . then they tied me up , like in the pictures we know from guantanamo .
i was taken to a plane , thrown on the floor and given two shots of sedatives . " " i feared for my life " he goes on to explain that he did n't even know where he was until a fellow prisoner told him .
it was afghanistan .
during an interrogation , el masri deduced from his disguised interrogator 's perfect command of english , that he must be a cia agent . the german detainee was told he was in a place where there were no laws , and that nobody knew of his whereabouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-cultural centre in neu-ulm " the whole time i was in afghanistan i feared for my life , " he said .
" it was terrible for me . " el masri said he believes it was his connections to islamic centers in his hometown of neu-ulm and neighboring ulm which led to his abduction .
both places are considered centers of islamic activity and have been on the radar of the bavarian office for the protection of the constitution for some time . mistaken identity ? he said his interrogator had access to detailed information about his life , which his lawyer has since confirmed could only come from the german intelligence services .

i knew then that they were threatening me , so when i got back , i recorded everything on video in case anything should happen to me .
then i called a lawyer and the press . "
the case only made it into the public sphere last year , by which time el masri had been released . the then governing coalition of social democrats and greens already knew of the incident .
former us ambassador dan coats had informed then interior minister otto schily about the abduction , but it was el masri 's lawyer who reported it to former foreign minister joschka fischer and his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , who was then the chancellery 's chief of staff .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.01.2006 unions , employers prepare for bitter battle in wage talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a taste of things to come , aeg workers went on strike friday employers and unions sharpened their knives for a bitter battle in upcoming sector-wide wage talks in germany , with unions calling for pay increases and employers threatening to slash jobs and move abroad . ig metall , the powerful union for the engineering and metalworking sectors , officially announced its demand for the upcoming wage round , which begins on feb .
8 , calling for pay increases of 5 percent for the 3.4 million workers in industries ranging from cars to semi-conductors . the engineering and metalworking sectors are among the biggest and most important in germany and any deal there acts as a benchmark for other sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall represents germany 's engineering and metalworking sectors true to the traditional sabre-rattling that accompanies the negotiations , employers had already dismissed ig metall 's demands as excessive , irresponsible and impossible to finance . the employers federation gesamtmetall , which had said in december that pay increases of more than 1.2 percent would be unacceptable , complained that german companies already faced the highest labor costs among all their competitors . job exodus ? pushing those costs up even further would simply drive more jobs abroad , said federation chief martin kannegiesser . the head of the bvmw federation of mid-sized companies , mario ohoven , also warned of a " large-scale exodus of german jobs . " the head of the bda employers ' federation , dieter hundt , slammed ig metall 's demands as " irresponsible , " saying they sent the " wrong signal . " but ig metall argued that " wages equal purchasing power and wage increases revitalize the economy . " " our demands are affordable , " said ig metall chief jürgen peters .
" measured as a proportion of sales , companies have never paid so little for wages as they do now , " peters said . after years of merciless belt-tightening , unions insist employees must now get a piece of the cake . while unions accepted longer working hours and near-zero wage rounds in the past in return for safeguarding jobs in germany , companies have continued to slash jobs mercilessly , even as profits soared to record levels . nascent economic recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bda 's dieter hundt said ig metall is sending the wrong signal and with the euro zone 's biggest economy finally seeming to have turned the corner , they see higher wages as the way to kick-start sluggish domestic demand , which has long been the main hurdle to self-sustaining economic recovery . but employers refuse to accept such arguments , countering that two thirds of jobs in the engineering and metalworking sectors depend on exports , so that even if german consumers had more cash in their pocket , they were unlikely to spend it on german-made goods . with both sides prepared to dig their heels in , the coming months could turn into a winter of discontent in germany . traditionally , there is a four-week truce while wage talks are ongoing , forbidding any industrial action .
but if no agreement is reached by then , strikes might be on the agenda . a foretaste came on friday when workers at the nuremberg plant of electrical appliance maker aeg went on indefinite strike in protest against plans by the group 's swedish parent to shut down the factory . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , nation of reluctant strikers german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice .

world cup organizers , however , call the reporting irresponsible and are demanding a correction and apology from the magazine . dw-world : do you think the oc 's public calls for an apology from stiftung warentest are a good idea ? theo zwanziger : yes , it is urgently needed .
if i spread nonsense , i have to be ready to back off .
i can not give a red card to stadiums that among the best in the world .
what does giving a red card mean ?
the red card is expulsion from the competition .
it -lrb- the magazine -rrb- has strikingly entered the scene in a way that hurts the german world cup efforts and our country . do you think that stiftung warentest is going to back pedal ? i do n't know , and it does n't matter to me .
but we have to demand it .
we are not opposed to information , help or advice . bildunterschrift : testers said kaiserslautern 's renovated stadium was unsafe in the case of mass panic the press has started saying the oc whining , is this debate helping germany 's image before the world cup ? this has absolutely nothing to do with whining .
we owe the stadium operators a degree of protection .
they went to great efforts and spent a large amount of tax money , such as in kaiserslautern , to build a great stadium .
we are not going to let anyone say it deserves a red card . moving to the cancelled opening event fifa had planned for berlin .
was the problem really with the grass ? you can not underestimate that a world cup pitch for this kind of tournament is a little different than a field near a club team somewhere .
it is completely different .
not just the way it 's used , but even the television broadcasts and a number of other things make it a very different entity .
fundamentally , it is where the world cup happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers said the gala was cancelled to protect the pitch the dutch turf laying company is saying it could replace the turf in 17 hours without a problem . we 've had these experiences before .

the comments appeared to flatly contradict previous reported remarks by the bank 's president . " at the moment , iran does not have any schedule to transfer its foreign exchange accounts to the named countries , " mohammad-jafar mojarad told the state news agency irna when asked if iran has transferred the accounts to asia . conflicting statements the head of the central bank , ebrahim sheibani , had reportedly said on wednesday that iran was moving funds from europe elsewhere after western demands to freeze iranian assets as a result of the conflict over iran 's decision to resume nuclear research . the international crisis over iran 's nuclear program escalated when the islamic republic resumed sensitive uranium enrichment research on jan .
10 , despite calls by european negotiators to maintain a halt to such activities . " we transfer foreign currency reserves related to all sectors including oil foreign exchanges to wherever it is good for us and we have started this transfer , " sheibani was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at an oil refinery in tehran iran is expected to earn at least $ 40 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- from oil production this year .
in the past , iran has deposited its oil revenues in european banks . sheibani himself , however , on saturday rejected the idea that such transfers had already taken place , even though he left the door open for such a possibility in the future . " we will transfer iran 's foreign accounts whenever we believe it is necessary , " sheibani told state television . us : transfer a sign of growing isolation the united states said on friday that any iranian move to transfer currency deposits away from europe would be a sign of growing isolation .
us state department spokesman sean mccormack said such market maneuvers would not deter moves to refer its nuclear activities to the un security council . " i think it is an indication that iran is further isolating itself from the rest of the world , " mccormack told a press briefing .
" i do n't know what it is that they hope to accomplish by doing this . " london , paris and berlin called an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency for feb .
2 as western countries aim to gather support for referring iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . admadinejad calls for sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad meanwhile called on islamic states to use their economic power against the west . " along with the political war , there 's an big , hidden economic war going on and islamic states should use their potential to cut off the hands of the enemy , " he said . according to news reports , iranian leaders have also threatened that the nuclear stand-off might provoke an oil crisis . willing to compromise ? but despite the rhetoric , tehran seems willing to work out a diplomatic compromise behind the scenes . citing high-ranking government sources , german magazin der spiegel reported saturday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier received a message from the iranian government , saying that iran would be willing to negotiate a joint venture uranium enrichment program with russia and china . russia had suggested establishing such a program outside iran to alleviate western fears of iran using the technology to build nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : no ace out of chirac 's sleeve the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .

the comments appeared to flatly contradict previous reported remarks by the bank 's president . " at the moment , iran does not have any schedule to transfer its foreign exchange accounts to the named countries , " mohammad-jafar mojarad told the state news agency irna when asked if iran has transferred the accounts to asia . conflicting statements the head of the central bank , ebrahim sheibani , had reportedly said on wednesday that iran was moving funds from europe elsewhere after western demands to freeze iranian assets as a result of the conflict over iran 's decision to resume nuclear research . the international crisis over iran 's nuclear program escalated when the islamic republic resumed sensitive uranium enrichment research on jan .
10 , despite calls by european negotiators to maintain a halt to such activities . " we transfer foreign currency reserves related to all sectors including oil foreign exchanges to wherever it is good for us and we have started this transfer , " sheibani was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at an oil refinery in tehran iran is expected to earn at least $ 40 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- from oil production this year .
in the past , iran has deposited its oil revenues in european banks . sheibani himself , however , on saturday rejected the idea that such transfers had already taken place , even though he left the door open for such a possibility in the future . " we will transfer iran 's foreign accounts whenever we believe it is necessary , " sheibani told state television . us : transfer a sign of growing isolation the united states said on friday that any iranian move to transfer currency deposits away from europe would be a sign of growing isolation .
us state department spokesman sean mccormack said such market maneuvers would not deter moves to refer its nuclear activities to the un security council . " i think it is an indication that iran is further isolating itself from the rest of the world , " mccormack told a press briefing .
" i do n't know what it is that they hope to accomplish by doing this . " london , paris and berlin called an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency for feb .
2 as western countries aim to gather support for referring iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . admadinejad calls for sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad meanwhile called on islamic states to use their economic power against the west . " along with the political war , there 's an big , hidden economic war going on and islamic states should use their potential to cut off the hands of the enemy , " he said . according to news reports , iranian leaders have also threatened that the nuclear stand-off might provoke an oil crisis . willing to compromise ? but despite the rhetoric , tehran seems willing to work out a diplomatic compromise behind the scenes . citing high-ranking government sources , german magazin der spiegel reported saturday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier received a message from the iranian government , saying that iran would be willing to negotiate a joint venture uranium enrichment program with russia and china . russia had suggested establishing such a program outside iran to alleviate western fears of iran using the technology to build nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : no ace out of chirac 's sleeve the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .

" the loss of president rugova comes at a particularly challenging time , " solana said in a statement .
" his wisdom and authority will be greatly missed .
at this difficult moment i call on all leaders of kosovo to show unity and responsibility . " rugova , who became president in march 2002 , died saturday of lung cancer , aged 61 , only days ahead of the start of talks wednesday in vienna on the final status of the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops in the eastern kosovo town of vitina in 2001 while the ethnic albanians , representing 90 percent of the population , are demanding independence , belgrade is only offering broad autonomy for kosovo .
the province has been run by the un and nato since june 1999 when the alliance 's air strikes led serbian forces under then serbian leader slobodan milosevic to withdraw from the province . the talks have now been postponed until february , un officials said . but un secretary general kofi annan said he believed rugova 's death " will not disrupt this process . " french president jacques chirac urged kosovo 's representatives to continue the negotiations in rugova 's " spirit of realism , tolerance and dialogue . " german chancellor angela merkel said rugova 's commitment to nonviolence and democracy should be " a legacy for all those who carry political responsibility in kosovo . " rugova crucial to peace talks the leadership of the charismatic kosovo leader , who was called the " gandhi of the balkan , " was considered crucial for the un-mediated negotiations . " with him kosovo has lost a historic leader who devoted his life to protecting and promoting the rights of the people of kosovo , " solana said .
" president rugova was a man of peace , firm in the face of oppression , but deeply committed to the ideals of non-violence . " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , also paid tribute to rugova , saying in a statement that it " appreciated his work for a peaceful solution to the problems of kosovo , and encourages all leaders to continue to work in this spirit . " a " tragic moment " for kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari the united nations chief mediator in kosovo , martti ahtisaari , meanwhile offered his " deepest condolences " to rugova 's family and also called for " calm " and continued negotiations in the province . " i 'm certain that president rugova would have liked to see that we will proceed with status negotiations so that results can be achieved , " ahtisaari , a former finnish president and veteran peace broker , told a news conference in helsinki .
" i also express the hope that the situation will remain calm and that the constitution will be honored . " the un 's mission chief in kosovo said that rugova 's death came at a " tragic moment " for the province . " it is particularly tragic that president rugova should leave us in this very decisive moment for the future of kosovo , " said soren jessen-petersen in a statement .
" the best tribute that we can pay to president rugova and his legacy is to stay united during the coming months . " search for replacement rugova 's death opens the difficult issue of finding a replacement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister bajram kosumi is one potential successor many analysts believe none of rugova 's likely successors possess enough of the diplomatic acumen that he had on the world stage in the ethnic albanian push for independence from serbia . rugova 's death would make " the situation more fragile because the other leaders ... have no support from their parties to take the president 's throne , " local political analyst nexhmedin spahiu recently told afp news service . " i think we will have an unpredictable phase after rugova but no unrest , " spahiu said .

" i am still hoping for some kind of clarification , " he told deutsche welle .
" i want to know why they did what they did to me , and that is why we brought the whole affair into the public domain .
no charges were brought against me in either afghanistan or skopje . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skopje , where el masri says he was first detained el masri said he was held in a hotel in the macedonian capital , skopje , and - after 23 days of imprisonment and interrogation there - was unknowingly taken to afghanistan . " at skopje airport i was told to go into a room where i would receive a medical examination , " he said .
" once inside , they blindfolded me and put me in handcuffs .
i was hit all over and then my clothes were torn from my body by sharp objects until i was standing there naked .
they humiliated me . then they tied me up , like in the pictures we know from guantanamo .
i was taken to a plane , thrown on the floor and given two shots of sedatives . " " i feared for my life " he goes on to explain that he did n't even know where he was until a fellow prisoner told him .
it was afghanistan .
during an interrogation , el masri deduced from his disguised interrogator 's perfect command of english , that he must be a cia agent . the german detainee was told he was in a place where there were no laws , and that nobody knew of his whereabouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-cultural centre in neu-ulm " the whole time i was in afghanistan i feared for my life , " he said .

both places are considered centers of islamic activity and have been on the radar of the bavarian office for the protection of the constitution for some time . mistaken identity ? he said his interrogator had access to detailed information about his life , which his lawyer has since confirmed could only come from the german intelligence services .
were that the case , it would invalidate the theory that el masri had been mistaken for an al qaeda member of the same name .
the german government has refused to comment on a possible cooperation between its own intelligence authorities and the cia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister , otto schily " in afghanistan , i was asked what i would do on my release , whether i would go to the german authorities or the german press , " el masri said . " i was told i was clever enough to know better .
i knew then that they were threatening me , so when i got back , i recorded everything on video in case anything should happen to me .
then i called a lawyer and the press . "
the case only made it into the public sphere last year , by which time el masri had been released . the then governing coalition of social democrats and greens already knew of the incident .
former us ambassador dan coats had informed then interior minister otto schily about the abduction , but it was el masri 's lawyer who reported it to former foreign minister joschka fischer and his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , who was then the chancellery 's chief of staff .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 21.01.2006 consumer magazine damages cup preparation efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger said the 2006 world cup stadiums are among the world 's best too much is being made of the effects a german consumer magazine report that called world cup stadiums unsafe , the tournament 's organizing committee -lrb- oc -rrb- vice-president theo zwanziger told dw-world . german consumer reports magazine stiftung warentest two weeks ago released scathing results of tests it conducted on the 12 stadiums hosting the 2006 world cup .
world cup organizers , however , call the reporting irresponsible and are demanding a correction and apology from the magazine . dw-world : do you think the oc 's public calls for an apology from stiftung warentest are a good idea ? theo zwanziger : yes , it is urgently needed .
if i spread nonsense , i have to be ready to back off .
i can not give a red card to stadiums that among the best in the world .
what does giving a red card mean ?
the red card is expulsion from the competition .
it -lrb- the magazine -rrb- has strikingly entered the scene in a way that hurts the german world cup efforts and our country . do you think that stiftung warentest is going to back pedal ? i do n't know , and it does n't matter to me .
but we have to demand it .
we are not opposed to information , help or advice . bildunterschrift : testers said kaiserslautern 's renovated stadium was unsafe in the case of mass panic the press has started saying the oc whining , is this debate helping germany 's image before the world cup ? this has absolutely nothing to do with whining .
we owe the stadium operators a degree of protection .
they went to great efforts and spent a large amount of tax money , such as in kaiserslautern , to build a great stadium .
we are not going to let anyone say it deserves a red card . moving to the cancelled opening event fifa had planned for berlin .
was the problem really with the grass ? you can not underestimate that a world cup pitch for this kind of tournament is a little different than a field near a club team somewhere .
it is completely different .
not just the way it 's used , but even the television broadcasts and a number of other things make it a very different entity .
fundamentally , it is where the world cup happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers said the gala was cancelled to protect the pitch the dutch turf laying company is saying it could replace the turf in 17 hours without a problem . we 've had these experiences before .
turf laying companies and manufactures always say that .
but we have to guarantee success under even extremely harsh weather conditions .
they do n't know what kind of weather we 're going to have when the tournament comes around . but a trimmed down version of the show is going to take place in munich , where players will take the field a few hours later . the two events have absolutely nothing to do with each other .
absolutely nothing . so no one is going to go on the field in munich ? it will be covered .
there will not be any demands made of the turf in munich as was planned for the gala in berlin . the incidents with stiftung warentest and the berlin gala cancellation have tarnished the image of the 2006 world cup .
how do you see the current mood in germany ? it is possible to clear up a tarnished image .
that is why i do n't think the image in germany has been tarnished .
once the first match has started , we 'll see the same excitement we experienced during the confederations cup in an even greater form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger is upset about damage done to the world cup 's reputation and outside of germany ? outside of germany the safety of our stadiums has been irresponsibly discredited , and that is why i am so upset about what stiftung warentest has done .
people in england , austria , switzerland and holland are rubbing their hands with glee and pointing to stiftung warentest .
but that is something stiftung warentest has to work out with them . marcus bösch interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interior ministry urges calm over world cup stadium report a german parliamentarian has said there is " no cause for panic or hysteria " in response to the consumer group stiftung warentest ’ s safety assessment of the country ’ s world cup stadiums .

world cup organizers , however , call the reporting irresponsible and are demanding a correction and apology from the magazine . dw-world : do you think the oc 's public calls for an apology from stiftung warentest are a good idea ? theo zwanziger : yes , it is urgently needed .
if i spread nonsense , i have to be ready to back off .
i can not give a red card to stadiums that among the best in the world .
what does giving a red card mean ?
the red card is expulsion from the competition .
it -lrb- the magazine -rrb- has strikingly entered the scene in a way that hurts the german world cup efforts and our country . do you think that stiftung warentest is going to back pedal ? i do n't know , and it does n't matter to me .
but we have to demand it .
we are not opposed to information , help or advice . bildunterschrift : testers said kaiserslautern 's renovated stadium was unsafe in the case of mass panic the press has started saying the oc whining , is this debate helping germany 's image before the world cup ? this has absolutely nothing to do with whining .
we owe the stadium operators a degree of protection .
they went to great efforts and spent a large amount of tax money , such as in kaiserslautern , to build a great stadium .
we are not going to let anyone say it deserves a red card . moving to the cancelled opening event fifa had planned for berlin .
was the problem really with the grass ? you can not underestimate that a world cup pitch for this kind of tournament is a little different than a field near a club team somewhere .
it is completely different .
not just the way it 's used , but even the television broadcasts and a number of other things make it a very different entity .
fundamentally , it is where the world cup happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers said the gala was cancelled to protect the pitch the dutch turf laying company is saying it could replace the turf in 17 hours without a problem . we 've had these experiences before .
turf laying companies and manufactures always say that .
but we have to guarantee success under even extremely harsh weather conditions .
they do n't know what kind of weather we 're going to have when the tournament comes around . but a trimmed down version of the show is going to take place in munich , where players will take the field a few hours later . the two events have absolutely nothing to do with each other .
absolutely nothing . so no one is going to go on the field in munich ? it will be covered .
there will not be any demands made of the turf in munich as was planned for the gala in berlin . the incidents with stiftung warentest and the berlin gala cancellation have tarnished the image of the 2006 world cup .
how do you see the current mood in germany ? it is possible to clear up a tarnished image .
that is why i do n't think the image in germany has been tarnished .
once the first match has started , we 'll see the same excitement we experienced during the confederations cup in an even greater form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger is upset about damage done to the world cup 's reputation and outside of germany ? outside of germany the safety of our stadiums has been irresponsibly discredited , and that is why i am so upset about what stiftung warentest has done .

every day , germans light up 386 million cigarettes in public buildings , office blocks , cafés and elsewhere .
on billboards all over the country , the happy , smiling faces of smokers look down through the smog at puffing pedestrians . germany is bringing up the rear behind the countries that are leading the fight against smoking .
non-smokers are protected in belgium , the czech republic , ireland , italy , macedonia , malta , norway , spain and sweden .
in germany , however , there are very few public places where non-smokers can escape the toxic fumes . but there is a certain amount of desire for change .
in february 1998 , an anti-smoking initiative tried to exile smokers from hospitals , schools , bars , restaurants , discotheques and cinema lobbies .

" now we have a better chance .

germany continues to allow widespread tobacco advertising despite a proposed eu-wide ban supported by almost all the bloc 's members . germany steps up opposition to ad ban in december , the german government complained for the second time against the proposed ban , the decision on which is expected to be announced in the summer of this year . until then , and until germany comes into line with other eu nations on banning smoking , the country will remain a smoker 's paradise . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

every day , germans light up 386 million cigarettes in public buildings , office blocks , cafés and elsewhere .

every day , germans light up 386 million cigarettes in public buildings , office blocks , cafés and elsewhere .
on billboards all over the country , the happy , smiling faces of smokers look down through the smog at puffing pedestrians . germany is bringing up the rear behind the countries that are leading the fight against smoking .
non-smokers are protected in belgium , the czech republic , ireland , italy , macedonia , malta , norway , spain and sweden .
in germany , however , there are very few public places where non-smokers can escape the toxic fumes . but there is a certain amount of desire for change .
in february 1998 , an anti-smoking initiative tried to exile smokers from hospitals , schools , bars , restaurants , discotheques and cinema lobbies .
but , despite wide support from different parties , the plan failed due to opposition from members of the cabinet under then-chancellor helmut kohl . smoke clearing for opposition groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german no-smoking groups want a ban like in spain however , health experts have not surrendered and now see a chance to get the ball rolling again in the campaign for a more widespread ban in germany . " to our knowledge , chancellor merkel is a non-smoker , " friedrich wiebel , spokesman for the non-smokers action alliance , told the ap news agency recently .
" now we have a better chance . " the alliance is backed by a number of health organizations that aim to present a draft initiative that will lead to a ban on smoking inside public buildings . the alliance is relying on the support of health minister ulla schmidt to expand the existing regulations in germany .
under schmidt 's watch , the german government in 2005 reached a voluntary agreement with restaurant and bar proprietors for the creation of limited no-smoking areas in 30 percent of all licensed premises . partial ban to be extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bars and restaurants will have to give half their premises over to non-smokers this partial smoking ban is scheduled to be extended to 90 percent of all bars and restaurants in germany by march 1 , 2008 .
by then , owners will be required to provide 50 percent of their premises for non-smokers . on average , 3,300 people die each year from smoking related illnesses in germany , a figure that has continually caused the medical community to call on the government to " break with the tobacco lobby " and make a concerted attempt at reversing the deadly trend . doctors ' organizations have criticized the government for considering logical regulations like banning smoking in schools , hospitals and the workplace while still cozying up to the tobacco industry .
germany continues to allow widespread tobacco advertising despite a proposed eu-wide ban supported by almost all the bloc 's members . germany steps up opposition to ad ban in december , the german government complained for the second time against the proposed ban , the decision on which is expected to be announced in the summer of this year . until then , and until germany comes into line with other eu nations on banning smoking , the country will remain a smoker 's paradise . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

" i am still hoping for some kind of clarification , " he told deutsche welle .
" i want to know why they did what they did to me , and that is why we brought the whole affair into the public domain .
no charges were brought against me in either afghanistan or skopje . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skopje , where el masri says he was first detained el masri said he was held in a hotel in the macedonian capital , skopje , and - after 23 days of imprisonment and interrogation there - was unknowingly taken to afghanistan . " at skopje airport i was told to go into a room where i would receive a medical examination , " he said .
" once inside , they blindfolded me and put me in handcuffs .
i was hit all over and then my clothes were torn from my body by sharp objects until i was standing there naked .
they humiliated me . then they tied me up , like in the pictures we know from guantanamo .
i was taken to a plane , thrown on the floor and given two shots of sedatives . " " i feared for my life " he goes on to explain that he did n't even know where he was until a fellow prisoner told him .
it was afghanistan .
during an interrogation , el masri deduced from his disguised interrogator 's perfect command of english , that he must be a cia agent . the german detainee was told he was in a place where there were no laws , and that nobody knew of his whereabouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-cultural centre in neu-ulm " the whole time i was in afghanistan i feared for my life , " he said .
" it was terrible for me . " el masri said he believes it was his connections to islamic centers in his hometown of neu-ulm and neighboring ulm which led to his abduction .
both places are considered centers of islamic activity and have been on the radar of the bavarian office for the protection of the constitution for some time . mistaken identity ? he said his interrogator had access to detailed information about his life , which his lawyer has since confirmed could only come from the german intelligence services .
were that the case , it would invalidate the theory that el masri had been mistaken for an al qaeda member of the same name .
the german government has refused to comment on a possible cooperation between its own intelligence authorities and the cia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister , otto schily " in afghanistan , i was asked what i would do on my release , whether i would go to the german authorities or the german press , " el masri said . " i was told i was clever enough to know better .
i knew then that they were threatening me , so when i got back , i recorded everything on video in case anything should happen to me .
then i called a lawyer and the press . "
the case only made it into the public sphere last year , by which time el masri had been released . the then governing coalition of social democrats and greens already knew of the incident .
former us ambassador dan coats had informed then interior minister otto schily about the abduction , but it was el masri 's lawyer who reported it to former foreign minister joschka fischer and his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , who was then the chancellery 's chief of staff .
exactly what the government did with that information in order to clarify the case remains a mystery . german chancellor angela merkel has said that the case will be take up by a parliamentary committee . mirjam gehrke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the united states for some of its tactics in the fight against terrorism and called for the guantanamo bay detention center to be closed in an interview published saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany still lighting up much of europe bans smoking ; germany keeps puffing away germany 's close ties to big tobacco germany gets eu slap on the wrist over tobacco laws tobacco companies see clouds in germany germany -pipe- 21.01.2006 germany : european smoker 's paradise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers can light up almost anywhere in germany while nine european countries have already brought in comprehensive anti-smoking restrictions , germany is one of those lagging behind . in spite of increased taxes on tobacco and partial , voluntary smoking bans in restaurants and bars , germany remains a smoker 's paradise .
every day , germans light up 386 million cigarettes in public buildings , office blocks , cafés and elsewhere .
on billboards all over the country , the happy , smiling faces of smokers look down through the smog at puffing pedestrians . germany is bringing up the rear behind the countries that are leading the fight against smoking .
non-smokers are protected in belgium , the czech republic , ireland , italy , macedonia , malta , norway , spain and sweden .
in germany , however , there are very few public places where non-smokers can escape the toxic fumes . but there is a certain amount of desire for change .
in february 1998 , an anti-smoking initiative tried to exile smokers from hospitals , schools , bars , restaurants , discotheques and cinema lobbies .
but , despite wide support from different parties , the plan failed due to opposition from members of the cabinet under then-chancellor helmut kohl . smoke clearing for opposition groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german no-smoking groups want a ban like in spain however , health experts have not surrendered and now see a chance to get the ball rolling again in the campaign for a more widespread ban in germany . " to our knowledge , chancellor merkel is a non-smoker , " friedrich wiebel , spokesman for the non-smokers action alliance , told the ap news agency recently .
" now we have a better chance . " the alliance is backed by a number of health organizations that aim to present a draft initiative that will lead to a ban on smoking inside public buildings . the alliance is relying on the support of health minister ulla schmidt to expand the existing regulations in germany .
under schmidt 's watch , the german government in 2005 reached a voluntary agreement with restaurant and bar proprietors for the creation of limited no-smoking areas in 30 percent of all licensed premises . partial ban to be extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bars and restaurants will have to give half their premises over to non-smokers this partial smoking ban is scheduled to be extended to 90 percent of all bars and restaurants in germany by march 1 , 2008 .
by then , owners will be required to provide 50 percent of their premises for non-smokers . on average , 3,300 people die each year from smoking related illnesses in germany , a figure that has continually caused the medical community to call on the government to " break with the tobacco lobby " and make a concerted attempt at reversing the deadly trend . doctors ' organizations have criticized the government for considering logical regulations like banning smoking in schools , hospitals and the workplace while still cozying up to the tobacco industry .
germany continues to allow widespread tobacco advertising despite a proposed eu-wide ban supported by almost all the bloc 's members . germany steps up opposition to ad ban in december , the german government complained for the second time against the proposed ban , the decision on which is expected to be announced in the summer of this year . until then , and until germany comes into line with other eu nations on banning smoking , the country will remain a smoker 's paradise . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

2 , 2006 -rrb- germany 's close ties to big tobacco top german researchers have been paid off by the tobacco industry to play down the health effects of smoking , a study says .

" i am still hoping for some kind of clarification , " he told deutsche welle .
" i want to know why they did what they did to me , and that is why we brought the whole affair into the public domain .
no charges were brought against me in either afghanistan or skopje . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skopje , where el masri says he was first detained el masri said he was held in a hotel in the macedonian capital , skopje , and - after 23 days of imprisonment and interrogation there - was unknowingly taken to afghanistan . " at skopje airport i was told to go into a room where i would receive a medical examination , " he said .
" once inside , they blindfolded me and put me in handcuffs .
i was hit all over and then my clothes were torn from my body by sharp objects until i was standing there naked .
they humiliated me . then they tied me up , like in the pictures we know from guantanamo .
i was taken to a plane , thrown on the floor and given two shots of sedatives . " " i feared for my life " he goes on to explain that he did n't even know where he was until a fellow prisoner told him .
it was afghanistan .
during an interrogation , el masri deduced from his disguised interrogator 's perfect command of english , that he must be a cia agent . the german detainee was told he was in a place where there were no laws , and that nobody knew of his whereabouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-cultural centre in neu-ulm " the whole time i was in afghanistan i feared for my life , " he said .
" it was terrible for me . " el masri said he believes it was his connections to islamic centers in his hometown of neu-ulm and neighboring ulm which led to his abduction .
both places are considered centers of islamic activity and have been on the radar of the bavarian office for the protection of the constitution for some time . mistaken identity ? he said his interrogator had access to detailed information about his life , which his lawyer has since confirmed could only come from the german intelligence services .
were that the case , it would invalidate the theory that el masri had been mistaken for an al qaeda member of the same name .
the german government has refused to comment on a possible cooperation between its own intelligence authorities and the cia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister , otto schily " in afghanistan , i was asked what i would do on my release , whether i would go to the german authorities or the german press , " el masri said . " i was told i was clever enough to know better .
i knew then that they were threatening me , so when i got back , i recorded everything on video in case anything should happen to me .
then i called a lawyer and the press . "
the case only made it into the public sphere last year , by which time el masri had been released . the then governing coalition of social democrats and greens already knew of the incident .
former us ambassador dan coats had informed then interior minister otto schily about the abduction , but it was el masri 's lawyer who reported it to former foreign minister joschka fischer and his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , who was then the chancellery 's chief of staff .
exactly what the government did with that information in order to clarify the case remains a mystery . german chancellor angela merkel has said that the case will be take up by a parliamentary committee . mirjam gehrke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the united states for some of its tactics in the fight against terrorism and called for the guantanamo bay detention center to be closed in an interview published saturday .

every day , germans light up 386 million cigarettes in public buildings , office blocks , cafés and elsewhere .
on billboards all over the country , the happy , smiling faces of smokers look down through the smog at puffing pedestrians . germany is bringing up the rear behind the countries that are leading the fight against smoking .
non-smokers are protected in belgium , the czech republic , ireland , italy , macedonia , malta , norway , spain and sweden .
in germany , however , there are very few public places where non-smokers can escape the toxic fumes . but there is a certain amount of desire for change .
in february 1998 , an anti-smoking initiative tried to exile smokers from hospitals , schools , bars , restaurants , discotheques and cinema lobbies .
but , despite wide support from different parties , the plan failed due to opposition from members of the cabinet under then-chancellor helmut kohl . smoke clearing for opposition groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german no-smoking groups want a ban like in spain however , health experts have not surrendered and now see a chance to get the ball rolling again in the campaign for a more widespread ban in germany . " to our knowledge , chancellor merkel is a non-smoker , " friedrich wiebel , spokesman for the non-smokers action alliance , told the ap news agency recently .
" now we have a better chance . " the alliance is backed by a number of health organizations that aim to present a draft initiative that will lead to a ban on smoking inside public buildings . the alliance is relying on the support of health minister ulla schmidt to expand the existing regulations in germany .
under schmidt 's watch , the german government in 2005 reached a voluntary agreement with restaurant and bar proprietors for the creation of limited no-smoking areas in 30 percent of all licensed premises . partial ban to be extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bars and restaurants will have to give half their premises over to non-smokers this partial smoking ban is scheduled to be extended to 90 percent of all bars and restaurants in germany by march 1 , 2008 .
by then , owners will be required to provide 50 percent of their premises for non-smokers . on average , 3,300 people die each year from smoking related illnesses in germany , a figure that has continually caused the medical community to call on the government to " break with the tobacco lobby " and make a concerted attempt at reversing the deadly trend . doctors ' organizations have criticized the government for considering logical regulations like banning smoking in schools , hospitals and the workplace while still cozying up to the tobacco industry .
germany continues to allow widespread tobacco advertising despite a proposed eu-wide ban supported by almost all the bloc 's members . germany steps up opposition to ad ban in december , the german government complained for the second time against the proposed ban , the decision on which is expected to be announced in the summer of this year . until then , and until germany comes into line with other eu nations on banning smoking , the country will remain a smoker 's paradise . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.01.2006 iran denies shifting assets from europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it is not moving billions in oil revenues out of europe iran on saturday denied it has shifted funds out of europe due to fears of economic sanctions over its nuclear program after a swirl of contradictory reports on whether such transfers had taken place . a deputy central bank chief categorically denied that iran was moving foreign currency out of europe to southeast asia .
the comments appeared to flatly contradict previous reported remarks by the bank 's president . " at the moment , iran does not have any schedule to transfer its foreign exchange accounts to the named countries , " mohammad-jafar mojarad told the state news agency irna when asked if iran has transferred the accounts to asia . conflicting statements the head of the central bank , ebrahim sheibani , had reportedly said on wednesday that iran was moving funds from europe elsewhere after western demands to freeze iranian assets as a result of the conflict over iran 's decision to resume nuclear research . the international crisis over iran 's nuclear program escalated when the islamic republic resumed sensitive uranium enrichment research on jan .
10 , despite calls by european negotiators to maintain a halt to such activities . " we transfer foreign currency reserves related to all sectors including oil foreign exchanges to wherever it is good for us and we have started this transfer , " sheibani was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at an oil refinery in tehran iran is expected to earn at least $ 40 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- from oil production this year .
in the past , iran has deposited its oil revenues in european banks . sheibani himself , however , on saturday rejected the idea that such transfers had already taken place , even though he left the door open for such a possibility in the future . " we will transfer iran 's foreign accounts whenever we believe it is necessary , " sheibani told state television . us : transfer a sign of growing isolation the united states said on friday that any iranian move to transfer currency deposits away from europe would be a sign of growing isolation .
us state department spokesman sean mccormack said such market maneuvers would not deter moves to refer its nuclear activities to the un security council . " i think it is an indication that iran is further isolating itself from the rest of the world , " mccormack told a press briefing .
" i do n't know what it is that they hope to accomplish by doing this . " london , paris and berlin called an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency for feb .
2 as western countries aim to gather support for referring iran to the un security council for possible sanctions . admadinejad calls for sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad meanwhile called on islamic states to use their economic power against the west . " along with the political war , there 's an big , hidden economic war going on and islamic states should use their potential to cut off the hands of the enemy , " he said . according to news reports , iranian leaders have also threatened that the nuclear stand-off might provoke an oil crisis . willing to compromise ? but despite the rhetoric , tehran seems willing to work out a diplomatic compromise behind the scenes . citing high-ranking government sources , german magazin der spiegel reported saturday that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier received a message from the iranian government , saying that iran would be willing to negotiate a joint venture uranium enrichment program with russia and china . russia had suggested establishing such a program outside iran to alleviate western fears of iran using the technology to build nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : no ace out of chirac 's sleeve the controversial statements by france 's president on the country 's nuclear potential have triggered international protests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 21.01.2006 consumer magazine damages cup preparation efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger said the 2006 world cup stadiums are among the world 's best too much is being made of the effects a german consumer magazine report that called world cup stadiums unsafe , the tournament 's organizing committee -lrb- oc -rrb- vice-president theo zwanziger told dw-world . german consumer reports magazine stiftung warentest two weeks ago released scathing results of tests it conducted on the 12 stadiums hosting the 2006 world cup .
world cup organizers , however , call the reporting irresponsible and are demanding a correction and apology from the magazine . dw-world : do you think the oc 's public calls for an apology from stiftung warentest are a good idea ? theo zwanziger : yes , it is urgently needed .
if i spread nonsense , i have to be ready to back off .
i can not give a red card to stadiums that among the best in the world .
what does giving a red card mean ?
the red card is expulsion from the competition .
it -lrb- the magazine -rrb- has strikingly entered the scene in a way that hurts the german world cup efforts and our country . do you think that stiftung warentest is going to back pedal ? i do n't know , and it does n't matter to me .
but we have to demand it .
we are not opposed to information , help or advice . bildunterschrift : testers said kaiserslautern 's renovated stadium was unsafe in the case of mass panic the press has started saying the oc whining , is this debate helping germany 's image before the world cup ? this has absolutely nothing to do with whining .
we owe the stadium operators a degree of protection .
they went to great efforts and spent a large amount of tax money , such as in kaiserslautern , to build a great stadium .
we are not going to let anyone say it deserves a red card . moving to the cancelled opening event fifa had planned for berlin .
was the problem really with the grass ? you can not underestimate that a world cup pitch for this kind of tournament is a little different than a field near a club team somewhere .
it is completely different .
not just the way it 's used , but even the television broadcasts and a number of other things make it a very different entity .
fundamentally , it is where the world cup happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers said the gala was cancelled to protect the pitch the dutch turf laying company is saying it could replace the turf in 17 hours without a problem . we 've had these experiences before .
turf laying companies and manufactures always say that .
but we have to guarantee success under even extremely harsh weather conditions .
they do n't know what kind of weather we 're going to have when the tournament comes around . but a trimmed down version of the show is going to take place in munich , where players will take the field a few hours later . the two events have absolutely nothing to do with each other .
absolutely nothing . so no one is going to go on the field in munich ? it will be covered .
there will not be any demands made of the turf in munich as was planned for the gala in berlin . the incidents with stiftung warentest and the berlin gala cancellation have tarnished the image of the 2006 world cup .
how do you see the current mood in germany ? it is possible to clear up a tarnished image .
that is why i do n't think the image in germany has been tarnished .
once the first match has started , we 'll see the same excitement we experienced during the confederations cup in an even greater form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger is upset about damage done to the world cup 's reputation and outside of germany ? outside of germany the safety of our stadiums has been irresponsibly discredited , and that is why i am so upset about what stiftung warentest has done .
people in england , austria , switzerland and holland are rubbing their hands with glee and pointing to stiftung warentest .
but that is something stiftung warentest has to work out with them . marcus bösch interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interior ministry urges calm over world cup stadium report a german parliamentarian has said there is " no cause for panic or hysteria " in response to the consumer group stiftung warentest ’ s safety assessment of the country ’ s world cup stadiums .
-lrb- jan .
19 , 2006 -rrb- world cup gala gets the ax the star-studded gala which was to open the 2006 world cup in berlin has been cancelled due to concerns over damage to the olympic stadium 's pitch .

world cup organizers , however , call the reporting irresponsible and are demanding a correction and apology from the magazine . dw-world : do you think the oc 's public calls for an apology from stiftung warentest are a good idea ? theo zwanziger : yes , it is urgently needed .
if i spread nonsense , i have to be ready to back off .
i can not give a red card to stadiums that among the best in the world .
what does giving a red card mean ?
the red card is expulsion from the competition .
it -lrb- the magazine -rrb- has strikingly entered the scene in a way that hurts the german world cup efforts and our country . do you think that stiftung warentest is going to back pedal ? i do n't know , and it does n't matter to me .
but we have to demand it .
we are not opposed to information , help or advice . bildunterschrift : testers said kaiserslautern 's renovated stadium was unsafe in the case of mass panic the press has started saying the oc whining , is this debate helping germany 's image before the world cup ? this has absolutely nothing to do with whining .
we owe the stadium operators a degree of protection .
they went to great efforts and spent a large amount of tax money , such as in kaiserslautern , to build a great stadium .
we are not going to let anyone say it deserves a red card . moving to the cancelled opening event fifa had planned for berlin .
was the problem really with the grass ? you can not underestimate that a world cup pitch for this kind of tournament is a little different than a field near a club team somewhere .

they do n't know what kind of weather we 're going to have when the tournament comes around . but a trimmed down version of the show is going to take place in munich , where players will take the field a few hours later . the two events have absolutely nothing to do with each other .
absolutely nothing . so no one is going to go on the field in munich ? it will be covered .
there will not be any demands made of the turf in munich as was planned for the gala in berlin . the incidents with stiftung warentest and the berlin gala cancellation have tarnished the image of the 2006 world cup .
how do you see the current mood in germany ? it is possible to clear up a tarnished image .

world cup organizers , however , call the reporting irresponsible and are demanding a correction and apology from the magazine . dw-world : do you think the oc 's public calls for an apology from stiftung warentest are a good idea ? theo zwanziger : yes , it is urgently needed .
if i spread nonsense , i have to be ready to back off .
i can not give a red card to stadiums that among the best in the world .
what does giving a red card mean ?
the red card is expulsion from the competition .
it -lrb- the magazine -rrb- has strikingly entered the scene in a way that hurts the german world cup efforts and our country . do you think that stiftung warentest is going to back pedal ? i do n't know , and it does n't matter to me .
but we have to demand it .
we are not opposed to information , help or advice . bildunterschrift : testers said kaiserslautern 's renovated stadium was unsafe in the case of mass panic the press has started saying the oc whining , is this debate helping germany 's image before the world cup ? this has absolutely nothing to do with whining .
we owe the stadium operators a degree of protection .
they went to great efforts and spent a large amount of tax money , such as in kaiserslautern , to build a great stadium .
we are not going to let anyone say it deserves a red card . moving to the cancelled opening event fifa had planned for berlin .
was the problem really with the grass ? you can not underestimate that a world cup pitch for this kind of tournament is a little different than a field near a club team somewhere .
it is completely different .
not just the way it 's used , but even the television broadcasts and a number of other things make it a very different entity .
fundamentally , it is where the world cup happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers said the gala was cancelled to protect the pitch the dutch turf laying company is saying it could replace the turf in 17 hours without a problem . we 've had these experiences before .
turf laying companies and manufactures always say that .
but we have to guarantee success under even extremely harsh weather conditions .
they do n't know what kind of weather we 're going to have when the tournament comes around . but a trimmed down version of the show is going to take place in munich , where players will take the field a few hours later . the two events have absolutely nothing to do with each other .
absolutely nothing . so no one is going to go on the field in munich ? it will be covered .
there will not be any demands made of the turf in munich as was planned for the gala in berlin . the incidents with stiftung warentest and the berlin gala cancellation have tarnished the image of the 2006 world cup .
how do you see the current mood in germany ? it is possible to clear up a tarnished image .
that is why i do n't think the image in germany has been tarnished .
once the first match has started , we 'll see the same excitement we experienced during the confederations cup in an even greater form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger is upset about damage done to the world cup 's reputation and outside of germany ? outside of germany the safety of our stadiums has been irresponsibly discredited , and that is why i am so upset about what stiftung warentest has done .
people in england , austria , switzerland and holland are rubbing their hands with glee and pointing to stiftung warentest .
but that is something stiftung warentest has to work out with them . marcus bösch interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interior ministry urges calm over world cup stadium report a german parliamentarian has said there is " no cause for panic or hysteria " in response to the consumer group stiftung warentest ’ s safety assessment of the country ’ s world cup stadiums .
-lrb- jan .
19 , 2006 -rrb- world cup gala gets the ax the star-studded gala which was to open the 2006 world cup in berlin has been cancelled due to concerns over damage to the olympic stadium 's pitch .
some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs .
-lrb- jan .
13 , 2006 -rrb- german watchdog warns world cup stadiums unsafe a german consumer protection group has pinpointed " serious deficiencies " in safety at four of the 12 stadiums to be used during the soccer world cup finals in june .
german soccer officials have rejected the accusations .

" i am still hoping for some kind of clarification , " he told deutsche welle .
" i want to know why they did what they did to me , and that is why we brought the whole affair into the public domain .
no charges were brought against me in either afghanistan or skopje . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skopje , where el masri says he was first detained el masri said he was held in a hotel in the macedonian capital , skopje , and - after 23 days of imprisonment and interrogation there - was unknowingly taken to afghanistan . " at skopje airport i was told to go into a room where i would receive a medical examination , " he said .
" once inside , they blindfolded me and put me in handcuffs .
i was hit all over and then my clothes were torn from my body by sharp objects until i was standing there naked .
they humiliated me . then they tied me up , like in the pictures we know from guantanamo .
i was taken to a plane , thrown on the floor and given two shots of sedatives . " " i feared for my life " he goes on to explain that he did n't even know where he was until a fellow prisoner told him .
it was afghanistan .

both places are considered centers of islamic activity and have been on the radar of the bavarian office for the protection of the constitution for some time . mistaken identity ? he said his interrogator had access to detailed information about his life , which his lawyer has since confirmed could only come from the german intelligence services .

i knew then that they were threatening me , so when i got back , i recorded everything on video in case anything should happen to me .
then i called a lawyer and the press . "
the case only made it into the public sphere last year , by which time el masri had been released . the then governing coalition of social democrats and greens already knew of the incident .
former us ambassador dan coats had informed then interior minister otto schily about the abduction , but it was el masri 's lawyer who reported it to former foreign minister joschka fischer and his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , who was then the chancellery 's chief of staff .

" i am still hoping for some kind of clarification , " he told deutsche welle .
" i want to know why they did what they did to me , and that is why we brought the whole affair into the public domain .
no charges were brought against me in either afghanistan or skopje . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skopje , where el masri says he was first detained el masri said he was held in a hotel in the macedonian capital , skopje , and - after 23 days of imprisonment and interrogation there - was unknowingly taken to afghanistan . " at skopje airport i was told to go into a room where i would receive a medical examination , " he said .
" once inside , they blindfolded me and put me in handcuffs .
i was hit all over and then my clothes were torn from my body by sharp objects until i was standing there naked .
they humiliated me . then they tied me up , like in the pictures we know from guantanamo .
i was taken to a plane , thrown on the floor and given two shots of sedatives . " " i feared for my life " he goes on to explain that he did n't even know where he was until a fellow prisoner told him .
it was afghanistan .
during an interrogation , el masri deduced from his disguised interrogator 's perfect command of english , that he must be a cia agent . the german detainee was told he was in a place where there were no laws , and that nobody knew of his whereabouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multi-cultural centre in neu-ulm " the whole time i was in afghanistan i feared for my life , " he said .
" it was terrible for me . " el masri said he believes it was his connections to islamic centers in his hometown of neu-ulm and neighboring ulm which led to his abduction .
both places are considered centers of islamic activity and have been on the radar of the bavarian office for the protection of the constitution for some time . mistaken identity ? he said his interrogator had access to detailed information about his life , which his lawyer has since confirmed could only come from the german intelligence services .
were that the case , it would invalidate the theory that el masri had been mistaken for an al qaeda member of the same name .
the german government has refused to comment on a possible cooperation between its own intelligence authorities and the cia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister , otto schily " in afghanistan , i was asked what i would do on my release , whether i would go to the german authorities or the german press , " el masri said . " i was told i was clever enough to know better .
i knew then that they were threatening me , so when i got back , i recorded everything on video in case anything should happen to me .
then i called a lawyer and the press . "
the case only made it into the public sphere last year , by which time el masri had been released . the then governing coalition of social democrats and greens already knew of the incident .
former us ambassador dan coats had informed then interior minister otto schily about the abduction , but it was el masri 's lawyer who reported it to former foreign minister joschka fischer and his successor , frank-walter steinmeier , who was then the chancellery 's chief of staff .
exactly what the government did with that information in order to clarify the case remains a mystery . german chancellor angela merkel has said that the case will be take up by a parliamentary committee . mirjam gehrke -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the united states for some of its tactics in the fight against terrorism and called for the guantanamo bay detention center to be closed in an interview published saturday .

every day , germans light up 386 million cigarettes in public buildings , office blocks , cafés and elsewhere .
on billboards all over the country , the happy , smiling faces of smokers look down through the smog at puffing pedestrians . germany is bringing up the rear behind the countries that are leading the fight against smoking .
non-smokers are protected in belgium , the czech republic , ireland , italy , macedonia , malta , norway , spain and sweden .
in germany , however , there are very few public places where non-smokers can escape the toxic fumes . but there is a certain amount of desire for change .
in february 1998 , an anti-smoking initiative tried to exile smokers from hospitals , schools , bars , restaurants , discotheques and cinema lobbies .
but , despite wide support from different parties , the plan failed due to opposition from members of the cabinet under then-chancellor helmut kohl . smoke clearing for opposition groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german no-smoking groups want a ban like in spain however , health experts have not surrendered and now see a chance to get the ball rolling again in the campaign for a more widespread ban in germany . " to our knowledge , chancellor merkel is a non-smoker , " friedrich wiebel , spokesman for the non-smokers action alliance , told the ap news agency recently .
" now we have a better chance . " the alliance is backed by a number of health organizations that aim to present a draft initiative that will lead to a ban on smoking inside public buildings . the alliance is relying on the support of health minister ulla schmidt to expand the existing regulations in germany .
under schmidt 's watch , the german government in 2005 reached a voluntary agreement with restaurant and bar proprietors for the creation of limited no-smoking areas in 30 percent of all licensed premises . partial ban to be extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bars and restaurants will have to give half their premises over to non-smokers this partial smoking ban is scheduled to be extended to 90 percent of all bars and restaurants in germany by march 1 , 2008 .
by then , owners will be required to provide 50 percent of their premises for non-smokers . on average , 3,300 people die each year from smoking related illnesses in germany , a figure that has continually caused the medical community to call on the government to " break with the tobacco lobby " and make a concerted attempt at reversing the deadly trend . doctors ' organizations have criticized the government for considering logical regulations like banning smoking in schools , hospitals and the workplace while still cozying up to the tobacco industry .
germany continues to allow widespread tobacco advertising despite a proposed eu-wide ban supported by almost all the bloc 's members . germany steps up opposition to ad ban in december , the german government complained for the second time against the proposed ban , the decision on which is expected to be announced in the summer of this year . until then , and until germany comes into line with other eu nations on banning smoking , the country will remain a smoker 's paradise . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

every day , germans light up 386 million cigarettes in public buildings , office blocks , cafés and elsewhere .
on billboards all over the country , the happy , smiling faces of smokers look down through the smog at puffing pedestrians . germany is bringing up the rear behind the countries that are leading the fight against smoking .
non-smokers are protected in belgium , the czech republic , ireland , italy , macedonia , malta , norway , spain and sweden .
in germany , however , there are very few public places where non-smokers can escape the toxic fumes . but there is a certain amount of desire for change .
in february 1998 , an anti-smoking initiative tried to exile smokers from hospitals , schools , bars , restaurants , discotheques and cinema lobbies .
but , despite wide support from different parties , the plan failed due to opposition from members of the cabinet under then-chancellor helmut kohl . smoke clearing for opposition groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german no-smoking groups want a ban like in spain however , health experts have not surrendered and now see a chance to get the ball rolling again in the campaign for a more widespread ban in germany . " to our knowledge , chancellor merkel is a non-smoker , " friedrich wiebel , spokesman for the non-smokers action alliance , told the ap news agency recently .
" now we have a better chance . " the alliance is backed by a number of health organizations that aim to present a draft initiative that will lead to a ban on smoking inside public buildings . the alliance is relying on the support of health minister ulla schmidt to expand the existing regulations in germany .
under schmidt 's watch , the german government in 2005 reached a voluntary agreement with restaurant and bar proprietors for the creation of limited no-smoking areas in 30 percent of all licensed premises . partial ban to be extended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bars and restaurants will have to give half their premises over to non-smokers this partial smoking ban is scheduled to be extended to 90 percent of all bars and restaurants in germany by march 1 , 2008 .
by then , owners will be required to provide 50 percent of their premises for non-smokers . on average , 3,300 people die each year from smoking related illnesses in germany , a figure that has continually caused the medical community to call on the government to " break with the tobacco lobby " and make a concerted attempt at reversing the deadly trend . doctors ' organizations have criticized the government for considering logical regulations like banning smoking in schools , hospitals and the workplace while still cozying up to the tobacco industry .
germany continues to allow widespread tobacco advertising despite a proposed eu-wide ban supported by almost all the bloc 's members . germany steps up opposition to ad ban in december , the german government complained for the second time against the proposed ban , the decision on which is expected to be announced in the summer of this year . until then , and until germany comes into line with other eu nations on banning smoking , the country will remain a smoker 's paradise . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spanish face smoke-free new year spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude .

" the loss of president rugova comes at a particularly challenging time , " solana said in a statement .
" his wisdom and authority will be greatly missed .
at this difficult moment i call on all leaders of kosovo to show unity and responsibility . " rugova , who became president in march 2002 , died saturday of lung cancer , aged 61 , only days ahead of the start of talks wednesday in vienna on the final status of the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops in the eastern kosovo town of vitina in 2001 while the ethnic albanians , representing 90 percent of the population , are demanding independence , belgrade is only offering broad autonomy for kosovo .
the province has been run by the un and nato since june 1999 when the alliance 's air strikes led serbian forces under then serbian leader slobodan milosevic to withdraw from the province . the talks have now been postponed until february , un officials said . but un secretary general kofi annan said he believed rugova 's death " will not disrupt this process . " french president jacques chirac urged kosovo 's representatives to continue the negotiations in rugova 's " spirit of realism , tolerance and dialogue . " german chancellor angela merkel said rugova 's commitment to nonviolence and democracy should be " a legacy for all those who carry political responsibility in kosovo . " rugova crucial to peace talks the leadership of the charismatic kosovo leader , who was called the " gandhi of the balkan , " was considered crucial for the un-mediated negotiations . " with him kosovo has lost a historic leader who devoted his life to protecting and promoting the rights of the people of kosovo , " solana said .
" president rugova was a man of peace , firm in the face of oppression , but deeply committed to the ideals of non-violence . " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , also paid tribute to rugova , saying in a statement that it " appreciated his work for a peaceful solution to the problems of kosovo , and encourages all leaders to continue to work in this spirit . " a " tragic moment " for kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari the united nations chief mediator in kosovo , martti ahtisaari , meanwhile offered his " deepest condolences " to rugova 's family and also called for " calm " and continued negotiations in the province . " i 'm certain that president rugova would have liked to see that we will proceed with status negotiations so that results can be achieved , " ahtisaari , a former finnish president and veteran peace broker , told a news conference in helsinki .
" i also express the hope that the situation will remain calm and that the constitution will be honored . " the un 's mission chief in kosovo said that rugova 's death came at a " tragic moment " for the province .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 21.01.2006 consumer magazine damages cup preparation efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger said the 2006 world cup stadiums are among the world 's best too much is being made of the effects a german consumer magazine report that called world cup stadiums unsafe , the tournament 's organizing committee -lrb- oc -rrb- vice-president theo zwanziger told dw-world . german consumer reports magazine stiftung warentest two weeks ago released scathing results of tests it conducted on the 12 stadiums hosting the 2006 world cup .
world cup organizers , however , call the reporting irresponsible and are demanding a correction and apology from the magazine . dw-world : do you think the oc 's public calls for an apology from stiftung warentest are a good idea ? theo zwanziger : yes , it is urgently needed .
if i spread nonsense , i have to be ready to back off .
i can not give a red card to stadiums that among the best in the world .
what does giving a red card mean ?
the red card is expulsion from the competition .
it -lrb- the magazine -rrb- has strikingly entered the scene in a way that hurts the german world cup efforts and our country . do you think that stiftung warentest is going to back pedal ? i do n't know , and it does n't matter to me .
but we have to demand it .
we are not opposed to information , help or advice . bildunterschrift : testers said kaiserslautern 's renovated stadium was unsafe in the case of mass panic the press has started saying the oc whining , is this debate helping germany 's image before the world cup ? this has absolutely nothing to do with whining .
we owe the stadium operators a degree of protection .
they went to great efforts and spent a large amount of tax money , such as in kaiserslautern , to build a great stadium .
we are not going to let anyone say it deserves a red card . moving to the cancelled opening event fifa had planned for berlin .
was the problem really with the grass ? you can not underestimate that a world cup pitch for this kind of tournament is a little different than a field near a club team somewhere .
it is completely different .
not just the way it 's used , but even the television broadcasts and a number of other things make it a very different entity .
fundamentally , it is where the world cup happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers said the gala was cancelled to protect the pitch the dutch turf laying company is saying it could replace the turf in 17 hours without a problem . we 've had these experiences before .
turf laying companies and manufactures always say that .
but we have to guarantee success under even extremely harsh weather conditions .
they do n't know what kind of weather we 're going to have when the tournament comes around . but a trimmed down version of the show is going to take place in munich , where players will take the field a few hours later . the two events have absolutely nothing to do with each other .
absolutely nothing . so no one is going to go on the field in munich ? it will be covered .
there will not be any demands made of the turf in munich as was planned for the gala in berlin . the incidents with stiftung warentest and the berlin gala cancellation have tarnished the image of the 2006 world cup .
how do you see the current mood in germany ? it is possible to clear up a tarnished image .
that is why i do n't think the image in germany has been tarnished .
once the first match has started , we 'll see the same excitement we experienced during the confederations cup in an even greater form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger is upset about damage done to the world cup 's reputation and outside of germany ? outside of germany the safety of our stadiums has been irresponsibly discredited , and that is why i am so upset about what stiftung warentest has done .
people in england , austria , switzerland and holland are rubbing their hands with glee and pointing to stiftung warentest .
but that is something stiftung warentest has to work out with them . marcus bösch interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interior ministry urges calm over world cup stadium report a german parliamentarian has said there is " no cause for panic or hysteria " in response to the consumer group stiftung warentest ’ s safety assessment of the country ’ s world cup stadiums .

19 , 2006 -rrb- world cup gala gets the ax the star-studded gala which was to open the 2006 world cup in berlin has been cancelled due to concerns over damage to the olympic stadium 's pitch .
some believe the real reason is a lack of interest and rising costs .

" the loss of president rugova comes at a particularly challenging time , " solana said in a statement .
" his wisdom and authority will be greatly missed .
at this difficult moment i call on all leaders of kosovo to show unity and responsibility .

the province has been run by the un and nato since june 1999 when the alliance 's air strikes led serbian forces under then serbian leader slobodan milosevic to withdraw from the province . the talks have now been postponed until february , un officials said . but un secretary general kofi annan said he believed rugova 's death " will not disrupt this process . " french president jacques chirac urged kosovo 's representatives to continue the negotiations in rugova 's " spirit of realism , tolerance and dialogue . " german chancellor angela merkel said rugova 's commitment to nonviolence and democracy should be " a legacy for all those who carry political responsibility in kosovo . " rugova crucial to peace talks the leadership of the charismatic kosovo leader , who was called the " gandhi of the balkan , " was considered crucial for the un-mediated negotiations . " with him kosovo has lost a historic leader who devoted his life to protecting and promoting the rights of the people of kosovo , " solana said .
" president rugova was a man of peace , firm in the face of oppression , but deeply committed to the ideals of non-violence . " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , also paid tribute to rugova , saying in a statement that it " appreciated his work for a peaceful solution to the problems of kosovo , and encourages all leaders to continue to work in this spirit . " a " tragic moment " for kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari the united nations chief mediator in kosovo , martti ahtisaari , meanwhile offered his " deepest condolences " to rugova 's family and also called for " calm " and continued negotiations in the province . " i 'm certain that president rugova would have liked to see that we will proceed with status negotiations so that results can be achieved , " ahtisaari , a former finnish president and veteran peace broker , told a news conference in helsinki .
" i also express the hope that the situation will remain calm and that the constitution will be honored . " the un 's mission chief in kosovo said that rugova 's death came at a " tragic moment " for the province . " it is particularly tragic that president rugova should leave us in this very decisive moment for the future of kosovo , " said soren jessen-petersen in a statement .
" the best tribute that we can pay to president rugova and his legacy is to stay united during the coming months . " search for replacement rugova 's death opens the difficult issue of finding a replacement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister bajram kosumi is one potential successor many analysts believe none of rugova 's likely successors possess enough of the diplomatic acumen that he had on the world stage in the ethnic albanian push for independence from serbia . rugova 's death would make " the situation more fragile because the other leaders ... have no support from their parties to take the president 's throne , " local political analyst nexhmedin spahiu recently told afp news service . " i think we will have an unpredictable phase after rugova but no unrest , " spahiu said .

" the loss of president rugova comes at a particularly challenging time , " solana said in a statement .
" his wisdom and authority will be greatly missed .
at this difficult moment i call on all leaders of kosovo to show unity and responsibility . " rugova , who became president in march 2002 , died saturday of lung cancer , aged 61 , only days ahead of the start of talks wednesday in vienna on the final status of the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops in the eastern kosovo town of vitina in 2001 while the ethnic albanians , representing 90 percent of the population , are demanding independence , belgrade is only offering broad autonomy for kosovo .
the province has been run by the un and nato since june 1999 when the alliance 's air strikes led serbian forces under then serbian leader slobodan milosevic to withdraw from the province . the talks have now been postponed until february , un officials said . but un secretary general kofi annan said he believed rugova 's death " will not disrupt this process . " french president jacques chirac urged kosovo 's representatives to continue the negotiations in rugova 's " spirit of realism , tolerance and dialogue . " german chancellor angela merkel said rugova 's commitment to nonviolence and democracy should be " a legacy for all those who carry political responsibility in kosovo . " rugova crucial to peace talks the leadership of the charismatic kosovo leader , who was called the " gandhi of the balkan , " was considered crucial for the un-mediated negotiations . " with him kosovo has lost a historic leader who devoted his life to protecting and promoting the rights of the people of kosovo , " solana said .
" president rugova was a man of peace , firm in the face of oppression , but deeply committed to the ideals of non-violence . " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , also paid tribute to rugova , saying in a statement that it " appreciated his work for a peaceful solution to the problems of kosovo , and encourages all leaders to continue to work in this spirit . " a " tragic moment " for kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari the united nations chief mediator in kosovo , martti ahtisaari , meanwhile offered his " deepest condolences " to rugova 's family and also called for " calm " and continued negotiations in the province . " i 'm certain that president rugova would have liked to see that we will proceed with status negotiations so that results can be achieved , " ahtisaari , a former finnish president and veteran peace broker , told a news conference in helsinki .
" i also express the hope that the situation will remain calm and that the constitution will be honored . " the un 's mission chief in kosovo said that rugova 's death came at a " tragic moment " for the province . " it is particularly tragic that president rugova should leave us in this very decisive moment for the future of kosovo , " said soren jessen-petersen in a statement .
" the best tribute that we can pay to president rugova and his legacy is to stay united during the coming months .

" i think we will have an unpredictable phase after rugova but no unrest , " spahiu said .

the comments appeared to flatly contradict previous reported remarks by the bank 's president . " at the moment , iran does not have any schedule to transfer its foreign exchange accounts to the named countries , " mohammad-jafar mojarad told the state news agency irna when asked if iran has transferred the accounts to asia . conflicting statements the head of the central bank , ebrahim sheibani , had reportedly said on wednesday that iran was moving funds from europe elsewhere after western demands to freeze iranian assets as a result of the conflict over iran 's decision to resume nuclear research . the international crisis over iran 's nuclear program escalated when the islamic republic resumed sensitive uranium enrichment research on jan .
10 , despite calls by european negotiators to maintain a halt to such activities . " we transfer foreign currency reserves related to all sectors including oil foreign exchanges to wherever it is good for us and we have started this transfer , " sheibani was quoted as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at an oil refinery in tehran iran is expected to earn at least $ 40 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- from oil production this year .
in the past , iran has deposited its oil revenues in european banks . sheibani himself , however , on saturday rejected the idea that such transfers had already taken place , even though he left the door open for such a possibility in the future . " we will transfer iran 's foreign accounts whenever we believe it is necessary , " sheibani told state television . us : transfer a sign of growing isolation the united states said on friday that any iranian move to transfer currency deposits away from europe would be a sign of growing isolation .
us state department spokesman sean mccormack said such market maneuvers would not deter moves to refer its nuclear activities to the un security council . " i think it is an indication that iran is further isolating itself from the rest of the world , " mccormack told a press briefing .
" i do n't know what it is that they hope to accomplish by doing this . " london , paris and berlin called an emergency meeting of the international atomic energy agency for feb .

world cup organizers , however , call the reporting irresponsible and are demanding a correction and apology from the magazine . dw-world : do you think the oc 's public calls for an apology from stiftung warentest are a good idea ? theo zwanziger : yes , it is urgently needed .
if i spread nonsense , i have to be ready to back off .
i can not give a red card to stadiums that among the best in the world .
what does giving a red card mean ?
the red card is expulsion from the competition .
it -lrb- the magazine -rrb- has strikingly entered the scene in a way that hurts the german world cup efforts and our country . do you think that stiftung warentest is going to back pedal ? i do n't know , and it does n't matter to me .
but we have to demand it .
we are not opposed to information , help or advice . bildunterschrift : testers said kaiserslautern 's renovated stadium was unsafe in the case of mass panic the press has started saying the oc whining , is this debate helping germany 's image before the world cup ? this has absolutely nothing to do with whining .
we owe the stadium operators a degree of protection .
they went to great efforts and spent a large amount of tax money , such as in kaiserslautern , to build a great stadium .
we are not going to let anyone say it deserves a red card . moving to the cancelled opening event fifa had planned for berlin .
was the problem really with the grass ? you can not underestimate that a world cup pitch for this kind of tournament is a little different than a field near a club team somewhere .
it is completely different .
not just the way it 's used , but even the television broadcasts and a number of other things make it a very different entity .
fundamentally , it is where the world cup happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers said the gala was cancelled to protect the pitch the dutch turf laying company is saying it could replace the turf in 17 hours without a problem . we 've had these experiences before .
turf laying companies and manufactures always say that .
but we have to guarantee success under even extremely harsh weather conditions .
they do n't know what kind of weather we 're going to have when the tournament comes around . but a trimmed down version of the show is going to take place in munich , where players will take the field a few hours later . the two events have absolutely nothing to do with each other .
absolutely nothing . so no one is going to go on the field in munich ? it will be covered .
there will not be any demands made of the turf in munich as was planned for the gala in berlin . the incidents with stiftung warentest and the berlin gala cancellation have tarnished the image of the 2006 world cup .
how do you see the current mood in germany ? it is possible to clear up a tarnished image .
that is why i do n't think the image in germany has been tarnished .
once the first match has started , we 'll see the same excitement we experienced during the confederations cup in an even greater form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zwanziger is upset about damage done to the world cup 's reputation and outside of germany ? outside of germany the safety of our stadiums has been irresponsibly discredited , and that is why i am so upset about what stiftung warentest has done .
people in england , austria , switzerland and holland are rubbing their hands with glee and pointing to stiftung warentest .
but that is something stiftung warentest has to work out with them . marcus bösch interviewed theo zwanziger -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interior ministry urges calm over world cup stadium report a german parliamentarian has said there is " no cause for panic or hysteria " in response to the consumer group stiftung warentest ’ s safety assessment of the country ’ s world cup stadiums .

" the loss of president rugova comes at a particularly challenging time , " solana said in a statement .
" his wisdom and authority will be greatly missed .
at this difficult moment i call on all leaders of kosovo to show unity and responsibility .

" i also express the hope that the situation will remain calm and that the constitution will be honored .

" the loss of president rugova comes at a particularly challenging time , " solana said in a statement .
" his wisdom and authority will be greatly missed .
at this difficult moment i call on all leaders of kosovo to show unity and responsibility . " rugova , who became president in march 2002 , died saturday of lung cancer , aged 61 , only days ahead of the start of talks wednesday in vienna on the final status of the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops in the eastern kosovo town of vitina in 2001 while the ethnic albanians , representing 90 percent of the population , are demanding independence , belgrade is only offering broad autonomy for kosovo .
the province has been run by the un and nato since june 1999 when the alliance 's air strikes led serbian forces under then serbian leader slobodan milosevic to withdraw from the province . the talks have now been postponed until february , un officials said . but un secretary general kofi annan said he believed rugova 's death " will not disrupt this process . " french president jacques chirac urged kosovo 's representatives to continue the negotiations in rugova 's " spirit of realism , tolerance and dialogue . " german chancellor angela merkel said rugova 's commitment to nonviolence and democracy should be " a legacy for all those who carry political responsibility in kosovo . " rugova crucial to peace talks the leadership of the charismatic kosovo leader , who was called the " gandhi of the balkan , " was considered crucial for the un-mediated negotiations . " with him kosovo has lost a historic leader who devoted his life to protecting and promoting the rights of the people of kosovo , " solana said .
" president rugova was a man of peace , firm in the face of oppression , but deeply committed to the ideals of non-violence . " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , also paid tribute to rugova , saying in a statement that it " appreciated his work for a peaceful solution to the problems of kosovo , and encourages all leaders to continue to work in this spirit . " a " tragic moment " for kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martti ahtisaari the united nations chief mediator in kosovo , martti ahtisaari , meanwhile offered his " deepest condolences " to rugova 's family and also called for " calm " and continued negotiations in the province . " i 'm certain that president rugova would have liked to see that we will proceed with status negotiations so that results can be achieved , " ahtisaari , a former finnish president and veteran peace broker , told a news conference in helsinki .
" i also express the hope that the situation will remain calm and that the constitution will be honored . " the un 's mission chief in kosovo said that rugova 's death came at a " tragic moment " for the province . " it is particularly tragic that president rugova should leave us in this very decisive moment for the future of kosovo , " said soren jessen-petersen in a statement .
" the best tribute that we can pay to president rugova and his legacy is to stay united during the coming months . " search for replacement rugova 's death opens the difficult issue of finding a replacement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister bajram kosumi is one potential successor many analysts believe none of rugova 's likely successors possess enough of the diplomatic acumen that he had on the world stage in the ethnic albanian push for independence from serbia . rugova 's death would make " the situation more fragile because the other leaders ... have no support from their parties to take the president 's throne , " local political analyst nexhmedin spahiu recently told afp news service . " i think we will have an unpredictable phase after rugova but no unrest , " spahiu said .

8 , calling for pay increases of 5 percent for the 3.4 million workers in industries ranging from cars to semi-conductors . the engineering and metalworking sectors are among the biggest and most important in germany and any deal there acts as a benchmark for other sectors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall represents germany 's engineering and metalworking sectors true to the traditional sabre-rattling that accompanies the negotiations , employers had already dismissed ig metall 's demands as excessive , irresponsible and impossible to finance . the employers federation gesamtmetall , which had said in december that pay increases of more than 1.2 percent would be unacceptable , complained that german companies already faced the highest labor costs among all their competitors . job exodus ? pushing those costs up even further would simply drive more jobs abroad , said federation chief martin kannegiesser . the head of the bvmw federation of mid-sized companies , mario ohoven , also warned of a " large-scale exodus of german jobs . " the head of the bda employers ' federation , dieter hundt , slammed ig metall 's demands as " irresponsible , " saying they sent the " wrong signal . " but ig metall argued that " wages equal purchasing power and wage increases revitalize the economy . " " our demands are affordable , " said ig metall chief jürgen peters .
" measured as a proportion of sales , companies have never paid so little for wages as they do now , " peters said . after years of merciless belt-tightening , unions insist employees must now get a piece of the cake . while unions accepted longer working hours and near-zero wage rounds in the past in return for safeguarding jobs in germany , companies have continued to slash jobs mercilessly , even as profits soared to record levels . nascent economic recovery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bda 's dieter hundt said ig metall is sending the wrong signal and with the euro zone 's biggest economy finally seeming to have turned the corner , they see higher wages as the way to kick-start sluggish domestic demand , which has long been the main hurdle to self-sustaining economic recovery . but employers refuse to accept such arguments , countering that two thirds of jobs in the engineering and metalworking sectors depend on exports , so that even if german consumers had more cash in their pocket , they were unlikely to spend it on german-made goods . with both sides prepared to dig their heels in , the coming months could turn into a winter of discontent in germany . traditionally , there is a four-week truce while wage talks are ongoing , forbidding any industrial action .
but if no agreement is reached by then , strikes might be on the agenda . a foretaste came on friday when workers at the nuremberg plant of electrical appliance maker aeg went on indefinite strike in protest against plans by the group 's swedish parent to shut down the factory . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , nation of reluctant strikers german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .

the legendary 1965 db5 model , complete with a host of high-tech gadgets , went under the hammer in phoenix , arizona .
driven by sean connery , the car boasts built-in browning machine guns , tyre slashers , an oil slick ejector and a retractable rear bullet-proof screen .
it was bought for $ 2,090,000 by a european collector .
when last sold in 1970 , it fetched £ 5,000 .
' so exciting ' before the sale began , lights in the auction house were turned off and rm auctions spokesman terrance lobzun - dressed in 007-style tuxedo - drove the car on to the stage .
he demonstrated all the features - including the guns - in return for a standing ovation from the audience .
" it was just amazing .
the atmosphere was electric , it was so exciting , " he said .
" every seat of the 1,500 in the house was sold - it was standing room only .
it was the biggest crowd we 've ever had .
" if there had been real bullets in the guns i would have taken out the whole front row of these people who have more money than most countries do . "
' quite happy ' mr lobzun added : " needless to say the previous owner is quite happy with his investment . "
the car had been bought from sir anthony bamford in 1970 by a tennessee museum owner .
other gadgets include three revolving number plates including the registrations 007jb and jb007 .

the aston martin was one of only four cars originally constructed and used for 1964 's goldfinger and 1965 's thunderball , as well as on promotional tours .
the price included the buyer 's premium .

professor john bourne said a cull could worsen england 's bovine tb situation , adding ministers had underestimated the level of culling required .
conservationists say cattle movements are to blame for spreading the disease .
most farmers say a cull is needed but disagree with government proposals , saying they do not go far enough .
a consultation was launched after ministers said tb was at crisis point .
' aggressive approach ' more than £ 90m was spent on battling bovine tb last year but the debate still rages over how to tackle the disease . "
we 're not going to go along with partial control that could make the situation worse " anthony gibson national farmers ' union prof bourne has now made public his doubts over cull proposals on bbc radio 4 's farming today programme .
he said : " there does need to be a far more aggressive focus on the cattle problem before one is going to see any decrease in the instance of the disease .
" there 's no doubt in my mind that this would be achievable if there was concerted effort between farmers and government to more aggressively control the disease in cattle . "
effective cull anthony gibson , who heads the nation farmers ' union in south-west england , also said government plans could make the situation worse . "
culling badgers certainly wo n't make the situation better " dr arthur lindley rscpa he said farmers would refuse to take responsibility for snaring and shooting the animals , saying government scientists should gas them .
" we are keen on culling providing it is effective culling - to be effective it has got to involve the gassing of infected sets .
" we 're not going to go along with partial control that could make the situation worse . "
he claimed the government would not authorise the use of gas on badgers for at least another year .
' enormous suffering ' but animal groups deny the necessity of culling the animals at all .
dr arthur lindley , of the rspca , said scientific evidence showed a cull of badgers was " inappropriate " .
" it certainly wo n't make the situation better , may well make the situation worse , and will involve enormous suffering . "
he called for tighter controls on the movement of cattle and better testing of the animals .
the department of environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- said it would welcome all opinions as part of its consultation .
badger culling was just one of the proposals put forward by the government when it launched the consultation in december .

howard bowcott has created a 5.5m -lrb- 20ft -rrb- sculpture from slate and sandstone which will travel to its new home in pieces .
mr bowcott , from penrhyndeudraeth , near porthmadog , has travelled up and down the a470 twice a week to ensure community involvement in his work .
the 49-year-old artist created the sculpture from slate and sandstone the piece was commissioned by ammanford town council and the arts council for wales , with the backing of artwork wales .
it followed his success with another project in south wales - the chepstow high street regeneration scheme . "
local people have had a hand in making it , there is a sense of ownership " howard bowcott , artist the brief was to produce a work that was not a literal depiction of a miner or mine .
" my inspiration was a geological slice through the strata where you would come across a seam of coal , " said the artist .
two columns made up of " slices " of slate and sandstone make up the work .
polished slate has been used to represent the coal seam because coal would be too soft .
poet einir jones , a teacher who lives in ammanford , has worked closely on the piece , sourcing and including the work of local people .
mr bowcott has other projects in the pipeline in abergavenny and pontypridd following on from ammanford and has been commissioned to create a slate sculpture near the new bridge being built in holyhead ..
mr bowcott said : " i would like to do more of this kind of work and i 'd like to see more initiative being taken by councils in north wales too .
" it 's not a mater of money because european funding is available , its a matter of taking the initiative .
" art does n't have to be a one-off piece , it can be used on paving , benches , -lrb- and -rrb- walls .
" it is important to maintain it afterwards of course , but none of my work has been vandalised , local people have had a hand in making it , there is a sense of ownership , " he added .

howard bowcott has created a 5.5m -lrb- 20ft -rrb- sculpture from slate and sandstone which will travel to its new home in pieces .
mr bowcott , from penrhyndeudraeth , near porthmadog , has travelled up and down the a470 twice a week to ensure community involvement in his work .
the 49-year-old artist created the sculpture from slate and sandstone the piece was commissioned by ammanford town council and the arts council for wales , with the backing of artwork wales .
it followed his success with another project in south wales - the chepstow high street regeneration scheme .
local people have had a hand in making it , there is a sense of ownership howard bowcott , artist the brief was to produce a work that was not a literal depiction of a miner or mine .
" my inspiration was a geological slice through the strata where you would come across a seam of coal , " said the artist .
two columns made up of " slices " of slate and sandstone make up the work .
polished slate has been used to represent the coal seam because coal would be too soft .
poet einir jones , a teacher who lives in ammanford , has worked closely on the piece , sourcing and including the work of local people .
mr bowcott has other projects in the pipeline in abergavenny and pontypridd following on from ammanford and has been commissioned to create a slate sculpture near the new bridge being built in holyhead ..
howard bowcott during the early stages of construction mr bowcott said : " i would like to do more of this kind of work and i 'd like to see more initiative being taken by councils in north wales too .
" it 's not a mater of money because european funding is available , its a matter of taking the initiative .
" art does n't have to be a one-off piece , it can be used on paving , benches , -lrb- and -rrb- walls .
" it is important to maintain it afterwards of course , but none of my work has been vandalised , local people have had a hand in making it , there is a sense of ownership , " he added .

a number of cities , including coventry , are competing against each for the right to host the casino .
the city council along with 19 other local authorities wants the government to go back to its original plan to allow eight to be built .
they signed a joint statement to have the number of casino licenses restored .
coventry is currently competing with birmingham , blackpool and glasgow among others for the sole right to have a super casino .
such competition could limit the city 's hopes of building a casino as part of the ricoh arena complex which would create up to 5,000 jobs .
john mcguigan , director of city development for coventry , said the letter places further pressure on the government to rethink its decision .
