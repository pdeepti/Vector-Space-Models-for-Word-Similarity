members of a german-lebanese family were reportedly killed in israeli strikes . foreigners were advised to evacuate lebanon and suspend all travel to the country as israeli forces pounded suspected hezbollah strongholds there for the fourth day , raising fears of full-scale war . france , germany , greece , the philippines , spain and the united states were among those which issued warnings to their citizens either living in the conflict zone or planning trips there amid the escalating violence . newspaper : german-lebanese family killed a german newspaper reported in its saturday edition that three members of a german-lebanese family were killed and one wounded in the israeli offensive on lebanon . the süddeutsche zeitung quoted raef khachab , a businessman from munich , as saying his 43-year-old cousin , his pregnant wife and their teenage daughter died in an israeli air raid in southern lebanon on thursday morning when rockets struck the home of relatives they were visiting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge as it is targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon khachab said the family 's 11-year-old son was injured in the attack on shour , a village near the main coastal city of tyre , and had been hospitalized .
he said his cousin was a naturalized german citizen who settled in the country 25 years ago .
the family lived in mönchengladbach in western germany . according to lebanese police , five civilians were killed in shour on thursday morning when israeli planes bombed villages and towns in southern lebanon . german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger on friday said the government was trying to verify the information . " there are indications that a german-lebanese family could be among the victims .
the embassy in beirut is in close contact with lebanese officials and we are trying to establish the facts . " governments issue travel warnings with no sign of a lull in the attacks , the german foreign ministry warned citizens not to travel to lebanon , the palestinian territories or any of israel 's border regions , saying " the situation is very insecure .

about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war .

israeli attacks have left lebanon virtually cut off from the outside world , targeting the southern suburbs of beirut , the country 's only international airport as well as bridges and roads across the south of the country . " keep a low profile " the us state department warned americans against traveling to lebanon , authorized embassy personnel and their families to evacuate and advised other us citizens there to " keep a low profile . " the state department estimates that about 25,000 us citizens , including people with dual citizenship , live in lebanon , although summer visits could expand that community . greece and spain too have said they were evacuating their nationals from lebanon .
the french government said it was preparing to evacuate its embassy in lebanon and recommended citizens to avoid all travel to the country .
a special hotline has been set up for people with relatives in lebanon , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut is home to thousands of foreign expatriates lebanon is a former french colony and many french citizens have business and family ties with the country .
up to 5,000 french tourists are believed to be in lebanon in addition to about 17,000 french residents who are registered with the consular service there . tensions in germany over events as israeli planes blasted roads and bridges in south , east and north lebanon on saturday , a day after hezbollah 's chief declared open war on israel for a blitz launched in reprisal for the capture of two israeli soldiers , international condemnation intensified . the european union still remains divided on the issue , with members such as france and finland slamming the israeli reaction as " completely disproportionate . " the israeli offensive in lebanon has also led to political tensions within germany .
members of the country 's central council of jews have accused german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of " apparently using double standards . " steinmeier had earlier said that he understood that every country had the right to defend itself if attacked .
at the same time he said that israel had to show a measured response to the kidnapping of israeli soldiers by the hezbollah . steinmeier later told zdf television that israel 's targeting of lebanese infrastructure was not a " necessary reaction . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany warned against one-sided condemnations of israel .

the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war . " the losses are massive .
it 's too early to give numbers but everything is pointing to very serious losses , " tourism minister joseph sarkis told reuters .

unfortunately , the season has been hit . " bildunterschrift : over 60 civilians have been killed since israel launched a bitter offensive on its northern neighbor on wednesday after hezbollah militia captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight .

up to 5,000 french tourists are believed to be in lebanon in addition to about 17,000 french residents who are registered with the consular service there . tensions in germany over events as israeli planes blasted roads and bridges in south , east and north lebanon on saturday , a day after hezbollah 's chief declared open war on israel for a blitz launched in reprisal for the capture of two israeli soldiers , international condemnation intensified . the european union still remains divided on the issue , with members such as france and finland slamming the israeli reaction as " completely disproportionate . " the israeli offensive in lebanon has also led to political tensions within germany .
members of the country 's central council of jews have accused german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of " apparently using double standards . " steinmeier had earlier said that he understood that every country had the right to defend itself if attacked .
at the same time he said that israel had to show a measured response to the kidnapping of israeli soldiers by the hezbollah . steinmeier later told zdf television that israel 's targeting of lebanese infrastructure was not a " necessary reaction . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany warned against one-sided condemnations of israel .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict . " " on the one hand , the capture of prisoners and shelling the territory of another state is absolutely unacceptable , " ivanov said , referring to the shiite hezbollah militia in lebanon . " on the other hand , the use of military force on such a scale and against such targets i think is also unacceptable , or at least disproportionate , " he added , referring this time to israel . " whether we like it or not the only way of resolving this very difficult situation is to return to the negotiating table , " ivanov said . " summit should n't be a talking shop " germany called for a halt to the spiraling violence with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier calling on " all concerned parties in the region to take an active part in de-escalation , " according to a ministry statement , after a telephone conversation with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . according to an edition of news magazine der spiegel due to appear monday , germany is actively involved in the search for peace at the request of several western states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel use her influence with israel at the request of bush ?
it claims that berlin , through chancellor angela merkel , had sought to use its influence with israel at the request of president george w. bush . " the implications are very serious and we need to assess it with urgency , " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman warned . " this -lrb- summit -rrb- should n't be a talking shop .
it should be setting an agenda which will help de-escalate the situation . " israel 's offensive was launched three weeks ago in gaza and this week in lebanon to secure the release of three soldiers seized by militant groups and to halt their rocket attacks on the jewish state . the military campaign has left more than 90 dead in lebanon alone as well as scores in gaza and brought widespread international condemnation . bush , putin clash over democracy , wto meanwhile bush also clashed with putin over democratic reforms , an issue he had promised to raise here . pressing issues like a free press and religion , he proposed war-torn iraq could be a model for moscow .
" i told him that a lot of people in our country would hope russia would do the same thing , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin clashed over democracy to which putin retorted , to laughter : " we certainly would not want to have the same kind of democracy as they have in iraq . " " just wait , " bush replied . separately , russian and us negotiators failed despite intensive talks here to overcome lingering obstacles to a bilateral accord enabling moscow to join the wto , which sets global trade rules . bush said washington supported moscow 's 13-year quest to join the wto and a deal was " almost reached " but " there 's more work to be done . " putin admitted the difficulties , saying national interests were at stake . " i ca n't say that we were not expecting such a complication , " he said .
" we will continue to work , defending our interests and the interests of our growing economy . " russia is currently the only major power operating outside wto trade rules , and agreement here would have confirmed its rising status as a commercial and economic powerhouse . russia and the united states adopted what a us official billed as a global initiative against nuclear terrorism , a control and monitoring mechanism aimed at keeping atomic materials out of the hands of extremists . russia cracks down on protestors meanwhile russian riot police broke up a planned march by communist activists saturday protesting against the summit of g8 world leaders in saint petersburg . around 100 communists gathered in the centre of the former tsarist capital despite a ban on any rallies during the summit , which ends monday.eventually they were allowed to hold a meeting in a site four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- away but were refused permission to unfurl any banners or chant slogans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against the g8 summit clash with riot police riot police intervened when some of the activists tried to demonstrate on the street , causing scuffles which led to the arrest of at least 10 people . among slogans which could be heard were " g8 outlaws " and " world without g8 , russia without putin , " referring to russian president vladimir putin . valentin romanov , a communist deputy in the russian parliament , criticized the ban on the rally as excessive . " you have to take security measures but you also have to respect people .
these security measures are excessive when the summit is taking place outside saint petersburg . " the tight security measures for the g8 club 's annual summit have also led to a clampdown on anti-globalization protesters who have been confined to a stadium far from the event . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de governments warn citizens to stay clear of lebanon amid spiraling mideast violence , several governments , including germany 's , have warned their nationals to stay away from lebanon .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .
members and followers recruited the new organization from the amal movement - the traditional but economically bankrupt political party representing the shia community , lebanon 's largest religious bloc . the iranian dream it 's significant that hezbollah was founded during a meeting at the iranian embassy in beirut .
iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .
violent exchanges , on the other hand , keep the conflict simmering .
they claim new victims , fortify the fronts , and strengthen the resolve on both sides . syria and iran have used hezbollah to set a trap for israel - and without great foresight , israel has fallen into it .
those who demand violent solutions can not truly have an interest in peace . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : israel uses " disproportionate force " in lebanon the worsening situation in the middle east has captured the world 's attention , including the european union 's , which has accused israel of " disproportionate use of force " in lebanon .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict .

" on the other hand , the use of military force on such a scale and against such targets i think is also unacceptable , or at least disproportionate , " he added , referring this time to israel . " whether we like it or not the only way of resolving this very difficult situation is to return to the negotiating table , " ivanov said . " summit should n't be a talking shop " germany called for a halt to the spiraling violence with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier calling on " all concerned parties in the region to take an active part in de-escalation , " according to a ministry statement , after a telephone conversation with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . according to an edition of news magazine der spiegel due to appear monday , germany is actively involved in the search for peace at the request of several western states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel use her influence with israel at the request of bush ?
it claims that berlin , through chancellor angela merkel , had sought to use its influence with israel at the request of president george w. bush . " the implications are very serious and we need to assess it with urgency , " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman warned . " this -lrb- summit -rrb- should n't be a talking shop .
it should be setting an agenda which will help de-escalate the situation . " israel 's offensive was launched three weeks ago in gaza and this week in lebanon to secure the release of three soldiers seized by militant groups and to halt their rocket attacks on the jewish state . the military campaign has left more than 90 dead in lebanon alone as well as scores in gaza and brought widespread international condemnation . bush , putin clash over democracy , wto meanwhile bush also clashed with putin over democratic reforms , an issue he had promised to raise here . pressing issues like a free press and religion , he proposed war-torn iraq could be a model for moscow .
" i told him that a lot of people in our country would hope russia would do the same thing , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin clashed over democracy to which putin retorted , to laughter : " we certainly would not want to have the same kind of democracy as they have in iraq . " " just wait , " bush replied . separately , russian and us negotiators failed despite intensive talks here to overcome lingering obstacles to a bilateral accord enabling moscow to join the wto , which sets global trade rules . bush said washington supported moscow 's 13-year quest to join the wto and a deal was " almost reached " but " there 's more work to be done . " putin admitted the difficulties , saying national interests were at stake . " i ca n't say that we were not expecting such a complication , " he said .
" we will continue to work , defending our interests and the interests of our growing economy . " russia is currently the only major power operating outside wto trade rules , and agreement here would have confirmed its rising status as a commercial and economic powerhouse . russia and the united states adopted what a us official billed as a global initiative against nuclear terrorism , a control and monitoring mechanism aimed at keeping atomic materials out of the hands of extremists . russia cracks down on protestors meanwhile russian riot police broke up a planned march by communist activists saturday protesting against the summit of g8 world leaders in saint petersburg . around 100 communists gathered in the centre of the former tsarist capital despite a ban on any rallies during the summit , which ends monday.eventually they were allowed to hold a meeting in a site four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- away but were refused permission to unfurl any banners or chant slogans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against the g8 summit clash with riot police riot police intervened when some of the activists tried to demonstrate on the street , causing scuffles which led to the arrest of at least 10 people . among slogans which could be heard were " g8 outlaws " and " world without g8 , russia without putin , " referring to russian president vladimir putin . valentin romanov , a communist deputy in the russian parliament , criticized the ban on the rally as excessive .

" we will continue to work , defending our interests and the interests of our growing economy .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict .

" on the other hand , the use of military force on such a scale and against such targets i think is also unacceptable , or at least disproportionate , " he added , referring this time to israel .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .
members and followers recruited the new organization from the amal movement - the traditional but economically bankrupt political party representing the shia community , lebanon 's largest religious bloc . the iranian dream it 's significant that hezbollah was founded during a meeting at the iranian embassy in beirut .
iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .
violent exchanges , on the other hand , keep the conflict simmering .
they claim new victims , fortify the fronts , and strengthen the resolve on both sides . syria and iran have used hezbollah to set a trap for israel - and without great foresight , israel has fallen into it .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .

iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .

members of a german-lebanese family were reportedly killed in israeli strikes . foreigners were advised to evacuate lebanon and suspend all travel to the country as israeli forces pounded suspected hezbollah strongholds there for the fourth day , raising fears of full-scale war . france , germany , greece , the philippines , spain and the united states were among those which issued warnings to their citizens either living in the conflict zone or planning trips there amid the escalating violence . newspaper : german-lebanese family killed a german newspaper reported in its saturday edition that three members of a german-lebanese family were killed and one wounded in the israeli offensive on lebanon . the süddeutsche zeitung quoted raef khachab , a businessman from munich , as saying his 43-year-old cousin , his pregnant wife and their teenage daughter died in an israeli air raid in southern lebanon on thursday morning when rockets struck the home of relatives they were visiting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge as it is targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon khachab said the family 's 11-year-old son was injured in the attack on shour , a village near the main coastal city of tyre , and had been hospitalized .
he said his cousin was a naturalized german citizen who settled in the country 25 years ago .
the family lived in mönchengladbach in western germany . according to lebanese police , five civilians were killed in shour on thursday morning when israeli planes bombed villages and towns in southern lebanon . german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger on friday said the government was trying to verify the information . " there are indications that a german-lebanese family could be among the victims .
the embassy in beirut is in close contact with lebanese officials and we are trying to establish the facts . " governments issue travel warnings with no sign of a lull in the attacks , the german foreign ministry warned citizens not to travel to lebanon , the palestinian territories or any of israel 's border regions , saying " the situation is very insecure . " there are about 1,100 germans living in lebanon , according to the ministry .
about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war . " the losses are massive .
it 's too early to give numbers but everything is pointing to very serious losses , " tourism minister joseph sarkis told reuters .
" it was shaping up to be a very good summer season ...
unfortunately , the season has been hit . " bildunterschrift : over 60 civilians have been killed since israel launched a bitter offensive on its northern neighbor on wednesday after hezbollah militia captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight .
israeli attacks have left lebanon virtually cut off from the outside world , targeting the southern suburbs of beirut , the country 's only international airport as well as bridges and roads across the south of the country . " keep a low profile " the us state department warned americans against traveling to lebanon , authorized embassy personnel and their families to evacuate and advised other us citizens there to " keep a low profile . " the state department estimates that about 25,000 us citizens , including people with dual citizenship , live in lebanon , although summer visits could expand that community . greece and spain too have said they were evacuating their nationals from lebanon .
the french government said it was preparing to evacuate its embassy in lebanon and recommended citizens to avoid all travel to the country .
a special hotline has been set up for people with relatives in lebanon , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut is home to thousands of foreign expatriates lebanon is a former french colony and many french citizens have business and family ties with the country .
up to 5,000 french tourists are believed to be in lebanon in addition to about 17,000 french residents who are registered with the consular service there . tensions in germany over events as israeli planes blasted roads and bridges in south , east and north lebanon on saturday , a day after hezbollah 's chief declared open war on israel for a blitz launched in reprisal for the capture of two israeli soldiers , international condemnation intensified . the european union still remains divided on the issue , with members such as france and finland slamming the israeli reaction as " completely disproportionate . " the israeli offensive in lebanon has also led to political tensions within germany .
members of the country 's central council of jews have accused german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of " apparently using double standards . " steinmeier had earlier said that he understood that every country had the right to defend itself if attacked .
at the same time he said that israel had to show a measured response to the kidnapping of israeli soldiers by the hezbollah . steinmeier later told zdf television that israel 's targeting of lebanese infrastructure was not a " necessary reaction . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany warned against one-sided condemnations of israel . " it would help some politicians if they tried to imagine how it would be if germany was under daily rocket attack , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " israel was massively provoked " german historian michael stürmer talked to dw-world.de about israel 's motivations behind the attacks on hezbollah strongholds in lebanon , the background of the conflict , and what the recent crisis could mean for germany .

" no , we were n't here for the football .
we came for this .
we are a bit bedazzled .
there is nothing this big back home , " said dale harwick , a horticulturist from melbourne , australia seeking shade under a tree . " mate , at eight o 'clock all the floats go up to the front and they all make music together .
the top comes off , " he explained . " the love is back " the love parade dates back to 1989 , the year the berlin wall fell . the first time it drew 150 people but in following years the numbers exploded as post-communist berlin became a cool destination for young travelers from all over and the techno music trend for marathon dance parties swept the world . in 1999 , 1.5 million paraders packed out central berlin for 24 hours of dancing and kindness among strangers but in recent years the shine wore off as revelers complained that it had become an increasingly commercial event . for the past two years , the parade was canceled for lack of funding .
it returned this year under the title " the love is back " after the owner of a chain of fitness clubs put up two million euros -lrb- 2.5 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship . " drugs have no place at the parade " this time the parade also aimed to change its image of revelers tripped out on ecstasy with hard alcohol beverages in hand . instead , participants were given glucose candy to keep up the energy levels and handed non-alcoholic beverages to lower the possibility of accidents . the main sponsor , rainer schaller said that " drugs have no place at the parade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical love parade scene die-hard fans said they had sorely missed the event and were happy to drive across europe to come back .
" it 's my fourth time .
it is beautiful to see so many people all do the same thing , " said martin haas , one of a group of dutch students all dressed up in roman togas for the party .
they stood out for being so classical , surrounded by a sea of girls wearing leopard print underwear and pigtails or plastic flowers in their hair and tattoos everywhere .
a few german girls coolly ignored the thumping beat in identical t-shirts proclaiming " no pictures please . " " it is pure provocation .
everybody talks to us and takes lots of pictures , " laughed anite breuer , a bank clerk from the western city of cologne . love parade veteran henrik schrage , a bar owner from osnabrück also in western germany , said it was the eighth year he had come to the party but remarked that it was off to a worryingly slow start .
by early evening however , organisers said they had hit the million mark as a human tide stretched all the way from the brandenburg gate to the 19th century victory column monument . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin fan mile beats oktoberfest in popularity contest with its world cup fan mile , berlin gave munich 's oktoberfest a run for its money in the stakes as the ultimate party draw - and won , say officials from the german tourism office .

" no , we were n't here for the football .
we came for this .
we are a bit bedazzled .
there is nothing this big back home , " said dale harwick , a horticulturist from melbourne , australia seeking shade under a tree . " mate , at eight o 'clock all the floats go up to the front and they all make music together .
the top comes off , " he explained . " the love is back " the love parade dates back to 1989 , the year the berlin wall fell . the first time it drew 150 people but in following years the numbers exploded as post-communist berlin became a cool destination for young travelers from all over and the techno music trend for marathon dance parties swept the world . in 1999 , 1.5 million paraders packed out central berlin for 24 hours of dancing and kindness among strangers but in recent years the shine wore off as revelers complained that it had become an increasingly commercial event . for the past two years , the parade was canceled for lack of funding .
it returned this year under the title " the love is back " after the owner of a chain of fitness clubs put up two million euros -lrb- 2.5 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship . " drugs have no place at the parade " this time the parade also aimed to change its image of revelers tripped out on ecstasy with hard alcohol beverages in hand . instead , participants were given glucose candy to keep up the energy levels and handed non-alcoholic beverages to lower the possibility of accidents . the main sponsor , rainer schaller said that " drugs have no place at the parade .

members of a german-lebanese family were reportedly killed in israeli strikes . foreigners were advised to evacuate lebanon and suspend all travel to the country as israeli forces pounded suspected hezbollah strongholds there for the fourth day , raising fears of full-scale war . france , germany , greece , the philippines , spain and the united states were among those which issued warnings to their citizens either living in the conflict zone or planning trips there amid the escalating violence . newspaper : german-lebanese family killed a german newspaper reported in its saturday edition that three members of a german-lebanese family were killed and one wounded in the israeli offensive on lebanon . the süddeutsche zeitung quoted raef khachab , a businessman from munich , as saying his 43-year-old cousin , his pregnant wife and their teenage daughter died in an israeli air raid in southern lebanon on thursday morning when rockets struck the home of relatives they were visiting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge as it is targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon khachab said the family 's 11-year-old son was injured in the attack on shour , a village near the main coastal city of tyre , and had been hospitalized .
he said his cousin was a naturalized german citizen who settled in the country 25 years ago .
the family lived in mönchengladbach in western germany . according to lebanese police , five civilians were killed in shour on thursday morning when israeli planes bombed villages and towns in southern lebanon . german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger on friday said the government was trying to verify the information . " there are indications that a german-lebanese family could be among the victims .
the embassy in beirut is in close contact with lebanese officials and we are trying to establish the facts . " governments issue travel warnings with no sign of a lull in the attacks , the german foreign ministry warned citizens not to travel to lebanon , the palestinian territories or any of israel 's border regions , saying " the situation is very insecure . " there are about 1,100 germans living in lebanon , according to the ministry .
about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war . " the losses are massive .
it 's too early to give numbers but everything is pointing to very serious losses , " tourism minister joseph sarkis told reuters .
" it was shaping up to be a very good summer season ...
unfortunately , the season has been hit . " bildunterschrift : over 60 civilians have been killed since israel launched a bitter offensive on its northern neighbor on wednesday after hezbollah militia captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight .
israeli attacks have left lebanon virtually cut off from the outside world , targeting the southern suburbs of beirut , the country 's only international airport as well as bridges and roads across the south of the country . " keep a low profile " the us state department warned americans against traveling to lebanon , authorized embassy personnel and their families to evacuate and advised other us citizens there to " keep a low profile . " the state department estimates that about 25,000 us citizens , including people with dual citizenship , live in lebanon , although summer visits could expand that community . greece and spain too have said they were evacuating their nationals from lebanon .
the french government said it was preparing to evacuate its embassy in lebanon and recommended citizens to avoid all travel to the country .
a special hotline has been set up for people with relatives in lebanon , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut is home to thousands of foreign expatriates lebanon is a former french colony and many french citizens have business and family ties with the country .
up to 5,000 french tourists are believed to be in lebanon in addition to about 17,000 french residents who are registered with the consular service there . tensions in germany over events as israeli planes blasted roads and bridges in south , east and north lebanon on saturday , a day after hezbollah 's chief declared open war on israel for a blitz launched in reprisal for the capture of two israeli soldiers , international condemnation intensified . the european union still remains divided on the issue , with members such as france and finland slamming the israeli reaction as " completely disproportionate . " the israeli offensive in lebanon has also led to political tensions within germany .
members of the country 's central council of jews have accused german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of " apparently using double standards . " steinmeier had earlier said that he understood that every country had the right to defend itself if attacked .
at the same time he said that israel had to show a measured response to the kidnapping of israeli soldiers by the hezbollah . steinmeier later told zdf television that israel 's targeting of lebanese infrastructure was not a " necessary reaction . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany warned against one-sided condemnations of israel . " it would help some politicians if they tried to imagine how it would be if germany was under daily rocket attack , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " israel was massively provoked " german historian michael stürmer talked to dw-world.de about israel 's motivations behind the attacks on hezbollah strongholds in lebanon , the background of the conflict , and what the recent crisis could mean for germany .

about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict . " " on the one hand , the capture of prisoners and shelling the territory of another state is absolutely unacceptable , " ivanov said , referring to the shiite hezbollah militia in lebanon . " on the other hand , the use of military force on such a scale and against such targets i think is also unacceptable , or at least disproportionate , " he added , referring this time to israel . " whether we like it or not the only way of resolving this very difficult situation is to return to the negotiating table , " ivanov said . " summit should n't be a talking shop " germany called for a halt to the spiraling violence with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier calling on " all concerned parties in the region to take an active part in de-escalation , " according to a ministry statement , after a telephone conversation with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . according to an edition of news magazine der spiegel due to appear monday , germany is actively involved in the search for peace at the request of several western states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel use her influence with israel at the request of bush ?

" the implications are very serious and we need to assess it with urgency , " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman warned . " this -lrb- summit -rrb- should n't be a talking shop .
it should be setting an agenda which will help de-escalate the situation . " israel 's offensive was launched three weeks ago in gaza and this week in lebanon to secure the release of three soldiers seized by militant groups and to halt their rocket attacks on the jewish state . the military campaign has left more than 90 dead in lebanon alone as well as scores in gaza and brought widespread international condemnation . bush , putin clash over democracy , wto meanwhile bush also clashed with putin over democratic reforms , an issue he had promised to raise here . pressing issues like a free press and religion , he proposed war-torn iraq could be a model for moscow .
" i told him that a lot of people in our country would hope russia would do the same thing , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin clashed over democracy to which putin retorted , to laughter : " we certainly would not want to have the same kind of democracy as they have in iraq . " " just wait , " bush replied . separately , russian and us negotiators failed despite intensive talks here to overcome lingering obstacles to a bilateral accord enabling moscow to join the wto , which sets global trade rules . bush said washington supported moscow 's 13-year quest to join the wto and a deal was " almost reached " but " there 's more work to be done . " putin admitted the difficulties , saying national interests were at stake . " i ca n't say that we were not expecting such a complication , " he said .
" we will continue to work , defending our interests and the interests of our growing economy .

dw-world.de interviewed valentina matviyenko , mayor of president putin 's multi-cultural hometown . dw-world.de : which problems will be discussed during the s ummit ?
what will russia 's contribution look like , concerning issues like global energy security and viral epidemics , for example ? valentina matviyenko : generally , topics brought up at g8 summits are relevant for the world population .
you mentioned some of them already .
of course , russia wo n't just stand around and play the host .
as the state that holds the g8 presidency this year , we are preparing our proposals for all of the issues on the table .
i ca n't tell you what the proposals are yet . as far as energy security is concerned , russia - as a major distributor of energy - has the right to act as a trendsetter in this area and offer suggestions that will later be practically implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentina matviyenko st. petersburg has always wrestled with moscow over being the capital city .
has the city at least become a cultural , financial or commercial - if not political - capital city since putin took office ? vladimir putin was born in st. petersburg .
no one else understands the role st. petersburg has played in the country , historically and today , like he does .
that 's why the city has had so many problems making its enormous economic , scientific and educational potential attractive for russia .
naturally , putin sees st. petersburg as the northern , european capital city . we have accomplished a lot .
our city is one of the most dynamically developing regions .
we have been able to achieve significant growth in leading economic sectors .
we have attracted investors and created transparent and fair conditions for the corporate world .
since the administrative court has started holding meetings here , the city 's image has improved accordingly . st. petersburg has been called " russia 's detroit " because automobile manufacturing giants like gm , toyota and nissan want to build factories in the city .
why are n't there any germany car companies in st. petersburg ? we have n't had any negotiations with volkswagen because their board did n't get in touch with us .
but we did negotiate with daimler chrysler .
why are n't they here ?
the luxury car maker wanted exclusive production rights .
however , we follow the russian laws for foreign car manufacturers entering the market .
the russian government did n't want to make changes to the law , even in the case of such a highly regarded company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 leaders will stay at the konstantin palace in st. petersburg this week other producers successfully came away from the negotiations .
numerous agreements have been signed and projects are currently in the works .
in addition , we are negotiating with a series of distribution and component production companies .
we seem to be creating a real auto industry in st. petersburg . as far as german companies go in general , they 're very active in st. petersburg .
knauf , bosch and siemens are currently putting up shop here .
german companies know and love st. petersburg . st. petersburg has been labeled " the capital of russian nationalism " .
how serious is the situation with racism there today ? people did in fact want to brand st. petersburg as a racist city , which does n't match the public opinion and the spirits of our residents here at all .
st. petersburg began as an international city .
over 100 nationalities and ethnic groups and all kinds of different religions are represented here . in our 300-year history there have never been conflicts based on where people came from .
however , the accusations have intensified now just before the g8 summit and , unfortunately , some people in the media have adopted these speculations . nonetheless , xenophobia and nationalism are also present here , just as they are in every other country , especially in metropolitan areas . sergei morosov interviewed valentina matviyenko -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian turn at g8 helm seen as leadership test russia will take over the presidency of the g8 states for the first time in 2006 , despite the country 's questionable status in the club of the eight wealthiest nations .

" no , we were n't here for the football .
we came for this .
we are a bit bedazzled .
there is nothing this big back home , " said dale harwick , a horticulturist from melbourne , australia seeking shade under a tree . " mate , at eight o 'clock all the floats go up to the front and they all make music together .
the top comes off , " he explained . " the love is back " the love parade dates back to 1989 , the year the berlin wall fell . the first time it drew 150 people but in following years the numbers exploded as post-communist berlin became a cool destination for young travelers from all over and the techno music trend for marathon dance parties swept the world . in 1999 , 1.5 million paraders packed out central berlin for 24 hours of dancing and kindness among strangers but in recent years the shine wore off as revelers complained that it had become an increasingly commercial event . for the past two years , the parade was canceled for lack of funding .
it returned this year under the title " the love is back " after the owner of a chain of fitness clubs put up two million euros -lrb- 2.5 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship . " drugs have no place at the parade " this time the parade also aimed to change its image of revelers tripped out on ecstasy with hard alcohol beverages in hand . instead , participants were given glucose candy to keep up the energy levels and handed non-alcoholic beverages to lower the possibility of accidents . the main sponsor , rainer schaller said that " drugs have no place at the parade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical love parade scene die-hard fans said they had sorely missed the event and were happy to drive across europe to come back .
" it 's my fourth time .
it is beautiful to see so many people all do the same thing , " said martin haas , one of a group of dutch students all dressed up in roman togas for the party .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .
members and followers recruited the new organization from the amal movement - the traditional but economically bankrupt political party representing the shia community , lebanon 's largest religious bloc . the iranian dream it 's significant that hezbollah was founded during a meeting at the iranian embassy in beirut .
iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .
violent exchanges , on the other hand , keep the conflict simmering .
they claim new victims , fortify the fronts , and strengthen the resolve on both sides . syria and iran have used hezbollah to set a trap for israel - and without great foresight , israel has fallen into it .
those who demand violent solutions can not truly have an interest in peace . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : israel uses " disproportionate force " in lebanon the worsening situation in the middle east has captured the world 's attention , including the european union 's , which has accused israel of " disproportionate use of force " in lebanon .

dw-world.de interviewed valentina matviyenko , mayor of president putin 's multi-cultural hometown . dw-world.de : which problems will be discussed during the s ummit ?
what will russia 's contribution look like , concerning issues like global energy security and viral epidemics , for example ? valentina matviyenko : generally , topics brought up at g8 summits are relevant for the world population .
you mentioned some of them already .
of course , russia wo n't just stand around and play the host .
as the state that holds the g8 presidency this year , we are preparing our proposals for all of the issues on the table .
i ca n't tell you what the proposals are yet . as far as energy security is concerned , russia - as a major distributor of energy - has the right to act as a trendsetter in this area and offer suggestions that will later be practically implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentina matviyenko st. petersburg has always wrestled with moscow over being the capital city .
has the city at least become a cultural , financial or commercial - if not political - capital city since putin took office ? vladimir putin was born in st. petersburg .
no one else understands the role st. petersburg has played in the country , historically and today , like he does .
that 's why the city has had so many problems making its enormous economic , scientific and educational potential attractive for russia .
naturally , putin sees st. petersburg as the northern , european capital city . we have accomplished a lot .
our city is one of the most dynamically developing regions .
we have been able to achieve significant growth in leading economic sectors .
we have attracted investors and created transparent and fair conditions for the corporate world .
since the administrative court has started holding meetings here , the city 's image has improved accordingly . st. petersburg has been called " russia 's detroit " because automobile manufacturing giants like gm , toyota and nissan want to build factories in the city .
why are n't there any germany car companies in st. petersburg ? we have n't had any negotiations with volkswagen because their board did n't get in touch with us .
but we did negotiate with daimler chrysler .
why are n't they here ?
the luxury car maker wanted exclusive production rights .
however , we follow the russian laws for foreign car manufacturers entering the market .
the russian government did n't want to make changes to the law , even in the case of such a highly regarded company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 leaders will stay at the konstantin palace in st. petersburg this week other producers successfully came away from the negotiations .
numerous agreements have been signed and projects are currently in the works .
in addition , we are negotiating with a series of distribution and component production companies .
we seem to be creating a real auto industry in st. petersburg . as far as german companies go in general , they 're very active in st. petersburg .
knauf , bosch and siemens are currently putting up shop here .
german companies know and love st. petersburg . st. petersburg has been labeled " the capital of russian nationalism " .
how serious is the situation with racism there today ? people did in fact want to brand st. petersburg as a racist city , which does n't match the public opinion and the spirits of our residents here at all .
st. petersburg began as an international city .
over 100 nationalities and ethnic groups and all kinds of different religions are represented here . in our 300-year history there have never been conflicts based on where people came from .
however , the accusations have intensified now just before the g8 summit and , unfortunately , some people in the media have adopted these speculations . nonetheless , xenophobia and nationalism are also present here , just as they are in every other country , especially in metropolitan areas . sergei morosov interviewed valentina matviyenko -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian turn at g8 helm seen as leadership test russia will take over the presidency of the g8 states for the first time in 2006 , despite the country 's questionable status in the club of the eight wealthiest nations .

about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war . " the losses are massive .
it 's too early to give numbers but everything is pointing to very serious losses , " tourism minister joseph sarkis told reuters .
" it was shaping up to be a very good summer season ...
unfortunately , the season has been hit . " bildunterschrift : over 60 civilians have been killed since israel launched a bitter offensive on its northern neighbor on wednesday after hezbollah militia captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight .
israeli attacks have left lebanon virtually cut off from the outside world , targeting the southern suburbs of beirut , the country 's only international airport as well as bridges and roads across the south of the country . " keep a low profile " the us state department warned americans against traveling to lebanon , authorized embassy personnel and their families to evacuate and advised other us citizens there to " keep a low profile . " the state department estimates that about 25,000 us citizens , including people with dual citizenship , live in lebanon , although summer visits could expand that community . greece and spain too have said they were evacuating their nationals from lebanon .
the french government said it was preparing to evacuate its embassy in lebanon and recommended citizens to avoid all travel to the country .

up to 5,000 french tourists are believed to be in lebanon in addition to about 17,000 french residents who are registered with the consular service there . tensions in germany over events as israeli planes blasted roads and bridges in south , east and north lebanon on saturday , a day after hezbollah 's chief declared open war on israel for a blitz launched in reprisal for the capture of two israeli soldiers , international condemnation intensified . the european union still remains divided on the issue , with members such as france and finland slamming the israeli reaction as " completely disproportionate . " the israeli offensive in lebanon has also led to political tensions within germany .
members of the country 's central council of jews have accused german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of " apparently using double standards . " steinmeier had earlier said that he understood that every country had the right to defend itself if attacked .
at the same time he said that israel had to show a measured response to the kidnapping of israeli soldiers by the hezbollah . steinmeier later told zdf television that israel 's targeting of lebanese infrastructure was not a " necessary reaction . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany warned against one-sided condemnations of israel .

members of a german-lebanese family were reportedly killed in israeli strikes . foreigners were advised to evacuate lebanon and suspend all travel to the country as israeli forces pounded suspected hezbollah strongholds there for the fourth day , raising fears of full-scale war . france , germany , greece , the philippines , spain and the united states were among those which issued warnings to their citizens either living in the conflict zone or planning trips there amid the escalating violence . newspaper : german-lebanese family killed a german newspaper reported in its saturday edition that three members of a german-lebanese family were killed and one wounded in the israeli offensive on lebanon . the süddeutsche zeitung quoted raef khachab , a businessman from munich , as saying his 43-year-old cousin , his pregnant wife and their teenage daughter died in an israeli air raid in southern lebanon on thursday morning when rockets struck the home of relatives they were visiting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge as it is targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon khachab said the family 's 11-year-old son was injured in the attack on shour , a village near the main coastal city of tyre , and had been hospitalized .
he said his cousin was a naturalized german citizen who settled in the country 25 years ago .
the family lived in mönchengladbach in western germany . according to lebanese police , five civilians were killed in shour on thursday morning when israeli planes bombed villages and towns in southern lebanon . german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger on friday said the government was trying to verify the information . " there are indications that a german-lebanese family could be among the victims .
the embassy in beirut is in close contact with lebanese officials and we are trying to establish the facts . " governments issue travel warnings with no sign of a lull in the attacks , the german foreign ministry warned citizens not to travel to lebanon , the palestinian territories or any of israel 's border regions , saying " the situation is very insecure . " there are about 1,100 germans living in lebanon , according to the ministry .
about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war . " the losses are massive .
it 's too early to give numbers but everything is pointing to very serious losses , " tourism minister joseph sarkis told reuters .
" it was shaping up to be a very good summer season ...
unfortunately , the season has been hit . " bildunterschrift : over 60 civilians have been killed since israel launched a bitter offensive on its northern neighbor on wednesday after hezbollah militia captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight .
israeli attacks have left lebanon virtually cut off from the outside world , targeting the southern suburbs of beirut , the country 's only international airport as well as bridges and roads across the south of the country . " keep a low profile " the us state department warned americans against traveling to lebanon , authorized embassy personnel and their families to evacuate and advised other us citizens there to " keep a low profile . " the state department estimates that about 25,000 us citizens , including people with dual citizenship , live in lebanon , although summer visits could expand that community . greece and spain too have said they were evacuating their nationals from lebanon .
the french government said it was preparing to evacuate its embassy in lebanon and recommended citizens to avoid all travel to the country .
a special hotline has been set up for people with relatives in lebanon , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut is home to thousands of foreign expatriates lebanon is a former french colony and many french citizens have business and family ties with the country .
up to 5,000 french tourists are believed to be in lebanon in addition to about 17,000 french residents who are registered with the consular service there . tensions in germany over events as israeli planes blasted roads and bridges in south , east and north lebanon on saturday , a day after hezbollah 's chief declared open war on israel for a blitz launched in reprisal for the capture of two israeli soldiers , international condemnation intensified . the european union still remains divided on the issue , with members such as france and finland slamming the israeli reaction as " completely disproportionate . " the israeli offensive in lebanon has also led to political tensions within germany .
members of the country 's central council of jews have accused german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of " apparently using double standards . " steinmeier had earlier said that he understood that every country had the right to defend itself if attacked .
at the same time he said that israel had to show a measured response to the kidnapping of israeli soldiers by the hezbollah . steinmeier later told zdf television that israel 's targeting of lebanese infrastructure was not a " necessary reaction .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .
members and followers recruited the new organization from the amal movement - the traditional but economically bankrupt political party representing the shia community , lebanon 's largest religious bloc . the iranian dream it 's significant that hezbollah was founded during a meeting at the iranian embassy in beirut .
iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .
violent exchanges , on the other hand , keep the conflict simmering .
they claim new victims , fortify the fronts , and strengthen the resolve on both sides . syria and iran have used hezbollah to set a trap for israel - and without great foresight , israel has fallen into it .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .
members and followers recruited the new organization from the amal movement - the traditional but economically bankrupt political party representing the shia community , lebanon 's largest religious bloc . the iranian dream it 's significant that hezbollah was founded during a meeting at the iranian embassy in beirut .
iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .
violent exchanges , on the other hand , keep the conflict simmering .
they claim new victims , fortify the fronts , and strengthen the resolve on both sides . syria and iran have used hezbollah to set a trap for israel - and without great foresight , israel has fallen into it .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict . " " on the one hand , the capture of prisoners and shelling the territory of another state is absolutely unacceptable , " ivanov said , referring to the shiite hezbollah militia in lebanon . " on the other hand , the use of military force on such a scale and against such targets i think is also unacceptable , or at least disproportionate , " he added , referring this time to israel . " whether we like it or not the only way of resolving this very difficult situation is to return to the negotiating table , " ivanov said . " summit should n't be a talking shop " germany called for a halt to the spiraling violence with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier calling on " all concerned parties in the region to take an active part in de-escalation , " according to a ministry statement , after a telephone conversation with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . according to an edition of news magazine der spiegel due to appear monday , germany is actively involved in the search for peace at the request of several western states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel use her influence with israel at the request of bush ?
it claims that berlin , through chancellor angela merkel , had sought to use its influence with israel at the request of president george w. bush . " the implications are very serious and we need to assess it with urgency , " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman warned . " this -lrb- summit -rrb- should n't be a talking shop .
it should be setting an agenda which will help de-escalate the situation . " israel 's offensive was launched three weeks ago in gaza and this week in lebanon to secure the release of three soldiers seized by militant groups and to halt their rocket attacks on the jewish state . the military campaign has left more than 90 dead in lebanon alone as well as scores in gaza and brought widespread international condemnation . bush , putin clash over democracy , wto meanwhile bush also clashed with putin over democratic reforms , an issue he had promised to raise here . pressing issues like a free press and religion , he proposed war-torn iraq could be a model for moscow .
" i told him that a lot of people in our country would hope russia would do the same thing , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin clashed over democracy to which putin retorted , to laughter : " we certainly would not want to have the same kind of democracy as they have in iraq . " " just wait , " bush replied . separately , russian and us negotiators failed despite intensive talks here to overcome lingering obstacles to a bilateral accord enabling moscow to join the wto , which sets global trade rules . bush said washington supported moscow 's 13-year quest to join the wto and a deal was " almost reached " but " there 's more work to be done . " putin admitted the difficulties , saying national interests were at stake . " i ca n't say that we were not expecting such a complication , " he said .
" we will continue to work , defending our interests and the interests of our growing economy . " russia is currently the only major power operating outside wto trade rules , and agreement here would have confirmed its rising status as a commercial and economic powerhouse . russia and the united states adopted what a us official billed as a global initiative against nuclear terrorism , a control and monitoring mechanism aimed at keeping atomic materials out of the hands of extremists . russia cracks down on protestors meanwhile russian riot police broke up a planned march by communist activists saturday protesting against the summit of g8 world leaders in saint petersburg . around 100 communists gathered in the centre of the former tsarist capital despite a ban on any rallies during the summit , which ends monday.eventually they were allowed to hold a meeting in a site four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- away but were refused permission to unfurl any banners or chant slogans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against the g8 summit clash with riot police riot police intervened when some of the activists tried to demonstrate on the street , causing scuffles which led to the arrest of at least 10 people . among slogans which could be heard were " g8 outlaws " and " world without g8 , russia without putin , " referring to russian president vladimir putin . valentin romanov , a communist deputy in the russian parliament , criticized the ban on the rally as excessive . " you have to take security measures but you also have to respect people .
these security measures are excessive when the summit is taking place outside saint petersburg . " the tight security measures for the g8 club 's annual summit have also led to a clampdown on anti-globalization protesters who have been confined to a stadium far from the event . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de governments warn citizens to stay clear of lebanon amid spiraling mideast violence , several governments , including germany 's , have warned their nationals to stay away from lebanon .

we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict .

" no , we were n't here for the football .
we came for this .
we are a bit bedazzled .
there is nothing this big back home , " said dale harwick , a horticulturist from melbourne , australia seeking shade under a tree . " mate , at eight o 'clock all the floats go up to the front and they all make music together .
the top comes off , " he explained . " the love is back " the love parade dates back to 1989 , the year the berlin wall fell . the first time it drew 150 people but in following years the numbers exploded as post-communist berlin became a cool destination for young travelers from all over and the techno music trend for marathon dance parties swept the world . in 1999 , 1.5 million paraders packed out central berlin for 24 hours of dancing and kindness among strangers but in recent years the shine wore off as revelers complained that it had become an increasingly commercial event . for the past two years , the parade was canceled for lack of funding .
it returned this year under the title " the love is back " after the owner of a chain of fitness clubs put up two million euros -lrb- 2.5 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship . " drugs have no place at the parade " this time the parade also aimed to change its image of revelers tripped out on ecstasy with hard alcohol beverages in hand . instead , participants were given glucose candy to keep up the energy levels and handed non-alcoholic beverages to lower the possibility of accidents . the main sponsor , rainer schaller said that " drugs have no place at the parade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical love parade scene die-hard fans said they had sorely missed the event and were happy to drive across europe to come back .
" it 's my fourth time .
it is beautiful to see so many people all do the same thing , " said martin haas , one of a group of dutch students all dressed up in roman togas for the party .
they stood out for being so classical , surrounded by a sea of girls wearing leopard print underwear and pigtails or plastic flowers in their hair and tattoos everywhere .
a few german girls coolly ignored the thumping beat in identical t-shirts proclaiming " no pictures please . " " it is pure provocation .
everybody talks to us and takes lots of pictures , " laughed anite breuer , a bank clerk from the western city of cologne . love parade veteran henrik schrage , a bar owner from osnabrück also in western germany , said it was the eighth year he had come to the party but remarked that it was off to a worryingly slow start .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict . " " on the one hand , the capture of prisoners and shelling the territory of another state is absolutely unacceptable , " ivanov said , referring to the shiite hezbollah militia in lebanon . " on the other hand , the use of military force on such a scale and against such targets i think is also unacceptable , or at least disproportionate , " he added , referring this time to israel . " whether we like it or not the only way of resolving this very difficult situation is to return to the negotiating table , " ivanov said . " summit should n't be a talking shop " germany called for a halt to the spiraling violence with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier calling on " all concerned parties in the region to take an active part in de-escalation , " according to a ministry statement , after a telephone conversation with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . according to an edition of news magazine der spiegel due to appear monday , germany is actively involved in the search for peace at the request of several western states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel use her influence with israel at the request of bush ?
it claims that berlin , through chancellor angela merkel , had sought to use its influence with israel at the request of president george w. bush . " the implications are very serious and we need to assess it with urgency , " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman warned . " this -lrb- summit -rrb- should n't be a talking shop .
it should be setting an agenda which will help de-escalate the situation . " israel 's offensive was launched three weeks ago in gaza and this week in lebanon to secure the release of three soldiers seized by militant groups and to halt their rocket attacks on the jewish state . the military campaign has left more than 90 dead in lebanon alone as well as scores in gaza and brought widespread international condemnation . bush , putin clash over democracy , wto meanwhile bush also clashed with putin over democratic reforms , an issue he had promised to raise here . pressing issues like a free press and religion , he proposed war-torn iraq could be a model for moscow .
" i told him that a lot of people in our country would hope russia would do the same thing , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin clashed over democracy to which putin retorted , to laughter : " we certainly would not want to have the same kind of democracy as they have in iraq . " " just wait , " bush replied . separately , russian and us negotiators failed despite intensive talks here to overcome lingering obstacles to a bilateral accord enabling moscow to join the wto , which sets global trade rules . bush said washington supported moscow 's 13-year quest to join the wto and a deal was " almost reached " but " there 's more work to be done . " putin admitted the difficulties , saying national interests were at stake . " i ca n't say that we were not expecting such a complication , " he said .
" we will continue to work , defending our interests and the interests of our growing economy . " russia is currently the only major power operating outside wto trade rules , and agreement here would have confirmed its rising status as a commercial and economic powerhouse . russia and the united states adopted what a us official billed as a global initiative against nuclear terrorism , a control and monitoring mechanism aimed at keeping atomic materials out of the hands of extremists . russia cracks down on protestors meanwhile russian riot police broke up a planned march by communist activists saturday protesting against the summit of g8 world leaders in saint petersburg . around 100 communists gathered in the centre of the former tsarist capital despite a ban on any rallies during the summit , which ends monday.eventually they were allowed to hold a meeting in a site four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- away but were refused permission to unfurl any banners or chant slogans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against the g8 summit clash with riot police riot police intervened when some of the activists tried to demonstrate on the street , causing scuffles which led to the arrest of at least 10 people . among slogans which could be heard were " g8 outlaws " and " world without g8 , russia without putin , " referring to russian president vladimir putin . valentin romanov , a communist deputy in the russian parliament , criticized the ban on the rally as excessive . " you have to take security measures but you also have to respect people .
these security measures are excessive when the summit is taking place outside saint petersburg .

members of a german-lebanese family were reportedly killed in israeli strikes . foreigners were advised to evacuate lebanon and suspend all travel to the country as israeli forces pounded suspected hezbollah strongholds there for the fourth day , raising fears of full-scale war . france , germany , greece , the philippines , spain and the united states were among those which issued warnings to their citizens either living in the conflict zone or planning trips there amid the escalating violence . newspaper : german-lebanese family killed a german newspaper reported in its saturday edition that three members of a german-lebanese family were killed and one wounded in the israeli offensive on lebanon . the süddeutsche zeitung quoted raef khachab , a businessman from munich , as saying his 43-year-old cousin , his pregnant wife and their teenage daughter died in an israeli air raid in southern lebanon on thursday morning when rockets struck the home of relatives they were visiting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge as it is targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon khachab said the family 's 11-year-old son was injured in the attack on shour , a village near the main coastal city of tyre , and had been hospitalized .
he said his cousin was a naturalized german citizen who settled in the country 25 years ago .
the family lived in mönchengladbach in western germany . according to lebanese police , five civilians were killed in shour on thursday morning when israeli planes bombed villages and towns in southern lebanon . german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger on friday said the government was trying to verify the information . " there are indications that a german-lebanese family could be among the victims .
the embassy in beirut is in close contact with lebanese officials and we are trying to establish the facts . " governments issue travel warnings with no sign of a lull in the attacks , the german foreign ministry warned citizens not to travel to lebanon , the palestinian territories or any of israel 's border regions , saying " the situation is very insecure . " there are about 1,100 germans living in lebanon , according to the ministry .
about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war . " the losses are massive .
it 's too early to give numbers but everything is pointing to very serious losses , " tourism minister joseph sarkis told reuters .
" it was shaping up to be a very good summer season ...
unfortunately , the season has been hit . " bildunterschrift : over 60 civilians have been killed since israel launched a bitter offensive on its northern neighbor on wednesday after hezbollah militia captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight .
israeli attacks have left lebanon virtually cut off from the outside world , targeting the southern suburbs of beirut , the country 's only international airport as well as bridges and roads across the south of the country . " keep a low profile " the us state department warned americans against traveling to lebanon , authorized embassy personnel and their families to evacuate and advised other us citizens there to " keep a low profile . " the state department estimates that about 25,000 us citizens , including people with dual citizenship , live in lebanon , although summer visits could expand that community . greece and spain too have said they were evacuating their nationals from lebanon .
the french government said it was preparing to evacuate its embassy in lebanon and recommended citizens to avoid all travel to the country .
a special hotline has been set up for people with relatives in lebanon , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut is home to thousands of foreign expatriates lebanon is a former french colony and many french citizens have business and family ties with the country .
up to 5,000 french tourists are believed to be in lebanon in addition to about 17,000 french residents who are registered with the consular service there . tensions in germany over events as israeli planes blasted roads and bridges in south , east and north lebanon on saturday , a day after hezbollah 's chief declared open war on israel for a blitz launched in reprisal for the capture of two israeli soldiers , international condemnation intensified . the european union still remains divided on the issue , with members such as france and finland slamming the israeli reaction as " completely disproportionate . " the israeli offensive in lebanon has also led to political tensions within germany .
members of the country 's central council of jews have accused german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of " apparently using double standards . " steinmeier had earlier said that he understood that every country had the right to defend itself if attacked .
at the same time he said that israel had to show a measured response to the kidnapping of israeli soldiers by the hezbollah . steinmeier later told zdf television that israel 's targeting of lebanese infrastructure was not a " necessary reaction . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany warned against one-sided condemnations of israel .

about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war . " the losses are massive .
it 's too early to give numbers but everything is pointing to very serious losses , " tourism minister joseph sarkis told reuters .
" it was shaping up to be a very good summer season ...
unfortunately , the season has been hit . " bildunterschrift : over 60 civilians have been killed since israel launched a bitter offensive on its northern neighbor on wednesday after hezbollah militia captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight .
israeli attacks have left lebanon virtually cut off from the outside world , targeting the southern suburbs of beirut , the country 's only international airport as well as bridges and roads across the south of the country . " keep a low profile " the us state department warned americans against traveling to lebanon , authorized embassy personnel and their families to evacuate and advised other us citizens there to " keep a low profile . " the state department estimates that about 25,000 us citizens , including people with dual citizenship , live in lebanon , although summer visits could expand that community . greece and spain too have said they were evacuating their nationals from lebanon .
the french government said it was preparing to evacuate its embassy in lebanon and recommended citizens to avoid all travel to the country .
a special hotline has been set up for people with relatives in lebanon , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut is home to thousands of foreign expatriates lebanon is a former french colony and many french citizens have business and family ties with the country .
up to 5,000 french tourists are believed to be in lebanon in addition to about 17,000 french residents who are registered with the consular service there . tensions in germany over events as israeli planes blasted roads and bridges in south , east and north lebanon on saturday , a day after hezbollah 's chief declared open war on israel for a blitz launched in reprisal for the capture of two israeli soldiers , international condemnation intensified . the european union still remains divided on the issue , with members such as france and finland slamming the israeli reaction as " completely disproportionate . " the israeli offensive in lebanon has also led to political tensions within germany .
members of the country 's central council of jews have accused german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of " apparently using double standards . " steinmeier had earlier said that he understood that every country had the right to defend itself if attacked .
at the same time he said that israel had to show a measured response to the kidnapping of israeli soldiers by the hezbollah . steinmeier later told zdf television that israel 's targeting of lebanese infrastructure was not a " necessary reaction . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany warned against one-sided condemnations of israel .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .
members and followers recruited the new organization from the amal movement - the traditional but economically bankrupt political party representing the shia community , lebanon 's largest religious bloc . the iranian dream it 's significant that hezbollah was founded during a meeting at the iranian embassy in beirut .
iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .
violent exchanges , on the other hand , keep the conflict simmering .
they claim new victims , fortify the fronts , and strengthen the resolve on both sides . syria and iran have used hezbollah to set a trap for israel - and without great foresight , israel has fallen into it .
those who demand violent solutions can not truly have an interest in peace . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : israel uses " disproportionate force " in lebanon the worsening situation in the middle east has captured the world 's attention , including the european union 's , which has accused israel of " disproportionate use of force " in lebanon .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict . " " on the one hand , the capture of prisoners and shelling the territory of another state is absolutely unacceptable , " ivanov said , referring to the shiite hezbollah militia in lebanon . " on the other hand , the use of military force on such a scale and against such targets i think is also unacceptable , or at least disproportionate , " he added , referring this time to israel . " whether we like it or not the only way of resolving this very difficult situation is to return to the negotiating table , " ivanov said . " summit should n't be a talking shop " germany called for a halt to the spiraling violence with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier calling on " all concerned parties in the region to take an active part in de-escalation , " according to a ministry statement , after a telephone conversation with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . according to an edition of news magazine der spiegel due to appear monday , germany is actively involved in the search for peace at the request of several western states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel use her influence with israel at the request of bush ?
it claims that berlin , through chancellor angela merkel , had sought to use its influence with israel at the request of president george w. bush . " the implications are very serious and we need to assess it with urgency , " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman warned . " this -lrb- summit -rrb- should n't be a talking shop .
it should be setting an agenda which will help de-escalate the situation . " israel 's offensive was launched three weeks ago in gaza and this week in lebanon to secure the release of three soldiers seized by militant groups and to halt their rocket attacks on the jewish state . the military campaign has left more than 90 dead in lebanon alone as well as scores in gaza and brought widespread international condemnation . bush , putin clash over democracy , wto meanwhile bush also clashed with putin over democratic reforms , an issue he had promised to raise here . pressing issues like a free press and religion , he proposed war-torn iraq could be a model for moscow .
" i told him that a lot of people in our country would hope russia would do the same thing , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin clashed over democracy to which putin retorted , to laughter : " we certainly would not want to have the same kind of democracy as they have in iraq . " " just wait , " bush replied . separately , russian and us negotiators failed despite intensive talks here to overcome lingering obstacles to a bilateral accord enabling moscow to join the wto , which sets global trade rules . bush said washington supported moscow 's 13-year quest to join the wto and a deal was " almost reached " but " there 's more work to be done . " putin admitted the difficulties , saying national interests were at stake . " i ca n't say that we were not expecting such a complication , " he said .
" we will continue to work , defending our interests and the interests of our growing economy . " russia is currently the only major power operating outside wto trade rules , and agreement here would have confirmed its rising status as a commercial and economic powerhouse . russia and the united states adopted what a us official billed as a global initiative against nuclear terrorism , a control and monitoring mechanism aimed at keeping atomic materials out of the hands of extremists . russia cracks down on protestors meanwhile russian riot police broke up a planned march by communist activists saturday protesting against the summit of g8 world leaders in saint petersburg . around 100 communists gathered in the centre of the former tsarist capital despite a ban on any rallies during the summit , which ends monday.eventually they were allowed to hold a meeting in a site four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- away but were refused permission to unfurl any banners or chant slogans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against the g8 summit clash with riot police riot police intervened when some of the activists tried to demonstrate on the street , causing scuffles which led to the arrest of at least 10 people . among slogans which could be heard were " g8 outlaws " and " world without g8 , russia without putin , " referring to russian president vladimir putin . valentin romanov , a communist deputy in the russian parliament , criticized the ban on the rally as excessive . " you have to take security measures but you also have to respect people .
these security measures are excessive when the summit is taking place outside saint petersburg . " the tight security measures for the g8 club 's annual summit have also led to a clampdown on anti-globalization protesters who have been confined to a stadium far from the event . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de governments warn citizens to stay clear of lebanon amid spiraling mideast violence , several governments , including germany 's , have warned their nationals to stay away from lebanon .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .
members and followers recruited the new organization from the amal movement - the traditional but economically bankrupt political party representing the shia community , lebanon 's largest religious bloc . the iranian dream it 's significant that hezbollah was founded during a meeting at the iranian embassy in beirut .
iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .
violent exchanges , on the other hand , keep the conflict simmering .
they claim new victims , fortify the fronts , and strengthen the resolve on both sides . syria and iran have used hezbollah to set a trap for israel - and without great foresight , israel has fallen into it .

" no , we were n't here for the football .
we came for this .
we are a bit bedazzled .
there is nothing this big back home , " said dale harwick , a horticulturist from melbourne , australia seeking shade under a tree . " mate , at eight o 'clock all the floats go up to the front and they all make music together .
the top comes off , " he explained . " the love is back " the love parade dates back to 1989 , the year the berlin wall fell . the first time it drew 150 people but in following years the numbers exploded as post-communist berlin became a cool destination for young travelers from all over and the techno music trend for marathon dance parties swept the world . in 1999 , 1.5 million paraders packed out central berlin for 24 hours of dancing and kindness among strangers but in recent years the shine wore off as revelers complained that it had become an increasingly commercial event . for the past two years , the parade was canceled for lack of funding .
it returned this year under the title " the love is back " after the owner of a chain of fitness clubs put up two million euros -lrb- 2.5 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship . " drugs have no place at the parade " this time the parade also aimed to change its image of revelers tripped out on ecstasy with hard alcohol beverages in hand . instead , participants were given glucose candy to keep up the energy levels and handed non-alcoholic beverages to lower the possibility of accidents . the main sponsor , rainer schaller said that " drugs have no place at the parade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical love parade scene die-hard fans said they had sorely missed the event and were happy to drive across europe to come back .
" it 's my fourth time .
it is beautiful to see so many people all do the same thing , " said martin haas , one of a group of dutch students all dressed up in roman togas for the party .
they stood out for being so classical , surrounded by a sea of girls wearing leopard print underwear and pigtails or plastic flowers in their hair and tattoos everywhere .
a few german girls coolly ignored the thumping beat in identical t-shirts proclaiming " no pictures please . " " it is pure provocation .
everybody talks to us and takes lots of pictures , " laughed anite breuer , a bank clerk from the western city of cologne . love parade veteran henrik schrage , a bar owner from osnabrück also in western germany , said it was the eighth year he had come to the party but remarked that it was off to a worryingly slow start .
by early evening however , organisers said they had hit the million mark as a human tide stretched all the way from the brandenburg gate to the 19th century victory column monument . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin fan mile beats oktoberfest in popularity contest with its world cup fan mile , berlin gave munich 's oktoberfest a run for its money in the stakes as the ultimate party draw - and won , say officials from the german tourism office .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .
members and followers recruited the new organization from the amal movement - the traditional but economically bankrupt political party representing the shia community , lebanon 's largest religious bloc . the iranian dream it 's significant that hezbollah was founded during a meeting at the iranian embassy in beirut .
iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .
violent exchanges , on the other hand , keep the conflict simmering .
they claim new victims , fortify the fronts , and strengthen the resolve on both sides . syria and iran have used hezbollah to set a trap for israel - and without great foresight , israel has fallen into it .

" no , we were n't here for the football .
we came for this .
we are a bit bedazzled .
there is nothing this big back home , " said dale harwick , a horticulturist from melbourne , australia seeking shade under a tree . " mate , at eight o 'clock all the floats go up to the front and they all make music together .
the top comes off , " he explained . " the love is back " the love parade dates back to 1989 , the year the berlin wall fell . the first time it drew 150 people but in following years the numbers exploded as post-communist berlin became a cool destination for young travelers from all over and the techno music trend for marathon dance parties swept the world . in 1999 , 1.5 million paraders packed out central berlin for 24 hours of dancing and kindness among strangers but in recent years the shine wore off as revelers complained that it had become an increasingly commercial event . for the past two years , the parade was canceled for lack of funding .
it returned this year under the title " the love is back " after the owner of a chain of fitness clubs put up two million euros -lrb- 2.5 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship . " drugs have no place at the parade " this time the parade also aimed to change its image of revelers tripped out on ecstasy with hard alcohol beverages in hand . instead , participants were given glucose candy to keep up the energy levels and handed non-alcoholic beverages to lower the possibility of accidents . the main sponsor , rainer schaller said that " drugs have no place at the parade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical love parade scene die-hard fans said they had sorely missed the event and were happy to drive across europe to come back .
" it 's my fourth time .
it is beautiful to see so many people all do the same thing , " said martin haas , one of a group of dutch students all dressed up in roman togas for the party .
they stood out for being so classical , surrounded by a sea of girls wearing leopard print underwear and pigtails or plastic flowers in their hair and tattoos everywhere .
a few german girls coolly ignored the thumping beat in identical t-shirts proclaiming " no pictures please . " " it is pure provocation .
everybody talks to us and takes lots of pictures , " laughed anite breuer , a bank clerk from the western city of cologne . love parade veteran henrik schrage , a bar owner from osnabrück also in western germany , said it was the eighth year he had come to the party but remarked that it was off to a worryingly slow start .
by early evening however , organisers said they had hit the million mark as a human tide stretched all the way from the brandenburg gate to the 19th century victory column monument . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin fan mile beats oktoberfest in popularity contest with its world cup fan mile , berlin gave munich 's oktoberfest a run for its money in the stakes as the ultimate party draw - and won , say officials from the german tourism office .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict .

it should be setting an agenda which will help de-escalate the situation . " israel 's offensive was launched three weeks ago in gaza and this week in lebanon to secure the release of three soldiers seized by militant groups and to halt their rocket attacks on the jewish state . the military campaign has left more than 90 dead in lebanon alone as well as scores in gaza and brought widespread international condemnation . bush , putin clash over democracy , wto meanwhile bush also clashed with putin over democratic reforms , an issue he had promised to raise here . pressing issues like a free press and religion , he proposed war-torn iraq could be a model for moscow .

" we will continue to work , defending our interests and the interests of our growing economy . " russia is currently the only major power operating outside wto trade rules , and agreement here would have confirmed its rising status as a commercial and economic powerhouse . russia and the united states adopted what a us official billed as a global initiative against nuclear terrorism , a control and monitoring mechanism aimed at keeping atomic materials out of the hands of extremists . russia cracks down on protestors meanwhile russian riot police broke up a planned march by communist activists saturday protesting against the summit of g8 world leaders in saint petersburg . around 100 communists gathered in the centre of the former tsarist capital despite a ban on any rallies during the summit , which ends monday.eventually they were allowed to hold a meeting in a site four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- away but were refused permission to unfurl any banners or chant slogans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against the g8 summit clash with riot police riot police intervened when some of the activists tried to demonstrate on the street , causing scuffles which led to the arrest of at least 10 people . among slogans which could be heard were " g8 outlaws " and " world without g8 , russia without putin , " referring to russian president vladimir putin . valentin romanov , a communist deputy in the russian parliament , criticized the ban on the rally as excessive . " you have to take security measures but you also have to respect people .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .
members and followers recruited the new organization from the amal movement - the traditional but economically bankrupt political party representing the shia community , lebanon 's largest religious bloc . the iranian dream it 's significant that hezbollah was founded during a meeting at the iranian embassy in beirut .
iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .
violent exchanges , on the other hand , keep the conflict simmering .
they claim new victims , fortify the fronts , and strengthen the resolve on both sides . syria and iran have used hezbollah to set a trap for israel - and without great foresight , israel has fallen into it .
those who demand violent solutions can not truly have an interest in peace . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : israel uses " disproportionate force " in lebanon the worsening situation in the middle east has captured the world 's attention , including the european union 's , which has accused israel of " disproportionate use of force " in lebanon .

members of a german-lebanese family were reportedly killed in israeli strikes . foreigners were advised to evacuate lebanon and suspend all travel to the country as israeli forces pounded suspected hezbollah strongholds there for the fourth day , raising fears of full-scale war . france , germany , greece , the philippines , spain and the united states were among those which issued warnings to their citizens either living in the conflict zone or planning trips there amid the escalating violence . newspaper : german-lebanese family killed a german newspaper reported in its saturday edition that three members of a german-lebanese family were killed and one wounded in the israeli offensive on lebanon . the süddeutsche zeitung quoted raef khachab , a businessman from munich , as saying his 43-year-old cousin , his pregnant wife and their teenage daughter died in an israeli air raid in southern lebanon on thursday morning when rockets struck the home of relatives they were visiting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge as it is targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon khachab said the family 's 11-year-old son was injured in the attack on shour , a village near the main coastal city of tyre , and had been hospitalized .
he said his cousin was a naturalized german citizen who settled in the country 25 years ago .
the family lived in mönchengladbach in western germany . according to lebanese police , five civilians were killed in shour on thursday morning when israeli planes bombed villages and towns in southern lebanon . german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger on friday said the government was trying to verify the information . " there are indications that a german-lebanese family could be among the victims .
the embassy in beirut is in close contact with lebanese officials and we are trying to establish the facts . " governments issue travel warnings with no sign of a lull in the attacks , the german foreign ministry warned citizens not to travel to lebanon , the palestinian territories or any of israel 's border regions , saying " the situation is very insecure . " there are about 1,100 germans living in lebanon , according to the ministry .
about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war . " the losses are massive .
it 's too early to give numbers but everything is pointing to very serious losses , " tourism minister joseph sarkis told reuters .
" it was shaping up to be a very good summer season ...
unfortunately , the season has been hit . " bildunterschrift : over 60 civilians have been killed since israel launched a bitter offensive on its northern neighbor on wednesday after hezbollah militia captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight .
israeli attacks have left lebanon virtually cut off from the outside world , targeting the southern suburbs of beirut , the country 's only international airport as well as bridges and roads across the south of the country . " keep a low profile " the us state department warned americans against traveling to lebanon , authorized embassy personnel and their families to evacuate and advised other us citizens there to " keep a low profile . " the state department estimates that about 25,000 us citizens , including people with dual citizenship , live in lebanon , although summer visits could expand that community . greece and spain too have said they were evacuating their nationals from lebanon .
the french government said it was preparing to evacuate its embassy in lebanon and recommended citizens to avoid all travel to the country .
a special hotline has been set up for people with relatives in lebanon , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut is home to thousands of foreign expatriates lebanon is a former french colony and many french citizens have business and family ties with the country .
up to 5,000 french tourists are believed to be in lebanon in addition to about 17,000 french residents who are registered with the consular service there . tensions in germany over events as israeli planes blasted roads and bridges in south , east and north lebanon on saturday , a day after hezbollah 's chief declared open war on israel for a blitz launched in reprisal for the capture of two israeli soldiers , international condemnation intensified . the european union still remains divided on the issue , with members such as france and finland slamming the israeli reaction as " completely disproportionate . " the israeli offensive in lebanon has also led to political tensions within germany .
members of the country 's central council of jews have accused german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of " apparently using double standards . " steinmeier had earlier said that he understood that every country had the right to defend itself if attacked .
at the same time he said that israel had to show a measured response to the kidnapping of israeli soldiers by the hezbollah . steinmeier later told zdf television that israel 's targeting of lebanese infrastructure was not a " necessary reaction .

dw-world.de interviewed valentina matviyenko , mayor of president putin 's multi-cultural hometown . dw-world.de : which problems will be discussed during the s ummit ?
what will russia 's contribution look like , concerning issues like global energy security and viral epidemics , for example ? valentina matviyenko : generally , topics brought up at g8 summits are relevant for the world population .
you mentioned some of them already .
of course , russia wo n't just stand around and play the host .
as the state that holds the g8 presidency this year , we are preparing our proposals for all of the issues on the table .
i ca n't tell you what the proposals are yet . as far as energy security is concerned , russia - as a major distributor of energy - has the right to act as a trendsetter in this area and offer suggestions that will later be practically implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentina matviyenko st. petersburg has always wrestled with moscow over being the capital city .
has the city at least become a cultural , financial or commercial - if not political - capital city since putin took office ? vladimir putin was born in st. petersburg .
no one else understands the role st. petersburg has played in the country , historically and today , like he does .
that 's why the city has had so many problems making its enormous economic , scientific and educational potential attractive for russia .
naturally , putin sees st. petersburg as the northern , european capital city . we have accomplished a lot .
our city is one of the most dynamically developing regions .
we have been able to achieve significant growth in leading economic sectors .
we have attracted investors and created transparent and fair conditions for the corporate world .
since the administrative court has started holding meetings here , the city 's image has improved accordingly . st. petersburg has been called " russia 's detroit " because automobile manufacturing giants like gm , toyota and nissan want to build factories in the city .
why are n't there any germany car companies in st. petersburg ? we have n't had any negotiations with volkswagen because their board did n't get in touch with us .
but we did negotiate with daimler chrysler .
why are n't they here ?
the luxury car maker wanted exclusive production rights .
however , we follow the russian laws for foreign car manufacturers entering the market .
the russian government did n't want to make changes to the law , even in the case of such a highly regarded company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 leaders will stay at the konstantin palace in st. petersburg this week other producers successfully came away from the negotiations .
numerous agreements have been signed and projects are currently in the works .
in addition , we are negotiating with a series of distribution and component production companies .
we seem to be creating a real auto industry in st. petersburg . as far as german companies go in general , they 're very active in st. petersburg .
knauf , bosch and siemens are currently putting up shop here .
german companies know and love st. petersburg . st. petersburg has been labeled " the capital of russian nationalism " .
how serious is the situation with racism there today ? people did in fact want to brand st. petersburg as a racist city , which does n't match the public opinion and the spirits of our residents here at all .
st. petersburg began as an international city .
over 100 nationalities and ethnic groups and all kinds of different religions are represented here . in our 300-year history there have never been conflicts based on where people came from .
however , the accusations have intensified now just before the g8 summit and , unfortunately , some people in the media have adopted these speculations . nonetheless , xenophobia and nationalism are also present here , just as they are in every other country , especially in metropolitan areas . sergei morosov interviewed valentina matviyenko -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian turn at g8 helm seen as leadership test russia will take over the presidency of the g8 states for the first time in 2006 , despite the country 's questionable status in the club of the eight wealthiest nations .

" no , we were n't here for the football .
we came for this .
we are a bit bedazzled .
there is nothing this big back home , " said dale harwick , a horticulturist from melbourne , australia seeking shade under a tree . " mate , at eight o 'clock all the floats go up to the front and they all make music together .
the top comes off , " he explained . " the love is back " the love parade dates back to 1989 , the year the berlin wall fell . the first time it drew 150 people but in following years the numbers exploded as post-communist berlin became a cool destination for young travelers from all over and the techno music trend for marathon dance parties swept the world . in 1999 , 1.5 million paraders packed out central berlin for 24 hours of dancing and kindness among strangers but in recent years the shine wore off as revelers complained that it had become an increasingly commercial event . for the past two years , the parade was canceled for lack of funding .
it returned this year under the title " the love is back " after the owner of a chain of fitness clubs put up two million euros -lrb- 2.5 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship . " drugs have no place at the parade " this time the parade also aimed to change its image of revelers tripped out on ecstasy with hard alcohol beverages in hand . instead , participants were given glucose candy to keep up the energy levels and handed non-alcoholic beverages to lower the possibility of accidents . the main sponsor , rainer schaller said that " drugs have no place at the parade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical love parade scene die-hard fans said they had sorely missed the event and were happy to drive across europe to come back .
" it 's my fourth time .
it is beautiful to see so many people all do the same thing , " said martin haas , one of a group of dutch students all dressed up in roman togas for the party .

members of a german-lebanese family were reportedly killed in israeli strikes . foreigners were advised to evacuate lebanon and suspend all travel to the country as israeli forces pounded suspected hezbollah strongholds there for the fourth day , raising fears of full-scale war . france , germany , greece , the philippines , spain and the united states were among those which issued warnings to their citizens either living in the conflict zone or planning trips there amid the escalating violence . newspaper : german-lebanese family killed a german newspaper reported in its saturday edition that three members of a german-lebanese family were killed and one wounded in the israeli offensive on lebanon . the süddeutsche zeitung quoted raef khachab , a businessman from munich , as saying his 43-year-old cousin , his pregnant wife and their teenage daughter died in an israeli air raid in southern lebanon on thursday morning when rockets struck the home of relatives they were visiting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge as it is targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon khachab said the family 's 11-year-old son was injured in the attack on shour , a village near the main coastal city of tyre , and had been hospitalized .
he said his cousin was a naturalized german citizen who settled in the country 25 years ago .
the family lived in mönchengladbach in western germany . according to lebanese police , five civilians were killed in shour on thursday morning when israeli planes bombed villages and towns in southern lebanon . german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger on friday said the government was trying to verify the information . " there are indications that a german-lebanese family could be among the victims .
the embassy in beirut is in close contact with lebanese officials and we are trying to establish the facts . " governments issue travel warnings with no sign of a lull in the attacks , the german foreign ministry warned citizens not to travel to lebanon , the palestinian territories or any of israel 's border regions , saying " the situation is very insecure . " there are about 1,100 germans living in lebanon , according to the ministry .
about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war . " the losses are massive .
it 's too early to give numbers but everything is pointing to very serious losses , " tourism minister joseph sarkis told reuters .
" it was shaping up to be a very good summer season ...
unfortunately , the season has been hit . " bildunterschrift : over 60 civilians have been killed since israel launched a bitter offensive on its northern neighbor on wednesday after hezbollah militia captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight .
israeli attacks have left lebanon virtually cut off from the outside world , targeting the southern suburbs of beirut , the country 's only international airport as well as bridges and roads across the south of the country . " keep a low profile " the us state department warned americans against traveling to lebanon , authorized embassy personnel and their families to evacuate and advised other us citizens there to " keep a low profile . " the state department estimates that about 25,000 us citizens , including people with dual citizenship , live in lebanon , although summer visits could expand that community . greece and spain too have said they were evacuating their nationals from lebanon .
the french government said it was preparing to evacuate its embassy in lebanon and recommended citizens to avoid all travel to the country .
a special hotline has been set up for people with relatives in lebanon , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut is home to thousands of foreign expatriates lebanon is a former french colony and many french citizens have business and family ties with the country .
up to 5,000 french tourists are believed to be in lebanon in addition to about 17,000 french residents who are registered with the consular service there . tensions in germany over events as israeli planes blasted roads and bridges in south , east and north lebanon on saturday , a day after hezbollah 's chief declared open war on israel for a blitz launched in reprisal for the capture of two israeli soldiers , international condemnation intensified . the european union still remains divided on the issue , with members such as france and finland slamming the israeli reaction as " completely disproportionate . " the israeli offensive in lebanon has also led to political tensions within germany .
members of the country 's central council of jews have accused german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of " apparently using double standards . " steinmeier had earlier said that he understood that every country had the right to defend itself if attacked .
at the same time he said that israel had to show a measured response to the kidnapping of israeli soldiers by the hezbollah . steinmeier later told zdf television that israel 's targeting of lebanese infrastructure was not a " necessary reaction . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany warned against one-sided condemnations of israel .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .
members and followers recruited the new organization from the amal movement - the traditional but economically bankrupt political party representing the shia community , lebanon 's largest religious bloc . the iranian dream it 's significant that hezbollah was founded during a meeting at the iranian embassy in beirut .
iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .
violent exchanges , on the other hand , keep the conflict simmering .
they claim new victims , fortify the fronts , and strengthen the resolve on both sides . syria and iran have used hezbollah to set a trap for israel - and without great foresight , israel has fallen into it .
those who demand violent solutions can not truly have an interest in peace . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : israel uses " disproportionate force " in lebanon the worsening situation in the middle east has captured the world 's attention , including the european union 's , which has accused israel of " disproportionate use of force " in lebanon .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .
members and followers recruited the new organization from the amal movement - the traditional but economically bankrupt political party representing the shia community , lebanon 's largest religious bloc . the iranian dream it 's significant that hezbollah was founded during a meeting at the iranian embassy in beirut .
iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .
violent exchanges , on the other hand , keep the conflict simmering .
they claim new victims , fortify the fronts , and strengthen the resolve on both sides . syria and iran have used hezbollah to set a trap for israel - and without great foresight , israel has fallen into it .
those who demand violent solutions can not truly have an interest in peace . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : israel uses " disproportionate force " in lebanon the worsening situation in the middle east has captured the world 's attention , including the european union 's , which has accused israel of " disproportionate use of force " in lebanon .

" no , we were n't here for the football .
we came for this .
we are a bit bedazzled .
there is nothing this big back home , " said dale harwick , a horticulturist from melbourne , australia seeking shade under a tree . " mate , at eight o 'clock all the floats go up to the front and they all make music together .
the top comes off , " he explained . " the love is back " the love parade dates back to 1989 , the year the berlin wall fell . the first time it drew 150 people but in following years the numbers exploded as post-communist berlin became a cool destination for young travelers from all over and the techno music trend for marathon dance parties swept the world . in 1999 , 1.5 million paraders packed out central berlin for 24 hours of dancing and kindness among strangers but in recent years the shine wore off as revelers complained that it had become an increasingly commercial event . for the past two years , the parade was canceled for lack of funding .
it returned this year under the title " the love is back " after the owner of a chain of fitness clubs put up two million euros -lrb- 2.5 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship . " drugs have no place at the parade " this time the parade also aimed to change its image of revelers tripped out on ecstasy with hard alcohol beverages in hand . instead , participants were given glucose candy to keep up the energy levels and handed non-alcoholic beverages to lower the possibility of accidents . the main sponsor , rainer schaller said that " drugs have no place at the parade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical love parade scene die-hard fans said they had sorely missed the event and were happy to drive across europe to come back .
" it 's my fourth time .
it is beautiful to see so many people all do the same thing , " said martin haas , one of a group of dutch students all dressed up in roman togas for the party .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict . " " on the one hand , the capture of prisoners and shelling the territory of another state is absolutely unacceptable , " ivanov said , referring to the shiite hezbollah militia in lebanon . " on the other hand , the use of military force on such a scale and against such targets i think is also unacceptable , or at least disproportionate , " he added , referring this time to israel . " whether we like it or not the only way of resolving this very difficult situation is to return to the negotiating table , " ivanov said . " summit should n't be a talking shop " germany called for a halt to the spiraling violence with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier calling on " all concerned parties in the region to take an active part in de-escalation , " according to a ministry statement , after a telephone conversation with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . according to an edition of news magazine der spiegel due to appear monday , germany is actively involved in the search for peace at the request of several western states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel use her influence with israel at the request of bush ?

" the implications are very serious and we need to assess it with urgency , " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman warned . " this -lrb- summit -rrb- should n't be a talking shop .
it should be setting an agenda which will help de-escalate the situation . " israel 's offensive was launched three weeks ago in gaza and this week in lebanon to secure the release of three soldiers seized by militant groups and to halt their rocket attacks on the jewish state . the military campaign has left more than 90 dead in lebanon alone as well as scores in gaza and brought widespread international condemnation . bush , putin clash over democracy , wto meanwhile bush also clashed with putin over democratic reforms , an issue he had promised to raise here . pressing issues like a free press and religion , he proposed war-torn iraq could be a model for moscow .
" i told him that a lot of people in our country would hope russia would do the same thing , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin clashed over democracy to which putin retorted , to laughter : " we certainly would not want to have the same kind of democracy as they have in iraq . " " just wait , " bush replied . separately , russian and us negotiators failed despite intensive talks here to overcome lingering obstacles to a bilateral accord enabling moscow to join the wto , which sets global trade rules . bush said washington supported moscow 's 13-year quest to join the wto and a deal was " almost reached " but " there 's more work to be done . " putin admitted the difficulties , saying national interests were at stake . " i ca n't say that we were not expecting such a complication , " he said .
" we will continue to work , defending our interests and the interests of our growing economy . " russia is currently the only major power operating outside wto trade rules , and agreement here would have confirmed its rising status as a commercial and economic powerhouse . russia and the united states adopted what a us official billed as a global initiative against nuclear terrorism , a control and monitoring mechanism aimed at keeping atomic materials out of the hands of extremists . russia cracks down on protestors meanwhile russian riot police broke up a planned march by communist activists saturday protesting against the summit of g8 world leaders in saint petersburg . around 100 communists gathered in the centre of the former tsarist capital despite a ban on any rallies during the summit , which ends monday.eventually they were allowed to hold a meeting in a site four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- away but were refused permission to unfurl any banners or chant slogans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against the g8 summit clash with riot police riot police intervened when some of the activists tried to demonstrate on the street , causing scuffles which led to the arrest of at least 10 people . among slogans which could be heard were " g8 outlaws " and " world without g8 , russia without putin , " referring to russian president vladimir putin . valentin romanov , a communist deputy in the russian parliament , criticized the ban on the rally as excessive . " you have to take security measures but you also have to respect people .
these security measures are excessive when the summit is taking place outside saint petersburg .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict .

" we will continue to work , defending our interests and the interests of our growing economy .

members of a german-lebanese family were reportedly killed in israeli strikes . foreigners were advised to evacuate lebanon and suspend all travel to the country as israeli forces pounded suspected hezbollah strongholds there for the fourth day , raising fears of full-scale war . france , germany , greece , the philippines , spain and the united states were among those which issued warnings to their citizens either living in the conflict zone or planning trips there amid the escalating violence . newspaper : german-lebanese family killed a german newspaper reported in its saturday edition that three members of a german-lebanese family were killed and one wounded in the israeli offensive on lebanon . the süddeutsche zeitung quoted raef khachab , a businessman from munich , as saying his 43-year-old cousin , his pregnant wife and their teenage daughter died in an israeli air raid in southern lebanon on thursday morning when rockets struck the home of relatives they were visiting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge as it is targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon khachab said the family 's 11-year-old son was injured in the attack on shour , a village near the main coastal city of tyre , and had been hospitalized .
he said his cousin was a naturalized german citizen who settled in the country 25 years ago .
the family lived in mönchengladbach in western germany . according to lebanese police , five civilians were killed in shour on thursday morning when israeli planes bombed villages and towns in southern lebanon . german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger on friday said the government was trying to verify the information . " there are indications that a german-lebanese family could be among the victims .
the embassy in beirut is in close contact with lebanese officials and we are trying to establish the facts . " governments issue travel warnings with no sign of a lull in the attacks , the german foreign ministry warned citizens not to travel to lebanon , the palestinian territories or any of israel 's border regions , saying " the situation is very insecure . " there are about 1,100 germans living in lebanon , according to the ministry .
about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war . " the losses are massive .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .
members and followers recruited the new organization from the amal movement - the traditional but economically bankrupt political party representing the shia community , lebanon 's largest religious bloc . the iranian dream it 's significant that hezbollah was founded during a meeting at the iranian embassy in beirut .
iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .
violent exchanges , on the other hand , keep the conflict simmering .
they claim new victims , fortify the fronts , and strengthen the resolve on both sides . syria and iran have used hezbollah to set a trap for israel - and without great foresight , israel has fallen into it .
those who demand violent solutions can not truly have an interest in peace . peter philipp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : israel uses " disproportionate force " in lebanon the worsening situation in the middle east has captured the world 's attention , including the european union 's , which has accused israel of " disproportionate use of force " in lebanon .

" no , we were n't here for the football .
we came for this .
we are a bit bedazzled .
there is nothing this big back home , " said dale harwick , a horticulturist from melbourne , australia seeking shade under a tree . " mate , at eight o 'clock all the floats go up to the front and they all make music together .
the top comes off , " he explained . " the love is back " the love parade dates back to 1989 , the year the berlin wall fell . the first time it drew 150 people but in following years the numbers exploded as post-communist berlin became a cool destination for young travelers from all over and the techno music trend for marathon dance parties swept the world . in 1999 , 1.5 million paraders packed out central berlin for 24 hours of dancing and kindness among strangers but in recent years the shine wore off as revelers complained that it had become an increasingly commercial event . for the past two years , the parade was canceled for lack of funding .
it returned this year under the title " the love is back " after the owner of a chain of fitness clubs put up two million euros -lrb- 2.5 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship . " drugs have no place at the parade " this time the parade also aimed to change its image of revelers tripped out on ecstasy with hard alcohol beverages in hand . instead , participants were given glucose candy to keep up the energy levels and handed non-alcoholic beverages to lower the possibility of accidents . the main sponsor , rainer schaller said that " drugs have no place at the parade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical love parade scene die-hard fans said they had sorely missed the event and were happy to drive across europe to come back .
" it 's my fourth time .
it is beautiful to see so many people all do the same thing , " said martin haas , one of a group of dutch students all dressed up in roman togas for the party .
they stood out for being so classical , surrounded by a sea of girls wearing leopard print underwear and pigtails or plastic flowers in their hair and tattoos everywhere .
a few german girls coolly ignored the thumping beat in identical t-shirts proclaiming " no pictures please . " " it is pure provocation .
everybody talks to us and takes lots of pictures , " laughed anite breuer , a bank clerk from the western city of cologne . love parade veteran henrik schrage , a bar owner from osnabrück also in western germany , said it was the eighth year he had come to the party but remarked that it was off to a worryingly slow start .
by early evening however , organisers said they had hit the million mark as a human tide stretched all the way from the brandenburg gate to the 19th century victory column monument . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin fan mile beats oktoberfest in popularity contest with its world cup fan mile , berlin gave munich 's oktoberfest a run for its money in the stakes as the ultimate party draw - and won , say officials from the german tourism office .

dw-world.de interviewed valentina matviyenko , mayor of president putin 's multi-cultural hometown . dw-world.de : which problems will be discussed during the s ummit ?
what will russia 's contribution look like , concerning issues like global energy security and viral epidemics , for example ? valentina matviyenko : generally , topics brought up at g8 summits are relevant for the world population .
you mentioned some of them already .
of course , russia wo n't just stand around and play the host .
as the state that holds the g8 presidency this year , we are preparing our proposals for all of the issues on the table .
i ca n't tell you what the proposals are yet . as far as energy security is concerned , russia - as a major distributor of energy - has the right to act as a trendsetter in this area and offer suggestions that will later be practically implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentina matviyenko st. petersburg has always wrestled with moscow over being the capital city .
has the city at least become a cultural , financial or commercial - if not political - capital city since putin took office ? vladimir putin was born in st. petersburg .
no one else understands the role st. petersburg has played in the country , historically and today , like he does .
that 's why the city has had so many problems making its enormous economic , scientific and educational potential attractive for russia .
naturally , putin sees st. petersburg as the northern , european capital city . we have accomplished a lot .
our city is one of the most dynamically developing regions .
we have been able to achieve significant growth in leading economic sectors .
we have attracted investors and created transparent and fair conditions for the corporate world .
since the administrative court has started holding meetings here , the city 's image has improved accordingly . st. petersburg has been called " russia 's detroit " because automobile manufacturing giants like gm , toyota and nissan want to build factories in the city .
why are n't there any germany car companies in st. petersburg ? we have n't had any negotiations with volkswagen because their board did n't get in touch with us .
but we did negotiate with daimler chrysler .
why are n't they here ?
the luxury car maker wanted exclusive production rights .
however , we follow the russian laws for foreign car manufacturers entering the market .
the russian government did n't want to make changes to the law , even in the case of such a highly regarded company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 leaders will stay at the konstantin palace in st. petersburg this week other producers successfully came away from the negotiations .
numerous agreements have been signed and projects are currently in the works .
in addition , we are negotiating with a series of distribution and component production companies .
we seem to be creating a real auto industry in st. petersburg . as far as german companies go in general , they 're very active in st. petersburg .
knauf , bosch and siemens are currently putting up shop here .
german companies know and love st. petersburg . st. petersburg has been labeled " the capital of russian nationalism " .
how serious is the situation with racism there today ? people did in fact want to brand st. petersburg as a racist city , which does n't match the public opinion and the spirits of our residents here at all .
st. petersburg began as an international city .
over 100 nationalities and ethnic groups and all kinds of different religions are represented here . in our 300-year history there have never been conflicts based on where people came from .
however , the accusations have intensified now just before the g8 summit and , unfortunately , some people in the media have adopted these speculations . nonetheless , xenophobia and nationalism are also present here , just as they are in every other country , especially in metropolitan areas . sergei morosov interviewed valentina matviyenko -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian turn at g8 helm seen as leadership test russia will take over the presidency of the g8 states for the first time in 2006 , despite the country 's questionable status in the club of the eight wealthiest nations .

members of a german-lebanese family were reportedly killed in israeli strikes . foreigners were advised to evacuate lebanon and suspend all travel to the country as israeli forces pounded suspected hezbollah strongholds there for the fourth day , raising fears of full-scale war . france , germany , greece , the philippines , spain and the united states were among those which issued warnings to their citizens either living in the conflict zone or planning trips there amid the escalating violence . newspaper : german-lebanese family killed a german newspaper reported in its saturday edition that three members of a german-lebanese family were killed and one wounded in the israeli offensive on lebanon . the süddeutsche zeitung quoted raef khachab , a businessman from munich , as saying his 43-year-old cousin , his pregnant wife and their teenage daughter died in an israeli air raid in southern lebanon on thursday morning when rockets struck the home of relatives they were visiting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge as it is targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon khachab said the family 's 11-year-old son was injured in the attack on shour , a village near the main coastal city of tyre , and had been hospitalized .
he said his cousin was a naturalized german citizen who settled in the country 25 years ago .
the family lived in mönchengladbach in western germany . according to lebanese police , five civilians were killed in shour on thursday morning when israeli planes bombed villages and towns in southern lebanon . german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger on friday said the government was trying to verify the information . " there are indications that a german-lebanese family could be among the victims .
the embassy in beirut is in close contact with lebanese officials and we are trying to establish the facts . " governments issue travel warnings with no sign of a lull in the attacks , the german foreign ministry warned citizens not to travel to lebanon , the palestinian territories or any of israel 's border regions , saying " the situation is very insecure . " there are about 1,100 germans living in lebanon , according to the ministry .
about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war . " the losses are massive .
it 's too early to give numbers but everything is pointing to very serious losses , " tourism minister joseph sarkis told reuters .
" it was shaping up to be a very good summer season ...
unfortunately , the season has been hit . " bildunterschrift : over 60 civilians have been killed since israel launched a bitter offensive on its northern neighbor on wednesday after hezbollah militia captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight .
israeli attacks have left lebanon virtually cut off from the outside world , targeting the southern suburbs of beirut , the country 's only international airport as well as bridges and roads across the south of the country . " keep a low profile " the us state department warned americans against traveling to lebanon , authorized embassy personnel and their families to evacuate and advised other us citizens there to " keep a low profile . " the state department estimates that about 25,000 us citizens , including people with dual citizenship , live in lebanon , although summer visits could expand that community . greece and spain too have said they were evacuating their nationals from lebanon .
the french government said it was preparing to evacuate its embassy in lebanon and recommended citizens to avoid all travel to the country .
a special hotline has been set up for people with relatives in lebanon , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut is home to thousands of foreign expatriates lebanon is a former french colony and many french citizens have business and family ties with the country .
up to 5,000 french tourists are believed to be in lebanon in addition to about 17,000 french residents who are registered with the consular service there . tensions in germany over events as israeli planes blasted roads and bridges in south , east and north lebanon on saturday , a day after hezbollah 's chief declared open war on israel for a blitz launched in reprisal for the capture of two israeli soldiers , international condemnation intensified . the european union still remains divided on the issue , with members such as france and finland slamming the israeli reaction as " completely disproportionate . " the israeli offensive in lebanon has also led to political tensions within germany .
members of the country 's central council of jews have accused german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of " apparently using double standards . " steinmeier had earlier said that he understood that every country had the right to defend itself if attacked .
at the same time he said that israel had to show a measured response to the kidnapping of israeli soldiers by the hezbollah . steinmeier later told zdf television that israel 's targeting of lebanese infrastructure was not a " necessary reaction . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany warned against one-sided condemnations of israel . " it would help some politicians if they tried to imagine how it would be if germany was under daily rocket attack , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " israel was massively provoked " german historian michael stürmer talked to dw-world.de about israel 's motivations behind the attacks on hezbollah strongholds in lebanon , the background of the conflict , and what the recent crisis could mean for germany .

the top comes off , " he explained . " the love is back " the love parade dates back to 1989 , the year the berlin wall fell . the first time it drew 150 people but in following years the numbers exploded as post-communist berlin became a cool destination for young travelers from all over and the techno music trend for marathon dance parties swept the world . in 1999 , 1.5 million paraders packed out central berlin for 24 hours of dancing and kindness among strangers but in recent years the shine wore off as revelers complained that it had become an increasingly commercial event . for the past two years , the parade was canceled for lack of funding .
it returned this year under the title " the love is back " after the owner of a chain of fitness clubs put up two million euros -lrb- 2.5 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship . " drugs have no place at the parade " this time the parade also aimed to change its image of revelers tripped out on ecstasy with hard alcohol beverages in hand . instead , participants were given glucose candy to keep up the energy levels and handed non-alcoholic beverages to lower the possibility of accidents . the main sponsor , rainer schaller said that " drugs have no place at the parade .

they stood out for being so classical , surrounded by a sea of girls wearing leopard print underwear and pigtails or plastic flowers in their hair and tattoos everywhere .
a few german girls coolly ignored the thumping beat in identical t-shirts proclaiming " no pictures please . " " it is pure provocation .
everybody talks to us and takes lots of pictures , " laughed anite breuer , a bank clerk from the western city of cologne . love parade veteran henrik schrage , a bar owner from osnabrück also in western germany , said it was the eighth year he had come to the party but remarked that it was off to a worryingly slow start .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict . " " on the one hand , the capture of prisoners and shelling the territory of another state is absolutely unacceptable , " ivanov said , referring to the shiite hezbollah militia in lebanon . " on the other hand , the use of military force on such a scale and against such targets i think is also unacceptable , or at least disproportionate , " he added , referring this time to israel . " whether we like it or not the only way of resolving this very difficult situation is to return to the negotiating table , " ivanov said . " summit should n't be a talking shop " germany called for a halt to the spiraling violence with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier calling on " all concerned parties in the region to take an active part in de-escalation , " according to a ministry statement , after a telephone conversation with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . according to an edition of news magazine der spiegel due to appear monday , germany is actively involved in the search for peace at the request of several western states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel use her influence with israel at the request of bush ?
it claims that berlin , through chancellor angela merkel , had sought to use its influence with israel at the request of president george w. bush . " the implications are very serious and we need to assess it with urgency , " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman warned . " this -lrb- summit -rrb- should n't be a talking shop .
it should be setting an agenda which will help de-escalate the situation . " israel 's offensive was launched three weeks ago in gaza and this week in lebanon to secure the release of three soldiers seized by militant groups and to halt their rocket attacks on the jewish state . the military campaign has left more than 90 dead in lebanon alone as well as scores in gaza and brought widespread international condemnation . bush , putin clash over democracy , wto meanwhile bush also clashed with putin over democratic reforms , an issue he had promised to raise here . pressing issues like a free press and religion , he proposed war-torn iraq could be a model for moscow .
" i told him that a lot of people in our country would hope russia would do the same thing , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin clashed over democracy to which putin retorted , to laughter : " we certainly would not want to have the same kind of democracy as they have in iraq . " " just wait , " bush replied . separately , russian and us negotiators failed despite intensive talks here to overcome lingering obstacles to a bilateral accord enabling moscow to join the wto , which sets global trade rules . bush said washington supported moscow 's 13-year quest to join the wto and a deal was " almost reached " but " there 's more work to be done .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .
members and followers recruited the new organization from the amal movement - the traditional but economically bankrupt political party representing the shia community , lebanon 's largest religious bloc . the iranian dream it 's significant that hezbollah was founded during a meeting at the iranian embassy in beirut .
iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .
violent exchanges , on the other hand , keep the conflict simmering .
they claim new victims , fortify the fronts , and strengthen the resolve on both sides . syria and iran have used hezbollah to set a trap for israel - and without great foresight , israel has fallen into it .

members of a german-lebanese family were reportedly killed in israeli strikes . foreigners were advised to evacuate lebanon and suspend all travel to the country as israeli forces pounded suspected hezbollah strongholds there for the fourth day , raising fears of full-scale war . france , germany , greece , the philippines , spain and the united states were among those which issued warnings to their citizens either living in the conflict zone or planning trips there amid the escalating violence . newspaper : german-lebanese family killed a german newspaper reported in its saturday edition that three members of a german-lebanese family were killed and one wounded in the israeli offensive on lebanon . the süddeutsche zeitung quoted raef khachab , a businessman from munich , as saying his 43-year-old cousin , his pregnant wife and their teenage daughter died in an israeli air raid in southern lebanon on thursday morning when rockets struck the home of relatives they were visiting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge as it is targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon khachab said the family 's 11-year-old son was injured in the attack on shour , a village near the main coastal city of tyre , and had been hospitalized .
he said his cousin was a naturalized german citizen who settled in the country 25 years ago .
the family lived in mönchengladbach in western germany . according to lebanese police , five civilians were killed in shour on thursday morning when israeli planes bombed villages and towns in southern lebanon . german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger on friday said the government was trying to verify the information . " there are indications that a german-lebanese family could be among the victims .
the embassy in beirut is in close contact with lebanese officials and we are trying to establish the facts . " governments issue travel warnings with no sign of a lull in the attacks , the german foreign ministry warned citizens not to travel to lebanon , the palestinian territories or any of israel 's border regions , saying " the situation is very insecure . " there are about 1,100 germans living in lebanon , according to the ministry .
about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war . " the losses are massive .
it 's too early to give numbers but everything is pointing to very serious losses , " tourism minister joseph sarkis told reuters .
" it was shaping up to be a very good summer season ...
unfortunately , the season has been hit . " bildunterschrift : over 60 civilians have been killed since israel launched a bitter offensive on its northern neighbor on wednesday after hezbollah militia captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight .
israeli attacks have left lebanon virtually cut off from the outside world , targeting the southern suburbs of beirut , the country 's only international airport as well as bridges and roads across the south of the country . " keep a low profile " the us state department warned americans against traveling to lebanon , authorized embassy personnel and their families to evacuate and advised other us citizens there to " keep a low profile . " the state department estimates that about 25,000 us citizens , including people with dual citizenship , live in lebanon , although summer visits could expand that community . greece and spain too have said they were evacuating their nationals from lebanon .
the french government said it was preparing to evacuate its embassy in lebanon and recommended citizens to avoid all travel to the country .
a special hotline has been set up for people with relatives in lebanon , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut is home to thousands of foreign expatriates lebanon is a former french colony and many french citizens have business and family ties with the country .
up to 5,000 french tourists are believed to be in lebanon in addition to about 17,000 french residents who are registered with the consular service there . tensions in germany over events as israeli planes blasted roads and bridges in south , east and north lebanon on saturday , a day after hezbollah 's chief declared open war on israel for a blitz launched in reprisal for the capture of two israeli soldiers , international condemnation intensified . the european union still remains divided on the issue , with members such as france and finland slamming the israeli reaction as " completely disproportionate . " the israeli offensive in lebanon has also led to political tensions within germany .
members of the country 's central council of jews have accused german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of " apparently using double standards . " steinmeier had earlier said that he understood that every country had the right to defend itself if attacked .
at the same time he said that israel had to show a measured response to the kidnapping of israeli soldiers by the hezbollah . steinmeier later told zdf television that israel 's targeting of lebanese infrastructure was not a " necessary reaction . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany warned against one-sided condemnations of israel . " it would help some politicians if they tried to imagine how it would be if germany was under daily rocket attack , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " israel was massively provoked " german historian michael stürmer talked to dw-world.de about israel 's motivations behind the attacks on hezbollah strongholds in lebanon , the background of the conflict , and what the recent crisis could mean for germany .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict . " " on the one hand , the capture of prisoners and shelling the territory of another state is absolutely unacceptable , " ivanov said , referring to the shiite hezbollah militia in lebanon . " on the other hand , the use of military force on such a scale and against such targets i think is also unacceptable , or at least disproportionate , " he added , referring this time to israel . " whether we like it or not the only way of resolving this very difficult situation is to return to the negotiating table , " ivanov said . " summit should n't be a talking shop " germany called for a halt to the spiraling violence with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier calling on " all concerned parties in the region to take an active part in de-escalation , " according to a ministry statement , after a telephone conversation with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . according to an edition of news magazine der spiegel due to appear monday , germany is actively involved in the search for peace at the request of several western states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel use her influence with israel at the request of bush ?
it claims that berlin , through chancellor angela merkel , had sought to use its influence with israel at the request of president george w. bush . " the implications are very serious and we need to assess it with urgency , " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman warned . " this -lrb- summit -rrb- should n't be a talking shop .
it should be setting an agenda which will help de-escalate the situation . " israel 's offensive was launched three weeks ago in gaza and this week in lebanon to secure the release of three soldiers seized by militant groups and to halt their rocket attacks on the jewish state . the military campaign has left more than 90 dead in lebanon alone as well as scores in gaza and brought widespread international condemnation . bush , putin clash over democracy , wto meanwhile bush also clashed with putin over democratic reforms , an issue he had promised to raise here . pressing issues like a free press and religion , he proposed war-torn iraq could be a model for moscow .
" i told him that a lot of people in our country would hope russia would do the same thing , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin clashed over democracy to which putin retorted , to laughter : " we certainly would not want to have the same kind of democracy as they have in iraq . " " just wait , " bush replied . separately , russian and us negotiators failed despite intensive talks here to overcome lingering obstacles to a bilateral accord enabling moscow to join the wto , which sets global trade rules . bush said washington supported moscow 's 13-year quest to join the wto and a deal was " almost reached " but " there 's more work to be done . " putin admitted the difficulties , saying national interests were at stake . " i ca n't say that we were not expecting such a complication , " he said .
" we will continue to work , defending our interests and the interests of our growing economy . " russia is currently the only major power operating outside wto trade rules , and agreement here would have confirmed its rising status as a commercial and economic powerhouse . russia and the united states adopted what a us official billed as a global initiative against nuclear terrorism , a control and monitoring mechanism aimed at keeping atomic materials out of the hands of extremists . russia cracks down on protestors meanwhile russian riot police broke up a planned march by communist activists saturday protesting against the summit of g8 world leaders in saint petersburg . around 100 communists gathered in the centre of the former tsarist capital despite a ban on any rallies during the summit , which ends monday.eventually they were allowed to hold a meeting in a site four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- away but were refused permission to unfurl any banners or chant slogans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against the g8 summit clash with riot police riot police intervened when some of the activists tried to demonstrate on the street , causing scuffles which led to the arrest of at least 10 people . among slogans which could be heard were " g8 outlaws " and " world without g8 , russia without putin , " referring to russian president vladimir putin . valentin romanov , a communist deputy in the russian parliament , criticized the ban on the rally as excessive .

we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict . " " on the one hand , the capture of prisoners and shelling the territory of another state is absolutely unacceptable , " ivanov said , referring to the shiite hezbollah militia in lebanon . " on the other hand , the use of military force on such a scale and against such targets i think is also unacceptable , or at least disproportionate , " he added , referring this time to israel . " whether we like it or not the only way of resolving this very difficult situation is to return to the negotiating table , " ivanov said . " summit should n't be a talking shop " germany called for a halt to the spiraling violence with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier calling on " all concerned parties in the region to take an active part in de-escalation , " according to a ministry statement , after a telephone conversation with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . according to an edition of news magazine der spiegel due to appear monday , germany is actively involved in the search for peace at the request of several western states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel use her influence with israel at the request of bush ?
it claims that berlin , through chancellor angela merkel , had sought to use its influence with israel at the request of president george w. bush . " the implications are very serious and we need to assess it with urgency , " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman warned . " this -lrb- summit -rrb- should n't be a talking shop .
it should be setting an agenda which will help de-escalate the situation . " israel 's offensive was launched three weeks ago in gaza and this week in lebanon to secure the release of three soldiers seized by militant groups and to halt their rocket attacks on the jewish state . the military campaign has left more than 90 dead in lebanon alone as well as scores in gaza and brought widespread international condemnation . bush , putin clash over democracy , wto meanwhile bush also clashed with putin over democratic reforms , an issue he had promised to raise here . pressing issues like a free press and religion , he proposed war-torn iraq could be a model for moscow .
" i told him that a lot of people in our country would hope russia would do the same thing , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin clashed over democracy to which putin retorted , to laughter : " we certainly would not want to have the same kind of democracy as they have in iraq . " " just wait , " bush replied . separately , russian and us negotiators failed despite intensive talks here to overcome lingering obstacles to a bilateral accord enabling moscow to join the wto , which sets global trade rules . bush said washington supported moscow 's 13-year quest to join the wto and a deal was " almost reached " but " there 's more work to be done . " putin admitted the difficulties , saying national interests were at stake . " i ca n't say that we were not expecting such a complication , " he said .
" we will continue to work , defending our interests and the interests of our growing economy . " russia is currently the only major power operating outside wto trade rules , and agreement here would have confirmed its rising status as a commercial and economic powerhouse . russia and the united states adopted what a us official billed as a global initiative against nuclear terrorism , a control and monitoring mechanism aimed at keeping atomic materials out of the hands of extremists . russia cracks down on protestors meanwhile russian riot police broke up a planned march by communist activists saturday protesting against the summit of g8 world leaders in saint petersburg . around 100 communists gathered in the centre of the former tsarist capital despite a ban on any rallies during the summit , which ends monday.eventually they were allowed to hold a meeting in a site four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- away but were refused permission to unfurl any banners or chant slogans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against the g8 summit clash with riot police riot police intervened when some of the activists tried to demonstrate on the street , causing scuffles which led to the arrest of at least 10 people . among slogans which could be heard were " g8 outlaws " and " world without g8 , russia without putin , " referring to russian president vladimir putin . valentin romanov , a communist deputy in the russian parliament , criticized the ban on the rally as excessive . " you have to take security measures but you also have to respect people .
these security measures are excessive when the summit is taking place outside saint petersburg . " the tight security measures for the g8 club 's annual summit have also led to a clampdown on anti-globalization protesters who have been confined to a stadium far from the event . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de governments warn citizens to stay clear of lebanon amid spiraling mideast violence , several governments , including germany 's , have warned their nationals to stay away from lebanon .

there is nothing this big back home , " said dale harwick , a horticulturist from melbourne , australia seeking shade under a tree . " mate , at eight o 'clock all the floats go up to the front and they all make music together .
the top comes off , " he explained . " the love is back " the love parade dates back to 1989 , the year the berlin wall fell . the first time it drew 150 people but in following years the numbers exploded as post-communist berlin became a cool destination for young travelers from all over and the techno music trend for marathon dance parties swept the world . in 1999 , 1.5 million paraders packed out central berlin for 24 hours of dancing and kindness among strangers but in recent years the shine wore off as revelers complained that it had become an increasingly commercial event . for the past two years , the parade was canceled for lack of funding .
it returned this year under the title " the love is back " after the owner of a chain of fitness clubs put up two million euros -lrb- 2.5 million dollars -rrb- in sponsorship . " drugs have no place at the parade " this time the parade also aimed to change its image of revelers tripped out on ecstasy with hard alcohol beverages in hand . instead , participants were given glucose candy to keep up the energy levels and handed non-alcoholic beverages to lower the possibility of accidents . the main sponsor , rainer schaller said that " drugs have no place at the parade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical love parade scene die-hard fans said they had sorely missed the event and were happy to drive across europe to come back .
" it 's my fourth time .
it is beautiful to see so many people all do the same thing , " said martin haas , one of a group of dutch students all dressed up in roman togas for the party .
they stood out for being so classical , surrounded by a sea of girls wearing leopard print underwear and pigtails or plastic flowers in their hair and tattoos everywhere .
a few german girls coolly ignored the thumping beat in identical t-shirts proclaiming " no pictures please . " " it is pure provocation .
everybody talks to us and takes lots of pictures , " laughed anite breuer , a bank clerk from the western city of cologne . love parade veteran henrik schrage , a bar owner from osnabrück also in western germany , said it was the eighth year he had come to the party but remarked that it was off to a worryingly slow start .
by early evening however , organisers said they had hit the million mark as a human tide stretched all the way from the brandenburg gate to the 19th century victory column monument . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin fan mile beats oktoberfest in popularity contest with its world cup fan mile , berlin gave munich 's oktoberfest a run for its money in the stakes as the ultimate party draw - and won , say officials from the german tourism office .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict . " " on the one hand , the capture of prisoners and shelling the territory of another state is absolutely unacceptable , " ivanov said , referring to the shiite hezbollah militia in lebanon . " on the other hand , the use of military force on such a scale and against such targets i think is also unacceptable , or at least disproportionate , " he added , referring this time to israel . " whether we like it or not the only way of resolving this very difficult situation is to return to the negotiating table , " ivanov said . " summit should n't be a talking shop " germany called for a halt to the spiraling violence with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier calling on " all concerned parties in the region to take an active part in de-escalation , " according to a ministry statement , after a telephone conversation with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . according to an edition of news magazine der spiegel due to appear monday , germany is actively involved in the search for peace at the request of several western states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel use her influence with israel at the request of bush ?
it claims that berlin , through chancellor angela merkel , had sought to use its influence with israel at the request of president george w. bush . " the implications are very serious and we need to assess it with urgency , " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman warned . " this -lrb- summit -rrb- should n't be a talking shop .
it should be setting an agenda which will help de-escalate the situation . " israel 's offensive was launched three weeks ago in gaza and this week in lebanon to secure the release of three soldiers seized by militant groups and to halt their rocket attacks on the jewish state . the military campaign has left more than 90 dead in lebanon alone as well as scores in gaza and brought widespread international condemnation . bush , putin clash over democracy , wto meanwhile bush also clashed with putin over democratic reforms , an issue he had promised to raise here . pressing issues like a free press and religion , he proposed war-torn iraq could be a model for moscow .
" i told him that a lot of people in our country would hope russia would do the same thing , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin clashed over democracy to which putin retorted , to laughter : " we certainly would not want to have the same kind of democracy as they have in iraq . " " just wait , " bush replied . separately , russian and us negotiators failed despite intensive talks here to overcome lingering obstacles to a bilateral accord enabling moscow to join the wto , which sets global trade rules . bush said washington supported moscow 's 13-year quest to join the wto and a deal was " almost reached " but " there 's more work to be done . " putin admitted the difficulties , saying national interests were at stake . " i ca n't say that we were not expecting such a complication , " he said .
" we will continue to work , defending our interests and the interests of our growing economy . " russia is currently the only major power operating outside wto trade rules , and agreement here would have confirmed its rising status as a commercial and economic powerhouse . russia and the united states adopted what a us official billed as a global initiative against nuclear terrorism , a control and monitoring mechanism aimed at keeping atomic materials out of the hands of extremists . russia cracks down on protestors meanwhile russian riot police broke up a planned march by communist activists saturday protesting against the summit of g8 world leaders in saint petersburg . around 100 communists gathered in the centre of the former tsarist capital despite a ban on any rallies during the summit , which ends monday.eventually they were allowed to hold a meeting in a site four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- away but were refused permission to unfurl any banners or chant slogans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against the g8 summit clash with riot police riot police intervened when some of the activists tried to demonstrate on the street , causing scuffles which led to the arrest of at least 10 people . among slogans which could be heard were " g8 outlaws " and " world without g8 , russia without putin , " referring to russian president vladimir putin . valentin romanov , a communist deputy in the russian parliament , criticized the ban on the rally as excessive . " you have to take security measures but you also have to respect people .
these security measures are excessive when the summit is taking place outside saint petersburg .

iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .
violent exchanges , on the other hand , keep the conflict simmering .
they claim new victims , fortify the fronts , and strengthen the resolve on both sides . syria and iran have used hezbollah to set a trap for israel - and without great foresight , israel has fallen into it .

" we are concerned about violence .
we are troubled by the loss of innocent life , " bush said , demanding hezbollah " lay down its arms " and end attacks on israel and urging syria to pressure it into doing so . russia says diplomacy the only solution putin insisted that " recourse to violence must be balanced and it must be stopped as soon as possible , " saying the g8 leaders would do all they could . neither leader resorted to the stronger language used by their governments earlier in the week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli tanks fire across the border into southern lebanon it was left to russian defense minister sergei ivanov to voice fears of a regional war , warning of a " real threat of involvement of other states in this conflict . " " on the one hand , the capture of prisoners and shelling the territory of another state is absolutely unacceptable , " ivanov said , referring to the shiite hezbollah militia in lebanon . " on the other hand , the use of military force on such a scale and against such targets i think is also unacceptable , or at least disproportionate , " he added , referring this time to israel . " whether we like it or not the only way of resolving this very difficult situation is to return to the negotiating table , " ivanov said . " summit should n't be a talking shop " germany called for a halt to the spiraling violence with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier calling on " all concerned parties in the region to take an active part in de-escalation , " according to a ministry statement , after a telephone conversation with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora . according to an edition of news magazine der spiegel due to appear monday , germany is actively involved in the search for peace at the request of several western states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel use her influence with israel at the request of bush ?
it claims that berlin , through chancellor angela merkel , had sought to use its influence with israel at the request of president george w. bush . " the implications are very serious and we need to assess it with urgency , " british prime minister tony blair 's spokesman warned . " this -lrb- summit -rrb- should n't be a talking shop .
it should be setting an agenda which will help de-escalate the situation . " israel 's offensive was launched three weeks ago in gaza and this week in lebanon to secure the release of three soldiers seized by militant groups and to halt their rocket attacks on the jewish state . the military campaign has left more than 90 dead in lebanon alone as well as scores in gaza and brought widespread international condemnation . bush , putin clash over democracy , wto meanwhile bush also clashed with putin over democratic reforms , an issue he had promised to raise here . pressing issues like a free press and religion , he proposed war-torn iraq could be a model for moscow .
" i told him that a lot of people in our country would hope russia would do the same thing , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin clashed over democracy to which putin retorted , to laughter : " we certainly would not want to have the same kind of democracy as they have in iraq . " " just wait , " bush replied . separately , russian and us negotiators failed despite intensive talks here to overcome lingering obstacles to a bilateral accord enabling moscow to join the wto , which sets global trade rules . bush said washington supported moscow 's 13-year quest to join the wto and a deal was " almost reached " but " there 's more work to be done . " putin admitted the difficulties , saying national interests were at stake . " i ca n't say that we were not expecting such a complication , " he said .
" we will continue to work , defending our interests and the interests of our growing economy . " russia is currently the only major power operating outside wto trade rules , and agreement here would have confirmed its rising status as a commercial and economic powerhouse . russia and the united states adopted what a us official billed as a global initiative against nuclear terrorism , a control and monitoring mechanism aimed at keeping atomic materials out of the hands of extremists . russia cracks down on protestors meanwhile russian riot police broke up a planned march by communist activists saturday protesting against the summit of g8 world leaders in saint petersburg . around 100 communists gathered in the centre of the former tsarist capital despite a ban on any rallies during the summit , which ends monday.eventually they were allowed to hold a meeting in a site four kilometers -lrb- 2.5 miles -rrb- away but were refused permission to unfurl any banners or chant slogans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against the g8 summit clash with riot police riot police intervened when some of the activists tried to demonstrate on the street , causing scuffles which led to the arrest of at least 10 people . among slogans which could be heard were " g8 outlaws " and " world without g8 , russia without putin , " referring to russian president vladimir putin . valentin romanov , a communist deputy in the russian parliament , criticized the ban on the rally as excessive . " you have to take security measures but you also have to respect people .
these security measures are excessive when the summit is taking place outside saint petersburg . " the tight security measures for the g8 club 's annual summit have also led to a clampdown on anti-globalization protesters who have been confined to a stadium far from the event . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de governments warn citizens to stay clear of lebanon amid spiraling mideast violence , several governments , including germany 's , have warned their nationals to stay away from lebanon .

members of a german-lebanese family were reportedly killed in israeli strikes . foreigners were advised to evacuate lebanon and suspend all travel to the country as israeli forces pounded suspected hezbollah strongholds there for the fourth day , raising fears of full-scale war . france , germany , greece , the philippines , spain and the united states were among those which issued warnings to their citizens either living in the conflict zone or planning trips there amid the escalating violence . newspaper : german-lebanese family killed a german newspaper reported in its saturday edition that three members of a german-lebanese family were killed and one wounded in the israeli offensive on lebanon . the süddeutsche zeitung quoted raef khachab , a businessman from munich , as saying his 43-year-old cousin , his pregnant wife and their teenage daughter died in an israeli air raid in southern lebanon on thursday morning when rockets struck the home of relatives they were visiting . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke rises from a bridge as it is targeted by an israeli air raid in the zahrani region , southern lebanon khachab said the family 's 11-year-old son was injured in the attack on shour , a village near the main coastal city of tyre , and had been hospitalized .
he said his cousin was a naturalized german citizen who settled in the country 25 years ago .
the family lived in mönchengladbach in western germany . according to lebanese police , five civilians were killed in shour on thursday morning when israeli planes bombed villages and towns in southern lebanon . german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger on friday said the government was trying to verify the information . " there are indications that a german-lebanese family could be among the victims .
the embassy in beirut is in close contact with lebanese officials and we are trying to establish the facts . " governments issue travel warnings with no sign of a lull in the attacks , the german foreign ministry warned citizens not to travel to lebanon , the palestinian territories or any of israel 's border regions , saying " the situation is very insecure . " there are about 1,100 germans living in lebanon , according to the ministry .
about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war . " the losses are massive .
it 's too early to give numbers but everything is pointing to very serious losses , " tourism minister joseph sarkis told reuters .
" it was shaping up to be a very good summer season ...
unfortunately , the season has been hit . " bildunterschrift : over 60 civilians have been killed since israel launched a bitter offensive on its northern neighbor on wednesday after hezbollah militia captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight .
israeli attacks have left lebanon virtually cut off from the outside world , targeting the southern suburbs of beirut , the country 's only international airport as well as bridges and roads across the south of the country . " keep a low profile " the us state department warned americans against traveling to lebanon , authorized embassy personnel and their families to evacuate and advised other us citizens there to " keep a low profile . " the state department estimates that about 25,000 us citizens , including people with dual citizenship , live in lebanon , although summer visits could expand that community . greece and spain too have said they were evacuating their nationals from lebanon .
the french government said it was preparing to evacuate its embassy in lebanon and recommended citizens to avoid all travel to the country .
a special hotline has been set up for people with relatives in lebanon , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut is home to thousands of foreign expatriates lebanon is a former french colony and many french citizens have business and family ties with the country .
up to 5,000 french tourists are believed to be in lebanon in addition to about 17,000 french residents who are registered with the consular service there . tensions in germany over events as israeli planes blasted roads and bridges in south , east and north lebanon on saturday , a day after hezbollah 's chief declared open war on israel for a blitz launched in reprisal for the capture of two israeli soldiers , international condemnation intensified . the european union still remains divided on the issue , with members such as france and finland slamming the israeli reaction as " completely disproportionate . " the israeli offensive in lebanon has also led to political tensions within germany .
members of the country 's central council of jews have accused german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier of " apparently using double standards . " steinmeier had earlier said that he understood that every country had the right to defend itself if attacked .
at the same time he said that israel had to show a measured response to the kidnapping of israeli soldiers by the hezbollah . steinmeier later told zdf television that israel 's targeting of lebanese infrastructure was not a " necessary reaction . " charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany warned against one-sided condemnations of israel . " it would help some politicians if they tried to imagine how it would be if germany was under daily rocket attack , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " israel was massively provoked " german historian michael stürmer talked to dw-world.de about israel 's motivations behind the attacks on hezbollah strongholds in lebanon , the background of the conflict , and what the recent crisis could mean for germany .

he said his cousin was a naturalized german citizen who settled in the country 25 years ago .
the family lived in mönchengladbach in western germany . according to lebanese police , five civilians were killed in shour on thursday morning when israeli planes bombed villages and towns in southern lebanon . german foreign ministry spokesman martin jäger on friday said the government was trying to verify the information .

the embassy in beirut is in close contact with lebanese officials and we are trying to establish the facts . " governments issue travel warnings with no sign of a lull in the attacks , the german foreign ministry warned citizens not to travel to lebanon , the palestinian territories or any of israel 's border regions , saying " the situation is very insecure .

about half of them hold dual nationality . the foreign ministry said it considered the area between the lebanese coastal city of sidon and the syrian border to be the most dangerous . it advised germans living in lebanon to stay at home , but said those who lived close to airports , power plants , main roads or southern beirut , considered a hezbollah stronghold , should move somewhere safer . german travel agencies have also cancelled planned trips to both lebanon and israel .
the israeli strikes have delivered a major blow to lebanon 's tourism industry . many other foreign tourists - mostly jordanians , syrians and iranians - also fled to syria through the borders . arabs are the main source of tourism in lebanon , which had been looking forward to a record season of about 1.6 million tourists to help bring in cash flow to a country still suffering from the devastation of the 1975-1990 civil war .

unfortunately , the season has been hit . " bildunterschrift : over 60 civilians have been killed since israel launched a bitter offensive on its northern neighbor on wednesday after hezbollah militia captured two israeli soldiers and killed eight .
israeli attacks have left lebanon virtually cut off from the outside world , targeting the southern suburbs of beirut , the country 's only international airport as well as bridges and roads across the south of the country . " keep a low profile " the us state department warned americans against traveling to lebanon , authorized embassy personnel and their families to evacuate and advised other us citizens there to " keep a low profile . " the state department estimates that about 25,000 us citizens , including people with dual citizenship , live in lebanon , although summer visits could expand that community . greece and spain too have said they were evacuating their nationals from lebanon .

an analysis by deutsche welle 's mideast expert peter philipp . hezbollah was founded in 1982 by iran and syria in order to fight the israeli occupation of southern lebanon .
members and followers recruited the new organization from the amal movement - the traditional but economically bankrupt political party representing the shia community , lebanon 's largest religious bloc . the iranian dream it 's significant that hezbollah was founded during a meeting at the iranian embassy in beirut .
iran has always tried to gain influence in lebanon , and had even dreamed of being able to proclaim a second islamic republic there with the help of the lebanese shiites .
that did n't happen , but 1982 did nonetheless offer an opportunity , with help of the shiite militia , to hit back at the hated enemy , israel .
iran and syria - bound since the days of the iran-iraq war - began to systematically build up hezbollah . the " party of god " received weapons , training and money from iran , and syria participated .
for both countries , hezbollah became a welcome instrument to do things they were n't ordinarily prepared to do for reasons of diplomacy or domestic security .
attacks by syrian troops on the israeli military , or the appearance of iranian troops in lebanon would have been perceived as acts of war - and not just by israel - and would have drawn tough military consequences .
but if hezbollah were to carry out such attacks , then it would fall into the category of a legitimate and uncontrollable act of resistance by an armed militia . goal : israel 's destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also in the background : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad in that respect , nothing changed when hezbollah began to portray itself as a political party .
today , it 's represented in the lebanese parliament and in the governing coalition .
even israel 's retreat from lebanon six years ago did nothing to change the situation : hezbollah sees itself - thanks mainly to tehran - as an ally of islamist groups under the palestinians .
it has already trained hamas militants , with whom it shares a single goal : the liberation of jerusalem , or in other words , the destruction of israel . this goal is identical to that of hezbollah 's patrons , syria and iran .
in the syrian capital , the exiled leader of hamas , khaled mashal , has taken up residence .
from there , he still actively works to prevent the elected hamas government from changing course toward more conciliatory politics .
and even though syria had to retreat from lebanon a year ago , it still remains present there via a strong ally : hezbollah . a chance to interfere iran is only too thankful for this opportunity : hamas , but more so hezbollah , has given tehran the ability to directly get involved in the israeli-palestinian conflict , without getting its own fingers burned .
and it is surely no coincidence that the syrian-iranian engagement got bigger right at the moment when - before the kidnapping of the soldier gilad shalit - signs were pointing to a rapprochement between fatah and hamas . the kidnapping of soldiers in the gaza strip and on the lebanese border is a tried and tested means of preventing any peace in the region .
damascus and tehran do n't want israel - something that can be heard from president ahmadinejad on an almost daily basis . nothing would upset them more than a gradual calm and normalization .

dw-world.de interviewed valentina matviyenko , mayor of president putin 's multi-cultural hometown . dw-world.de : which problems will be discussed during the s ummit ?
what will russia 's contribution look like , concerning issues like global energy security and viral epidemics , for example ? valentina matviyenko : generally , topics brought up at g8 summits are relevant for the world population .
you mentioned some of them already .
of course , russia wo n't just stand around and play the host .
as the state that holds the g8 presidency this year , we are preparing our proposals for all of the issues on the table .
i ca n't tell you what the proposals are yet . as far as energy security is concerned , russia - as a major distributor of energy - has the right to act as a trendsetter in this area and offer suggestions that will later be practically implemented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valentina matviyenko st. petersburg has always wrestled with moscow over being the capital city .
has the city at least become a cultural , financial or commercial - if not political - capital city since putin took office ? vladimir putin was born in st. petersburg .
no one else understands the role st. petersburg has played in the country , historically and today , like he does .
that 's why the city has had so many problems making its enormous economic , scientific and educational potential attractive for russia .
naturally , putin sees st. petersburg as the northern , european capital city . we have accomplished a lot .
our city is one of the most dynamically developing regions .
we have been able to achieve significant growth in leading economic sectors .
we have attracted investors and created transparent and fair conditions for the corporate world .
since the administrative court has started holding meetings here , the city 's image has improved accordingly . st. petersburg has been called " russia 's detroit " because automobile manufacturing giants like gm , toyota and nissan want to build factories in the city .
why are n't there any germany car companies in st. petersburg ? we have n't had any negotiations with volkswagen because their board did n't get in touch with us .
but we did negotiate with daimler chrysler .
why are n't they here ?
the luxury car maker wanted exclusive production rights .
however , we follow the russian laws for foreign car manufacturers entering the market .
the russian government did n't want to make changes to the law , even in the case of such a highly regarded company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 leaders will stay at the konstantin palace in st. petersburg this week other producers successfully came away from the negotiations .
numerous agreements have been signed and projects are currently in the works .
in addition , we are negotiating with a series of distribution and component production companies .
we seem to be creating a real auto industry in st. petersburg . as far as german companies go in general , they 're very active in st. petersburg .
knauf , bosch and siemens are currently putting up shop here .
german companies know and love st. petersburg . st. petersburg has been labeled " the capital of russian nationalism " .
how serious is the situation with racism there today ? people did in fact want to brand st. petersburg as a racist city , which does n't match the public opinion and the spirits of our residents here at all .
st. petersburg began as an international city .
over 100 nationalities and ethnic groups and all kinds of different religions are represented here . in our 300-year history there have never been conflicts based on where people came from .
however , the accusations have intensified now just before the g8 summit and , unfortunately , some people in the media have adopted these speculations . nonetheless , xenophobia and nationalism are also present here , just as they are in every other country , especially in metropolitan areas . sergei morosov interviewed valentina matviyenko -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian turn at g8 helm seen as leadership test russia will take over the presidency of the g8 states for the first time in 2006 , despite the country 's questionable status in the club of the eight wealthiest nations .

robert jones and agnes hunt orthopaedic hospital -lrb- rjah -rrb- in shropshire says it has treated more welsh patients this year than it has been paid for .
it said 1,400 patients from powys would be referred to other hospitals unless the problem was resolved .
powys local health board -lrb- lhb -rrb- said it was unable to comment at the moment . "
unfortunately our hands are tied as we have a statutory duty to stay within our budgets " heather lewis , hospital finance director the hospital in gobowen , near oswestry , is only a few miles from wales , and about 40 % of its patients - thought to run into the thousands - are from powys and north wales .
but it said an estimated 600 patients on waiting lists and a further 800 out-patients from powys could be referred to other hospitals unless it received more money .
rjah trust finance director heather lewis said : " it must be very distressing for patients from powys to find that their lhb will not pay for their treatment here .
" unfortunately our hands are tied as we have a statutory duty to stay within our budgets and remain financially viable . "
the hospital said it would hold talks with the lhb next week .
powys lhb said it would make a full statement about the situation on monday .

" never in my wildest nightmares did i think they would be refused access to ' our hospital ' at gobowen , " said mr davies .
montgomeryshire liberal democrat am mick bates said he had spoken to welsh health minister brian gibbons about the problem several times .
" the lhb has no money to pay for operations and the people who are going to suffer are my constituents , " he said .
on monday , mr davies criticised a decision by the shrewsbury and telford hospitals nhs trust to delay announcing how to repay a £ 30m debt .
its hospital in shrewsbury treats about 50,000 people from north powys and there are fears services could be cut .
a welsh assembly government spokesman said it had kept in contact with the department of health about the impact of charges from english hospitals on the nhs in wales .
he added : " agreement has been reached with the department of health that cross-border activity between england and wales will not be subject to the english tariff in 2006-07 , and guidance issued by both the department of health and the welsh assembly government confirms this agreement . "

robert jones and agnes hunt orthopaedic hospital -lrb- rjah -rrb- in shropshire says it has treated more welsh patients this year than it has been paid for .
it said 1,400 patients from powys would be referred to other hospitals unless the problem was resolved .
powys local health board -lrb- lhb -rrb- said it was unable to comment at the moment .
unfortunately our hands are tied as we have a statutory duty to stay within our budgets heather lewis , hospital finance director the hospital in gobowen , near oswestry , is only a few miles from wales , and about 40 % of its patients - thought to run into the thousands - are from powys and north wales .
but it said an estimated 600 patients on waiting lists and a further 800 out-patients from powys could be referred to other hospitals unless it received more money .
rjah trust finance director heather lewis said : " it must be very distressing for patients from powys to find that their lhb will not pay for their treatment here .
" unfortunately our hands are tied as we have a statutory duty to stay within our budgets and remain financially viable . "
the hospital said it would hold talks with the lhb next week .
powys lhb said it would make a full statement about the situation on monday .
' wildest nightmares ' conservative mid and west wales am glyn davies said the nhs in powys was " disintegrating before our very eyes " .
the lhb has no money to pay for operations and the people who are going to suffer are my constituents mick bates , montgomeryshire am he said he was told last week by first minister rhodri morgan " that patients from powys may not in future be referred to the royal shrewsbury hospital because it is in england " .
" never in my wildest nightmares did i think they would be refused access to ' our hospital ' at gobowen , " said mr davies .
montgomeryshire liberal democrat am mick bates said he had spoken to welsh health minister brian gibbons about the problem several times .
" the lhb has no money to pay for operations and the people who are going to suffer are my constituents , " he said .
on monday , mr davies criticised a decision by the shrewsbury and telford hospitals nhs trust to delay announcing how to repay a £ 30m debt .
its hospital in shrewsbury treats about 50,000 people from north powys and there are fears services could be cut .
a welsh assembly government spokesman said it had kept in contact with the department of health about the impact of charges from english hospitals on the nhs in wales .
he added : " agreement has been reached with the department of health that cross-border activity between england and wales will not be subject to the english tariff in 2006-07 , and guidance issued by both the department of health and the welsh assembly government confirms this agreement . "

she describes the excitement of the first night .
' for any of you who have n't sung in the proms before , i can tell you it 's the first night that is the most exciting , not the last , ' said our chorus director stephen jackson , breaking off from talking about the importance of pronunciation during a rehearsal of dvorak 's te deum last week .
from that point on , i started to feel the anticipation .
people around me - some of whom had been singing in the proms for years - seemed to raise their levels in rehearsals , as the thought of the royal albert hall stage set in .
professional technique from my seat second row from the back on stage , almost directly in front of the conductor , i could see faces in the packed audience - and they looked thrilled to be there .
many had paid just for the chance to stand .
but those standing at the front had a view i would have appreciated - just a few feet from the soprano soloist .
the magnificent barbara frittoli filled the hall with pure notes , each as good as the last , and a wonderful vibrato .
it is always useful to watch the professional 's technique - i would have liked to see how she prepared for each phrase , how she moved up to the higher notes .
but we enjoyed her great sound , together with sir john tomlinson 's rich bass for the solo in te deum .
frittoli received passionate applause for her performances from mozart 's marriage of figaro and don giovanni .
then came the swelling melodies of smetana 's my country , which kept me hooked and my mind off the approach of our performance of te deum immediately after .
extra dynamism our conductor on the night was jiri behlohlavek , the new czech chief conductor of the bbc symphony orchestra .
he seemed to revel in the opportunity to bring to attention a lesser-performed work from his home country 's best-loved composer .
jiri belohlavek conducted the first night te deum , whose text comes from a latin hymn , is smaller in scale than the famous stabat mater and requiem , but the music is beautiful , eulogistic .
when we rehearsed with behlohlavek for the first time a few days ago , i was struck by his mild-mannered nature .
but with concert dress comes an extra dynamism and aggression - from the performers and conductor .
works rehearsed for weeks are over in a flash .
nothing went wrong and our te deum seemed to go as planned .
only the final cry of allelujah ! came too soon .
it 's natural to look for the conductor 's reaction .
and jiri behlohlavek was smiling warmly .
our own chorus master , stephen jackson , who prepares us for the proms , had on occasions seemed less satisfied in preparation - once tossing his music into the air in apparent frustration during the final rehearsal with the conductor .
during the last week he had been urging more out of us .
after our performance i passed him backstage to a cheery ' well done , folks ' .
there 'll be praise when we meet for our next rehearsal , i am sure .
few more anxieties after the interval , while listening to the bbc symphony chorus 's impressive performance of shostakovich 's symphony no. 5 in d minor , television cameras caught my attention and reminded me that this was a major event .
various bbc luminaries were milling around with wine glasses afterwards , soaking up the post-concert atmosphere .
the proms are known and loved by thousands .
they bring the best classical music talent to as many people as possible .
for me it was a chance to work with people better than i , and to learn more and more about singing , which i took up two years ago .
this is the first choir i have ever sung with , so i probably had a few more anxieties than most .
they mainly centred around making some kind of mistake .
but i knew the piece well enough for that not to happen .
and then there is concert etiquette - making sure i was standing and sitting at the right times , that i knew when and how to get to my seat , that i was n't late , that my blouse was n't too low cut , and so on .
concert dress for the chorus is all black - and very formal .
ankle-length skirt or dress , long sleeves , black tights and subtle jewellery only .
in other words , no flesh on display .
colours and short-sleeves are permitted as a long-awaited last night of the proms reward .
there was only one negative point for me : when i scanned the audience , the faces looking back were almost universally white .
but my overriding memory will be an involvement in something special and valued , and of enjoyment .
for the last week te deum has swirled around in my head - but it 'll soon be replaced by prokofiev in preparation for our next prom on 29 july .
there 's a lot more fun and good experiences to come this summer , right up to the last night on 9 september .

she describes the excitement of the first night .
' for any of you who have n't sung in the proms before , i can tell you it 's the first night that is the most exciting , not the last , ' said our chorus director stephen jackson , breaking off from talking about the importance of pronunciation during a rehearsal of dvorak 's te deum last week .
from that point on , i started to feel the anticipation .
people around me - some of whom had been singing in the proms for years - seemed to raise their levels in rehearsals , as the thought of the royal albert hall stage set in .
professional technique from my seat second row from the back on stage , almost directly in front of the conductor , i could see faces in the packed audience - and they looked thrilled to be there .
many had paid just for the chance to stand .
but those standing at the front had a view i would have appreciated - just a few feet from the soprano soloist .
the magnificent barbara frittoli filled the hall with pure notes , each as good as the last , and a wonderful vibrato .
it is always useful to watch the professional 's technique - i would have liked to see how she prepared for each phrase , how she moved up to the higher notes .
but we enjoyed her great sound , together with sir john tomlinson 's rich bass for the solo in te deum .
frittoli received passionate applause for her performances from mozart 's marriage of figaro and don giovanni .
then came the swelling melodies of smetana 's my country , which kept me hooked and my mind off the approach of our performance of te deum immediately after .
extra dynamism our conductor on the night was jiri behlohlavek , the new czech chief conductor of the bbc symphony orchestra .
he seemed to revel in the opportunity to bring to attention a lesser-performed work from his home country 's best-loved composer .
jiri belohlavek conducted the first night te deum , whose text comes from a latin hymn , is smaller in scale than the famous stabat mater and requiem , but the music is beautiful , eulogistic .
when we rehearsed with behlohlavek for the first time a few days ago , i was struck by his mild-mannered nature .
but with concert dress comes an extra dynamism and aggression - from the performers and conductor .
works rehearsed for weeks are over in a flash .
nothing went wrong and our te deum seemed to go as planned .
only the final cry of allelujah ! came too soon .
it 's natural to look for the conductor 's reaction .
and jiri behlohlavek was smiling warmly .
our own chorus master , stephen jackson , who prepares us for the proms , had on occasions seemed less satisfied in preparation - once tossing his music into the air in apparent frustration during the final rehearsal with the conductor .
during the last week he had been urging more out of us .
after our performance i passed him backstage to a cheery ' well done , folks ' .
there 'll be praise when we meet for our next rehearsal , i am sure .
few more anxieties after the interval , while listening to the bbc symphony chorus 's impressive performance of shostakovich 's symphony no. 5 in d minor , television cameras caught my attention and reminded me that this was a major event .
various bbc luminaries were milling around with wine glasses afterwards , soaking up the post-concert atmosphere .
the proms are known and loved by thousands .
they bring the best classical music talent to as many people as possible .
for me it was a chance to work with people better than i , and to learn more and more about singing , which i took up two years ago .
this is the first choir i have ever sung with , so i probably had a few more anxieties than most .
they mainly centred around making some kind of mistake .
but i knew the piece well enough for that not to happen .
and then there is concert etiquette - making sure i was standing and sitting at the right times , that i knew when and how to get to my seat , that i was n't late , that my blouse was n't too low cut , and so on .
concert dress for the chorus is all black - and very formal .
ankle-length skirt or dress , long sleeves , black tights and subtle jewellery only .
in other words , no flesh on display .
colours and short-sleeves are permitted as a long-awaited last night of the proms reward .
there was only one negative point for me : when i scanned the audience , the faces looking back were almost universally white .
but my overriding memory will be an involvement in something special and valued , and of enjoyment .
for the last week te deum has swirled around in my head - but it 'll soon be replaced by prokofiev in preparation for our next prom on 29 july .
there 's a lot more fun and good experiences to come this summer , right up to the last night on 9 september .

the proms are known and loved by thousands .
they bring the best classical music talent to as many people as possible .
for me it was a chance to work with people better than i , and to learn more and more about singing , which i took up two years ago .
this is the first choir i have ever sung with , so i probably had a few more anxieties than most .
they mainly centred around making some kind of mistake .
but i knew the piece well enough for that not to happen .
and then there is concert etiquette - making sure i was standing and sitting at the right times , that i knew when and how to get to my seat , that i was n't late , that my blouse was n't too low cut , and so on .
concert dress for the chorus is all black - and very formal .
ankle-length skirt or dress , long sleeves , black tights and subtle jewellery only .
in other words , no flesh on display .
colours and short-sleeves are permitted as a long-awaited last night of the proms reward .
there was only one negative point for me : when i scanned the audience , the faces looking back were almost universally white .
but my overriding memory will be an involvement in something special and valued , and of enjoyment .
for the last week te deum has swirled around in my head - but it 'll soon be replaced by prokofiev in preparation for our next prom on 29 july .
there 's a lot more fun and good experiences to come this summer , right up to the last night on 9 september .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- taking the stage for proms night bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture saturday , 15 july 2006 , 09:30 gmt 10:30 uk taking the stage for proms night the bbc news website 's alison smith is performing in the bbc proms for the first time with the bbc symphony chorus .
she describes the excitement of the first night . "
' for any of you who have n't sung in the proms before , i can tell you it 's the first night that is the most exciting , not the last , ' said our chorus director stephen jackson , breaking off from talking about the importance of pronunciation during a rehearsal of dvorak 's te deum last week .
from that point on , i started to feel the anticipation .
people around me - some of whom had been singing in the proms for years - seemed to raise their levels in rehearsals , as the thought of the royal albert hall stage set in .
professional technique from my seat second row from the back on stage , almost directly in front of the conductor , i could see faces in the packed audience - and they looked thrilled to be there .
many had paid just for the chance to stand .
but those standing at the front had a view i would have appreciated - just a few feet from the soprano soloist .
the magnificent barbara frittoli filled the hall with pure notes , each as good as the last , and a wonderful vibrato .
it is always useful to watch the professional 's technique - i would have liked to see how she prepared for each phrase , how she moved up to the higher notes .
but we enjoyed her great sound , together with sir john tomlinson 's rich bass for the solo in te deum .
frittoli received passionate applause for her performances from mozart 's marriage of figaro and don giovanni .
then came the swelling melodies of smetana 's my country , which kept me hooked and my mind off the approach of our performance of te deum immediately after .
extra dynamism our conductor on the night was jiri behlohlavek , the new czech chief conductor of the bbc symphony orchestra .
he seemed to revel in the opportunity to bring to attention a lesser-performed work from his home country 's best-loved composer .
te deum , whose text comes from a latin hymn , is smaller in scale than the famous stabat mater and requiem , but the music is beautiful , eulogistic .
when we rehearsed with behlohlavek for the first time a few days ago , i was struck by his mild-mannered nature .
but with concert dress comes an extra dynamism and aggression - from the performers and conductor .
works rehearsed for weeks are over in a flash .
nothing went wrong and our te deum seemed to go as planned .
only the final cry of allelujah ! came too soon .
it 's natural to look for the conductor 's reaction .
and jiri behlohlavek was smiling warmly .
our own chorus master , stephen jackson , who prepares us for the proms , had on occasions seemed less satisfied in preparation - once tossing his music into the air in apparent frustration during the final rehearsal with the conductor .
during the last week he had been urging more out of us .
after our performance i passed him backstage to a cheery ' well done , folks ' .
there 'll be praise when we meet for our next rehearsal , i am sure .
few more anxieties after the interval , while listening to the bbc symphony chorus 's impressive performance of shostakovich 's symphony no. 5 in d minor , television cameras caught my attention and reminded me that this was a major event .
various bbc luminaries were milling around with wine glasses afterwards , soaking up the post-concert atmosphere .

i would like a simpler tax system , easier to understand and cheaper to collect " mark , newcastle i would like a simpler tax system , easier to understand and cheaper to collect .
i would like a fairer tax system -lrb- if there is such a thing -rrb- .
i have a real problem with stamp duty on house purchases , a sliding scale would be much better .
i hate inheritance tax , it is duplcating tax , you have already earned the money and been taxed on it and been taxed on it again at the worst time .
mark , newcastle did i hear the hmrc representative call taxpayers ' customers ' ?
this is nonsense as it implies choice-i would like to pay my tax to the collector who only wants a flat 10 % please .
the correct term for the relationship of the taxpayer to hmrc is ' victim ' .
if they do have a customer then it is the treasury , certainly not the unfortunate source of the product of their operations .

her tax position should be simple : she receives and occupational pension , a state pension and has modest bank interst and some dividends .
however , the ir make the entire issue incredibly complex .
the tax collection is in substantial arrears every year .
the woman was very distressed about the mess and confusion .
how are pensioners meant to cope when they have no-one to help out .
the fault lies with the increasingly complex tax system .
graeme , edinburgh i have been self employed for over 25 years , and have had several encounters with the ladies and gentlemen employed by inland revenue -lrb- now hm revenue and customs -rrb- .
with the benefit of an economics degree , i would feel fully confident in understanding the simple principles involved in filling a tax form .
i was especially interested in the section of your programme where you said there were people deliberately understating their expenses for fear of falling foul of an investigation .
despite my ' economics ' training , i fall into that category .
in outline , this is because i have found the revenue 's approach so utterly illogical , and even , i would claim , quite dishonest when they are dealing with an individual , that i no longer feel that reasoned honest argument can prevail against their superior power .
alan , worcestershire i lived and worked in the uk all my life , paying paye and dreading the tax man - for no good reason as i never had a problem .
in 2001 i moved to switzerland where i also have to paye for the first 5 years and submit a tax return that is so complicated it is almost uunbelievable - even the 3 local authorities that grab my hard earned dough manage to mess things up severly , resulting in £ 2500 demands by return of post from one branch and over payment of a similar ammount to another branch that is to be off set against next year -lrb- which they never correct for in the paye for the following year -rrb- .
i also have to submit a uk tax return , and one year made a mistake that resulted in a very high tax demand from the inland revenue .
a short telephone call to the tax office quickly identified my error , a few button presses my the very amenable gentlman in the tax office rectified it and a new calculation -lrb- and a return of moneys paid -rrb- followed virtually by return of post .
no matter how much uk residents may complain about the service they get or how evil they think the tax man is they ought to thank their lucky stars that they dont have the swiss service !
peter , switzerland being self employed i pay income tax , nics and vat .
i have always found the vat simple and the vat inspectors helpful .
on the other hand income tax is incredible complex and is getiing more so .
the tax inspectors are unhelpful and lack knowledge .
now that the cutoms & excise and the ir have merged does it mean that income tax will now get simpler or as i suspect vat will become incredibly complex .

a new hm revenue & customs scheme aims to help taxpayers who 've completed forms incorrectly .
hmrc say that trials of the new system aim to explore simpler and faster ways of helping taxpayers , particularly for those likely to make mistakes in relation to their tax .
what are your thoughts and experiences ?
are you happy with the way your tax is collected ?
how might the present system be improved ?
read a selection of your comments below .
i would like a simpler tax system , easier to understand and cheaper to collect mark , newcastle i would like a simpler tax system , easier to understand and cheaper to collect .
i would like a fairer tax system -lrb- if there is such a thing -rrb- .
i have a real problem with stamp duty on house purchases , a sliding scale would be much better .
i hate inheritance tax , it is duplcating tax , you have already earned the money and been taxed on it and been taxed on it again at the worst time .
mark , newcastle did i hear the hmrc representative call taxpayers ' customers ' ?
this is nonsense as it implies choice-i would like to pay my tax to the collector who only wants a flat 10 % please .
the correct term for the relationship of the taxpayer to hmrc is ' victim ' .
if they do have a customer then it is the treasury , certainly not the unfortunate source of the product of their operations .
roger , stockport how are pensioners meant to cope when they have no-one to help out graeme , edinburgh i think the current system is a disgrace .
i regularly assist a widowed pensioner with her tax affairs .
her tax position should be simple : she receives and occupational pension , a state pension and has modest bank interst and some dividends .
however , the ir make the entire issue incredibly complex .
the tax collection is in substantial arrears every year .
the woman was very distressed about the mess and confusion .
how are pensioners meant to cope when they have no-one to help out .
the fault lies with the increasingly complex tax system .
graeme , edinburgh i have been self employed for over 25 years , and have had several encounters with the ladies and gentlemen employed by inland revenue -lrb- now hm revenue and customs -rrb- .
with the benefit of an economics degree , i would feel fully confident in understanding the simple principles involved in filling a tax form .
i was especially interested in the section of your programme where you said there were people deliberately understating their expenses for fear of falling foul of an investigation .
despite my ' economics ' training , i fall into that category .
in outline , this is because i have found the revenue 's approach so utterly illogical , and even , i would claim , quite dishonest when they are dealing with an individual , that i no longer feel that reasoned honest argument can prevail against their superior power .
alan , worcestershire i lived and worked in the uk all my life , paying paye and dreading the tax man - for no good reason as i never had a problem .
in 2001 i moved to switzerland where i also have to paye for the first 5 years and submit a tax return that is so complicated it is almost uunbelievable - even the 3 local authorities that grab my hard earned dough manage to mess things up severly , resulting in £ 2500 demands by return of post from one branch and over payment of a similar ammount to another branch that is to be off set against next year -lrb- which they never correct for in the paye for the following year -rrb- .
i also have to submit a uk tax return , and one year made a mistake that resulted in a very high tax demand from the inland revenue .
a short telephone call to the tax office quickly identified my error , a few button presses my the very amenable gentlman in the tax office rectified it and a new calculation -lrb- and a return of moneys paid -rrb- followed virtually by return of post .
no matter how much uk residents may complain about the service they get or how evil they think the tax man is they ought to thank their lucky stars that they dont have the swiss service !
peter , switzerland being self employed i pay income tax , nics and vat .
i have always found the vat simple and the vat inspectors helpful .
on the other hand income tax is incredible complex and is getiing more so .
the tax inspectors are unhelpful and lack knowledge .
now that the cutoms & excise and the ir have merged does it mean that income tax will now get simpler or as i suspect vat will become incredibly complex .
