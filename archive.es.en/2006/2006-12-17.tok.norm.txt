seven minutes later at the other end , miroslav klose saw his shot from six meters brilliantly blocked by wolfsburg goalkeeper simon jentzsch . klose also had a weak shot saved by jentzsch before daniel jensen scored with an overhead kick in the 17th minute after wolfsburg failed to clear their lines . bremen had a great chance to go further in front on 34 minutes when awarded a penalty after diego was adjudged to have been fouled in the area but the midfielder fired the resultant spot kick against the foot of the post and wide . wolfsburg made bremen pay four minutes before the break when isaac boakye lobbed a shot over wiese from eight meters . naldo nearly restored bremen 's lead in the 68th minute but jentzsch parried the brazilian 's fierce free kick .
however , jentzsch was rooted to the spot in the 86th minute when naldo fired in an unstoppable shot from another well-worked free kick from the edge of the area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's nuri sahin -lrb- left -rrb- and leverkusen 's andrej voronin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium , bayer leverkusen meanwhile totally outclassed the home side and were fully deserving of their 2-1 win .
andrey voronin put the visitors in front on 24 minutes before substitute stefan kiessling made it 2-1 with a fine counter-attacking goal with 14 minutes remaining . martin amedick pulled one back for dortmund in the 85th minute but it turned out to be too little too late . dortmund 's defeat will increase the pressure on coach bert van marwijk to leave during the winter break rather than at the end of the season as he has already announced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach jürgen klopp will have a lot of cheerleading to do in 2007 mainz will spend christmas in last place with 11 points after the loss to munich , two points shy of hamburg and four points behind borussia mönchengladbach . mönchengladbach lost 2-0 at vfl bochum on friday while hamburg drew 3-3 with alemannia aachen despite leading 3-1 .

seven minutes later at the other end , miroslav klose saw his shot from six meters brilliantly blocked by wolfsburg goalkeeper simon jentzsch . klose also had a weak shot saved by jentzsch before daniel jensen scored with an overhead kick in the 17th minute after wolfsburg failed to clear their lines . bremen had a great chance to go further in front on 34 minutes when awarded a penalty after diego was adjudged to have been fouled in the area but the midfielder fired the resultant spot kick against the foot of the post and wide . wolfsburg made bremen pay four minutes before the break when isaac boakye lobbed a shot over wiese from eight meters . naldo nearly restored bremen 's lead in the 68th minute but jentzsch parried the brazilian 's fierce free kick .
however , jentzsch was rooted to the spot in the 86th minute when naldo fired in an unstoppable shot from another well-worked free kick from the edge of the area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's nuri sahin -lrb- left -rrb- and leverkusen 's andrej voronin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium , bayer leverkusen meanwhile totally outclassed the home side and were fully deserving of their 2-1 win .
andrey voronin put the visitors in front on 24 minutes before substitute stefan kiessling made it 2-1 with a fine counter-attacking goal with 14 minutes remaining . martin amedick pulled one back for dortmund in the 85th minute but it turned out to be too little too late . dortmund 's defeat will increase the pressure on coach bert van marwijk to leave during the winter break rather than at the end of the season as he has already announced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach jürgen klopp will have a lot of cheerleading to do in 2007 mainz will spend christmas in last place with 11 points after the loss to munich , two points shy of hamburg and four points behind borussia mönchengladbach . mönchengladbach lost 2-0 at vfl bochum on friday while hamburg drew 3-3 with alemannia aachen despite leading 3-1 .

the government hopes to use its eu presidency to make advances in this area . germany has already vowed to make energy a top priority when it takes over the eu presidency next month .
one of its aims is to examine africa 's particular problems in this area .
with some 535 million people across the continent currently without access to electricity , government development experts say better provision is the key to tackling poverty . high gas , oil and electricity prices are curbing growth in many african states that do n't have natural resources that provide energy .
this extra financial burden is using up funds that are desperately needed for other , more pressing purposes .
the rise in the cost of crude oil imports now almost outweighs the entire international aid budget . in african oil-producing countries , such as nigeria , the picture is a little different .
not only are their exports worth more , production here is also on the rise .
in west africa alone , it increased by 36 percent over the last 10 years .
however , corruption and poor government often mean profits are frequently not used to aid social and economic development . european energy strategy europe 's energy strategy is not sufficiently tied to its aid and development policies , said manfred konukiewitz , a senior official in the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could help africa to make sure revenues from natural resources benefit society " we should not merely view african countries as warehouses for crude oil or gas , or other resources , we should also make these african partners an offer about how to use and develop their own resources in the best possible way for the development of their countries , " konukiewitz said . europe could help promote transparency in african oil-producing states by copying models such as that adopted by the world bank in chad for the construction of the chad-cameroon pipeline , he said .
there the government agreed to earmark part of the extra revenue that would be generated by the pipeline for development purposes as part of the investment deal . promoting renewable energy the german government also wants to promote renewable energies in africa .
ninety percent of people there use traditional biomass to produce energy , usually by burning charcoal and wood .
however , more efficient renewable technologies , such as solar , geothermal , wind and hydroelectric power are also in operation .
the room for expansion is great , according to experts . # b # hydroelectric power provides 96 percent of electricity in 11 african countries .
small decentralized power plants can provide cheap , environmentally friendly electricity to rural areas .
the construction of major dams , such as in china , are looked upon less favorably these days , partly due to their environmental impact .
however , not all international investors are willing to adhere to the guidelines formulated by the world conservation union and the world bank , konukiewitz said . berlin 's push to promote renewable energies is also not likely to please everyone in africa .
but konukiewitz said the general trend was positive .
" one african energy minister told me : our people want the white man 's energy , and she meant the electricity from the socket where the energy has come from a traditional power plant .
i think this view is slowly changing in africa . " dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german eu presidency germany will take over the rotating eu presidency on jan .

german dubbers as hollywood 's unsung heros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german , bogart says " look into my eyes , babe " rather than " here 's lookin ' at you , kid " in german , julia roberts is a different kind of sexy .
her " pretty woman " character 's lines are translated , just like in other hollywood films .
ever since world war ii , germans have had a love affair with dubbing films . dubbing means that every word of script in a movie is re-written and recorded in a foreign language .
the method is also known as " synchronization " because the new dialogue is supposed to sync up with the original actor 's mouth . german actors get linked to a hollywood star for the duration of that star 's career .
christian brückner , for instance , is a household name .
that 's because he is the german " voice " for robert de niro .
he also voice-acts parts played by warren beatty , harvey keitel , dennis hopper and marlon brando . other voice actors , however , are unsung heroes .
you would likely not recognize them on the street because they work behind the scenes . " dub city " berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " robert de niro " : voice christian brückner germany 's dubbing heartland is berlin , where recording companies vie to synchronize everything from tv commercials and sitcoms to the latest hollywood blockbuster . casting agent thomas fremd , sitting at his desk behind a vast pile of recording schedules with highlighted names , knows how to match voices with faces . " we have 30 dubbing companies in berlin and all of them use the same actors so it 's important to catch the right ones at the right time , " fremd said . a good actor , fremd believes , can see a character played one time by a star and immediately interpret him or her for a german audience . shattered illusions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice actors rarely get the red-carpet treatment in berlin but just how far does one go when matching voice to face ?
are all those screen sirens and hollywood hunks just as sexy in their german counterparts ?
or as similar in other ways to the original actor ? likeness is relative , especially if you consider that there are no black dubbing actors in germany , so big stars like denzel washington , halle berry and morgan freeman are all played by white voice actors . rainer raschevski has been in the business for 16 years and runs a big studio in berlin called media factory .
when he was starting out as a young sound engineer all those years ago , he was shocked to see the famous actors unmasked .
" the first day i came into the company restaurant , i heard the german ' john wayne ' order a beer behind me , " raschevski said .
" i was impressed until i turned around to see the guy and he looked completely different than the original .
it 's kind of said for the voice actors .
no one knows that they do one hell of a job . " acting pains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does color matter ?
halle berry 's german counterpart is a white woman dubbing actors have to speak at exactly the same time as their screen persona .
if they end just a second too late , the scene has to be recorded again . and , not only are they lip-syncing the german lines , they also have to mimic the inflections of the original actor . yet despite versatility in acting and portraying a range of emotions , one of the biggest complaints about dubbing is that is like a cultural homogeniser - a kind of machine where the world 's rich cultural vibrancy goes in one end and a world in which everyone speaks perfect german comes out the other . for hollywood films , script adaptor alexander löwe said that to convey the original meaning in a film , it is vital to have a rich understanding of both the english language and american culture . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia roberts is charming even in german but then there are always cultural traps , like translating hip hop lingo such " fo ' shizzle my nizzle -lrb- some say it means " for sure , my nigger " -rrb- or conveying a joke that relies on a pun . one case in particular is the movie " terminal , " starring tom hanks , about a man - " viktor navorski " - who is supposedly from a former russian state and is forced to live in an american airport because he doesn ’ t have a valid passport . viktor has a very strong accent in the film and during one scene , he is trying to explain to a young man that some woman is being cheated on by her husband .
he says " he cheat , he cheat , he cheat . " the young guy , because he only understands spanish and some crude english , understands " eat shit , eat shit , eat shit . " as löwe points out , " you just ca n't get that funny misunderstanding across .
you ca n't translate that . " a picture says a thousand words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faceless , german dubbing actors would never make tinseltown in addition to things getting lost in translation , another source of dubbing frustration for viewers is watching faces that move out of sync with the voices they hear . because in german it usually takes more words to say something than in english , the adaptors have to come up with a german sentence as short as in english , without losing the meaning , and which roughly matches up with the on-screen actor 's mouth . yet even if the synchronization is off-track , it is still a minor complaint compared to a poor translation . one of the most famous mistakes is in the classic hollywood film " casablanca . "
in the original , humphrey bogart 's character says to love interest ingrid bergman " here 's looking at you , kid ... "
but in the german version , he says " look into my eyes , babe ... "
-lrb- schau ' mir in die augen , kleines . -rrb-
a mistake like that would never happen again , löwe said , since us supervisors come to germany to make sure the translations are correct as the films are being synchronized . " once they realized that ' acid head ' in the movie ' apocalypse now " had been translated literally , " löwe said .
" the translator used the german words for ' acid ' and ' head ' - he did n't have a clue that the name meant an lsd junkie . " so , to avoid really horrible translation blunders like " look into my trippin ' out eyes , acid babe " or " i concur whole-heartedly , my african-american brother " -lrb- as the " urban dictionary " says for " fo ' shizzle my nizzle " -rrb- , better watch it in the original . zoie jones / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips : a world cup mystery unfolds forget about law or medicine .

german dubbers as hollywood 's unsung heros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german , bogart says " look into my eyes , babe " rather than " here 's lookin ' at you , kid " in german , julia roberts is a different kind of sexy .
her " pretty woman " character 's lines are translated , just like in other hollywood films .
ever since world war ii , germans have had a love affair with dubbing films . dubbing means that every word of script in a movie is re-written and recorded in a foreign language .
the method is also known as " synchronization " because the new dialogue is supposed to sync up with the original actor 's mouth . german actors get linked to a hollywood star for the duration of that star 's career .
christian brückner , for instance , is a household name .
that 's because he is the german " voice " for robert de niro .
he also voice-acts parts played by warren beatty , harvey keitel , dennis hopper and marlon brando . other voice actors , however , are unsung heroes .
you would likely not recognize them on the street because they work behind the scenes . " dub city " berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " robert de niro " : voice christian brückner germany 's dubbing heartland is berlin , where recording companies vie to synchronize everything from tv commercials and sitcoms to the latest hollywood blockbuster . casting agent thomas fremd , sitting at his desk behind a vast pile of recording schedules with highlighted names , knows how to match voices with faces . " we have 30 dubbing companies in berlin and all of them use the same actors so it 's important to catch the right ones at the right time , " fremd said . a good actor , fremd believes , can see a character played one time by a star and immediately interpret him or her for a german audience . shattered illusions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice actors rarely get the red-carpet treatment in berlin but just how far does one go when matching voice to face ?
are all those screen sirens and hollywood hunks just as sexy in their german counterparts ?
or as similar in other ways to the original actor ? likeness is relative , especially if you consider that there are no black dubbing actors in germany , so big stars like denzel washington , halle berry and morgan freeman are all played by white voice actors . rainer raschevski has been in the business for 16 years and runs a big studio in berlin called media factory .
when he was starting out as a young sound engineer all those years ago , he was shocked to see the famous actors unmasked .
" the first day i came into the company restaurant , i heard the german ' john wayne ' order a beer behind me , " raschevski said .
" i was impressed until i turned around to see the guy and he looked completely different than the original .
it 's kind of said for the voice actors .
no one knows that they do one hell of a job . " acting pains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does color matter ?
halle berry 's german counterpart is a white woman dubbing actors have to speak at exactly the same time as their screen persona .
if they end just a second too late , the scene has to be recorded again . and , not only are they lip-syncing the german lines , they also have to mimic the inflections of the original actor . yet despite versatility in acting and portraying a range of emotions , one of the biggest complaints about dubbing is that is like a cultural homogeniser - a kind of machine where the world 's rich cultural vibrancy goes in one end and a world in which everyone speaks perfect german comes out the other . for hollywood films , script adaptor alexander löwe said that to convey the original meaning in a film , it is vital to have a rich understanding of both the english language and american culture . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia roberts is charming even in german but then there are always cultural traps , like translating hip hop lingo such " fo ' shizzle my nizzle -lrb- some say it means " for sure , my nigger " -rrb- or conveying a joke that relies on a pun . one case in particular is the movie " terminal , " starring tom hanks , about a man - " viktor navorski " - who is supposedly from a former russian state and is forced to live in an american airport because he doesn ’ t have a valid passport . viktor has a very strong accent in the film and during one scene , he is trying to explain to a young man that some woman is being cheated on by her husband .
he says " he cheat , he cheat , he cheat . " the young guy , because he only understands spanish and some crude english , understands " eat shit , eat shit , eat shit . " as löwe points out , " you just ca n't get that funny misunderstanding across .
you ca n't translate that . " a picture says a thousand words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faceless , german dubbing actors would never make tinseltown in addition to things getting lost in translation , another source of dubbing frustration for viewers is watching faces that move out of sync with the voices they hear . because in german it usually takes more words to say something than in english , the adaptors have to come up with a german sentence as short as in english , without losing the meaning , and which roughly matches up with the on-screen actor 's mouth . yet even if the synchronization is off-track , it is still a minor complaint compared to a poor translation . one of the most famous mistakes is in the classic hollywood film " casablanca . "
in the original , humphrey bogart 's character says to love interest ingrid bergman " here 's looking at you , kid ... "
but in the german version , he says " look into my eyes , babe ... "
-lrb- schau ' mir in die augen , kleines . -rrb-
a mistake like that would never happen again , löwe said , since us supervisors come to germany to make sure the translations are correct as the films are being synchronized . " once they realized that ' acid head ' in the movie ' apocalypse now " had been translated literally , " löwe said .
" the translator used the german words for ' acid ' and ' head ' - he did n't have a clue that the name meant an lsd junkie . " so , to avoid really horrible translation blunders like " look into my trippin ' out eyes , acid babe " or " i concur whole-heartedly , my african-american brother " -lrb- as the " urban dictionary " says for " fo ' shizzle my nizzle " -rrb- , better watch it in the original . zoie jones / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips : a world cup mystery unfolds forget about law or medicine .

the government hopes to use its eu presidency to make advances in this area . germany has already vowed to make energy a top priority when it takes over the eu presidency next month .
one of its aims is to examine africa 's particular problems in this area .
with some 535 million people across the continent currently without access to electricity , government development experts say better provision is the key to tackling poverty . high gas , oil and electricity prices are curbing growth in many african states that do n't have natural resources that provide energy .
this extra financial burden is using up funds that are desperately needed for other , more pressing purposes .
the rise in the cost of crude oil imports now almost outweighs the entire international aid budget . in african oil-producing countries , such as nigeria , the picture is a little different .
not only are their exports worth more , production here is also on the rise .
in west africa alone , it increased by 36 percent over the last 10 years .
however , corruption and poor government often mean profits are frequently not used to aid social and economic development . european energy strategy europe 's energy strategy is not sufficiently tied to its aid and development policies , said manfred konukiewitz , a senior official in the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could help africa to make sure revenues from natural resources benefit society " we should not merely view african countries as warehouses for crude oil or gas , or other resources , we should also make these african partners an offer about how to use and develop their own resources in the best possible way for the development of their countries , " konukiewitz said . europe could help promote transparency in african oil-producing states by copying models such as that adopted by the world bank in chad for the construction of the chad-cameroon pipeline , he said .
there the government agreed to earmark part of the extra revenue that would be generated by the pipeline for development purposes as part of the investment deal . promoting renewable energy the german government also wants to promote renewable energies in africa .
ninety percent of people there use traditional biomass to produce energy , usually by burning charcoal and wood .
however , more efficient renewable technologies , such as solar , geothermal , wind and hydroelectric power are also in operation .
the room for expansion is great , according to experts . # b # hydroelectric power provides 96 percent of electricity in 11 african countries .
small decentralized power plants can provide cheap , environmentally friendly electricity to rural areas .
the construction of major dams , such as in china , are looked upon less favorably these days , partly due to their environmental impact .
however , not all international investors are willing to adhere to the guidelines formulated by the world conservation union and the world bank , konukiewitz said . berlin 's push to promote renewable energies is also not likely to please everyone in africa .

from flensburg to frankfurt and from kassel to kiel , around 2,500 markets set up shop each year . they may be fun and festive , but the markets also mean big bucks .

only around half of the visitors live near the market itself , while nearly 49 percent travel to their favorite christmas market destination . nuremberg 's christkindlesmarkt and the striezelmarkt in dresden are among the best known and most traditional of the markets , while those located at centuries-old castles like wartburg in eisenach or glücksburger schloss on the baltic sea offer a more medieval flair . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hottest christmas market filled with the smell of ginger bread and mulled wine , german christmas markets are known for their cozy atmosphere .

seven minutes later at the other end , miroslav klose saw his shot from six meters brilliantly blocked by wolfsburg goalkeeper simon jentzsch . klose also had a weak shot saved by jentzsch before daniel jensen scored with an overhead kick in the 17th minute after wolfsburg failed to clear their lines . bremen had a great chance to go further in front on 34 minutes when awarded a penalty after diego was adjudged to have been fouled in the area but the midfielder fired the resultant spot kick against the foot of the post and wide . wolfsburg made bremen pay four minutes before the break when isaac boakye lobbed a shot over wiese from eight meters . naldo nearly restored bremen 's lead in the 68th minute but jentzsch parried the brazilian 's fierce free kick .
however , jentzsch was rooted to the spot in the 86th minute when naldo fired in an unstoppable shot from another well-worked free kick from the edge of the area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's nuri sahin -lrb- left -rrb- and leverkusen 's andrej voronin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium , bayer leverkusen meanwhile totally outclassed the home side and were fully deserving of their 2-1 win .
andrey voronin put the visitors in front on 24 minutes before substitute stefan kiessling made it 2-1 with a fine counter-attacking goal with 14 minutes remaining . martin amedick pulled one back for dortmund in the 85th minute but it turned out to be too little too late . dortmund 's defeat will increase the pressure on coach bert van marwijk to leave during the winter break rather than at the end of the season as he has already announced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach jürgen klopp will have a lot of cheerleading to do in 2007 mainz will spend christmas in last place with 11 points after the loss to munich , two points shy of hamburg and four points behind borussia mönchengladbach . mönchengladbach lost 2-0 at vfl bochum on friday while hamburg drew 3-3 with alemannia aachen despite leading 3-1 .

german dubbers as hollywood 's unsung heros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german , bogart says " look into my eyes , babe " rather than " here 's lookin ' at you , kid " in german , julia roberts is a different kind of sexy .
her " pretty woman " character 's lines are translated , just like in other hollywood films .
ever since world war ii , germans have had a love affair with dubbing films . dubbing means that every word of script in a movie is re-written and recorded in a foreign language .
the method is also known as " synchronization " because the new dialogue is supposed to sync up with the original actor 's mouth . german actors get linked to a hollywood star for the duration of that star 's career .
christian brückner , for instance , is a household name .
that 's because he is the german " voice " for robert de niro .
he also voice-acts parts played by warren beatty , harvey keitel , dennis hopper and marlon brando . other voice actors , however , are unsung heroes .
you would likely not recognize them on the street because they work behind the scenes . " dub city " berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " robert de niro " : voice christian brückner germany 's dubbing heartland is berlin , where recording companies vie to synchronize everything from tv commercials and sitcoms to the latest hollywood blockbuster . casting agent thomas fremd , sitting at his desk behind a vast pile of recording schedules with highlighted names , knows how to match voices with faces . " we have 30 dubbing companies in berlin and all of them use the same actors so it 's important to catch the right ones at the right time , " fremd said . a good actor , fremd believes , can see a character played one time by a star and immediately interpret him or her for a german audience . shattered illusions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice actors rarely get the red-carpet treatment in berlin but just how far does one go when matching voice to face ?
are all those screen sirens and hollywood hunks just as sexy in their german counterparts ?
or as similar in other ways to the original actor ? likeness is relative , especially if you consider that there are no black dubbing actors in germany , so big stars like denzel washington , halle berry and morgan freeman are all played by white voice actors . rainer raschevski has been in the business for 16 years and runs a big studio in berlin called media factory .
when he was starting out as a young sound engineer all those years ago , he was shocked to see the famous actors unmasked .
" the first day i came into the company restaurant , i heard the german ' john wayne ' order a beer behind me , " raschevski said .
" i was impressed until i turned around to see the guy and he looked completely different than the original .
it 's kind of said for the voice actors .
no one knows that they do one hell of a job . " acting pains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does color matter ?
halle berry 's german counterpart is a white woman dubbing actors have to speak at exactly the same time as their screen persona .
if they end just a second too late , the scene has to be recorded again . and , not only are they lip-syncing the german lines , they also have to mimic the inflections of the original actor . yet despite versatility in acting and portraying a range of emotions , one of the biggest complaints about dubbing is that is like a cultural homogeniser - a kind of machine where the world 's rich cultural vibrancy goes in one end and a world in which everyone speaks perfect german comes out the other . for hollywood films , script adaptor alexander löwe said that to convey the original meaning in a film , it is vital to have a rich understanding of both the english language and american culture . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia roberts is charming even in german but then there are always cultural traps , like translating hip hop lingo such " fo ' shizzle my nizzle -lrb- some say it means " for sure , my nigger " -rrb- or conveying a joke that relies on a pun . one case in particular is the movie " terminal , " starring tom hanks , about a man - " viktor navorski " - who is supposedly from a former russian state and is forced to live in an american airport because he doesn ’ t have a valid passport . viktor has a very strong accent in the film and during one scene , he is trying to explain to a young man that some woman is being cheated on by her husband .
he says " he cheat , he cheat , he cheat . " the young guy , because he only understands spanish and some crude english , understands " eat shit , eat shit , eat shit . " as löwe points out , " you just ca n't get that funny misunderstanding across .
you ca n't translate that . " a picture says a thousand words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faceless , german dubbing actors would never make tinseltown in addition to things getting lost in translation , another source of dubbing frustration for viewers is watching faces that move out of sync with the voices they hear . because in german it usually takes more words to say something than in english , the adaptors have to come up with a german sentence as short as in english , without losing the meaning , and which roughly matches up with the on-screen actor 's mouth . yet even if the synchronization is off-track , it is still a minor complaint compared to a poor translation . one of the most famous mistakes is in the classic hollywood film " casablanca . "
in the original , humphrey bogart 's character says to love interest ingrid bergman " here 's looking at you , kid ... "
but in the german version , he says " look into my eyes , babe ... "
-lrb- schau ' mir in die augen , kleines . -rrb-
a mistake like that would never happen again , löwe said , since us supervisors come to germany to make sure the translations are correct as the films are being synchronized . " once they realized that ' acid head ' in the movie ' apocalypse now " had been translated literally , " löwe said .
" the translator used the german words for ' acid ' and ' head ' - he did n't have a clue that the name meant an lsd junkie . " so , to avoid really horrible translation blunders like " look into my trippin ' out eyes , acid babe " or " i concur whole-heartedly , my african-american brother " -lrb- as the " urban dictionary " says for " fo ' shizzle my nizzle " -rrb- , better watch it in the original . zoie jones / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips : a world cup mystery unfolds forget about law or medicine .

german dubbers as hollywood 's unsung heros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german , bogart says " look into my eyes , babe " rather than " here 's lookin ' at you , kid " in german , julia roberts is a different kind of sexy .
her " pretty woman " character 's lines are translated , just like in other hollywood films .
ever since world war ii , germans have had a love affair with dubbing films . dubbing means that every word of script in a movie is re-written and recorded in a foreign language .
the method is also known as " synchronization " because the new dialogue is supposed to sync up with the original actor 's mouth . german actors get linked to a hollywood star for the duration of that star 's career .
christian brückner , for instance , is a household name .
that 's because he is the german " voice " for robert de niro .
he also voice-acts parts played by warren beatty , harvey keitel , dennis hopper and marlon brando . other voice actors , however , are unsung heroes .
you would likely not recognize them on the street because they work behind the scenes . " dub city " berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " robert de niro " : voice christian brückner germany 's dubbing heartland is berlin , where recording companies vie to synchronize everything from tv commercials and sitcoms to the latest hollywood blockbuster . casting agent thomas fremd , sitting at his desk behind a vast pile of recording schedules with highlighted names , knows how to match voices with faces . " we have 30 dubbing companies in berlin and all of them use the same actors so it 's important to catch the right ones at the right time , " fremd said . a good actor , fremd believes , can see a character played one time by a star and immediately interpret him or her for a german audience . shattered illusions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice actors rarely get the red-carpet treatment in berlin but just how far does one go when matching voice to face ?
are all those screen sirens and hollywood hunks just as sexy in their german counterparts ?
or as similar in other ways to the original actor ? likeness is relative , especially if you consider that there are no black dubbing actors in germany , so big stars like denzel washington , halle berry and morgan freeman are all played by white voice actors . rainer raschevski has been in the business for 16 years and runs a big studio in berlin called media factory .
when he was starting out as a young sound engineer all those years ago , he was shocked to see the famous actors unmasked .
" the first day i came into the company restaurant , i heard the german ' john wayne ' order a beer behind me , " raschevski said .
" i was impressed until i turned around to see the guy and he looked completely different than the original .
it 's kind of said for the voice actors .
no one knows that they do one hell of a job . " acting pains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does color matter ?
halle berry 's german counterpart is a white woman dubbing actors have to speak at exactly the same time as their screen persona .
if they end just a second too late , the scene has to be recorded again . and , not only are they lip-syncing the german lines , they also have to mimic the inflections of the original actor . yet despite versatility in acting and portraying a range of emotions , one of the biggest complaints about dubbing is that is like a cultural homogeniser - a kind of machine where the world 's rich cultural vibrancy goes in one end and a world in which everyone speaks perfect german comes out the other . for hollywood films , script adaptor alexander löwe said that to convey the original meaning in a film , it is vital to have a rich understanding of both the english language and american culture . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia roberts is charming even in german but then there are always cultural traps , like translating hip hop lingo such " fo ' shizzle my nizzle -lrb- some say it means " for sure , my nigger " -rrb- or conveying a joke that relies on a pun . one case in particular is the movie " terminal , " starring tom hanks , about a man - " viktor navorski " - who is supposedly from a former russian state and is forced to live in an american airport because he doesn ’ t have a valid passport . viktor has a very strong accent in the film and during one scene , he is trying to explain to a young man that some woman is being cheated on by her husband .
he says " he cheat , he cheat , he cheat . " the young guy , because he only understands spanish and some crude english , understands " eat shit , eat shit , eat shit . " as löwe points out , " you just ca n't get that funny misunderstanding across .
you ca n't translate that . " a picture says a thousand words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faceless , german dubbing actors would never make tinseltown in addition to things getting lost in translation , another source of dubbing frustration for viewers is watching faces that move out of sync with the voices they hear . because in german it usually takes more words to say something than in english , the adaptors have to come up with a german sentence as short as in english , without losing the meaning , and which roughly matches up with the on-screen actor 's mouth . yet even if the synchronization is off-track , it is still a minor complaint compared to a poor translation . one of the most famous mistakes is in the classic hollywood film " casablanca . "
in the original , humphrey bogart 's character says to love interest ingrid bergman " here 's looking at you , kid ... "
but in the german version , he says " look into my eyes , babe ... "

seven minutes later at the other end , miroslav klose saw his shot from six meters brilliantly blocked by wolfsburg goalkeeper simon jentzsch . klose also had a weak shot saved by jentzsch before daniel jensen scored with an overhead kick in the 17th minute after wolfsburg failed to clear their lines . bremen had a great chance to go further in front on 34 minutes when awarded a penalty after diego was adjudged to have been fouled in the area but the midfielder fired the resultant spot kick against the foot of the post and wide . wolfsburg made bremen pay four minutes before the break when isaac boakye lobbed a shot over wiese from eight meters . naldo nearly restored bremen 's lead in the 68th minute but jentzsch parried the brazilian 's fierce free kick .
however , jentzsch was rooted to the spot in the 86th minute when naldo fired in an unstoppable shot from another well-worked free kick from the edge of the area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's nuri sahin -lrb- left -rrb- and leverkusen 's andrej voronin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium , bayer leverkusen meanwhile totally outclassed the home side and were fully deserving of their 2-1 win .

the government hopes to use its eu presidency to make advances in this area . germany has already vowed to make energy a top priority when it takes over the eu presidency next month .
one of its aims is to examine africa 's particular problems in this area .
with some 535 million people across the continent currently without access to electricity , government development experts say better provision is the key to tackling poverty . high gas , oil and electricity prices are curbing growth in many african states that do n't have natural resources that provide energy .
this extra financial burden is using up funds that are desperately needed for other , more pressing purposes .
the rise in the cost of crude oil imports now almost outweighs the entire international aid budget . in african oil-producing countries , such as nigeria , the picture is a little different .
not only are their exports worth more , production here is also on the rise .
in west africa alone , it increased by 36 percent over the last 10 years .
however , corruption and poor government often mean profits are frequently not used to aid social and economic development . european energy strategy europe 's energy strategy is not sufficiently tied to its aid and development policies , said manfred konukiewitz , a senior official in the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could help africa to make sure revenues from natural resources benefit society " we should not merely view african countries as warehouses for crude oil or gas , or other resources , we should also make these african partners an offer about how to use and develop their own resources in the best possible way for the development of their countries , " konukiewitz said . europe could help promote transparency in african oil-producing states by copying models such as that adopted by the world bank in chad for the construction of the chad-cameroon pipeline , he said .
there the government agreed to earmark part of the extra revenue that would be generated by the pipeline for development purposes as part of the investment deal . promoting renewable energy the german government also wants to promote renewable energies in africa .
ninety percent of people there use traditional biomass to produce energy , usually by burning charcoal and wood .
however , more efficient renewable technologies , such as solar , geothermal , wind and hydroelectric power are also in operation .
the room for expansion is great , according to experts . # b # hydroelectric power provides 96 percent of electricity in 11 african countries .
small decentralized power plants can provide cheap , environmentally friendly electricity to rural areas .
the construction of major dams , such as in china , are looked upon less favorably these days , partly due to their environmental impact .
however , not all international investors are willing to adhere to the guidelines formulated by the world conservation union and the world bank , konukiewitz said . berlin 's push to promote renewable energies is also not likely to please everyone in africa .
but konukiewitz said the general trend was positive .
" one african energy minister told me : our people want the white man 's energy , and she meant the electricity from the socket where the energy has come from a traditional power plant .
i think this view is slowly changing in africa . " dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german eu presidency germany will take over the rotating eu presidency on jan .

german dubbers as hollywood 's unsung heros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german , bogart says " look into my eyes , babe " rather than " here 's lookin ' at you , kid " in german , julia roberts is a different kind of sexy .
her " pretty woman " character 's lines are translated , just like in other hollywood films .
ever since world war ii , germans have had a love affair with dubbing films . dubbing means that every word of script in a movie is re-written and recorded in a foreign language .
the method is also known as " synchronization " because the new dialogue is supposed to sync up with the original actor 's mouth . german actors get linked to a hollywood star for the duration of that star 's career .
christian brückner , for instance , is a household name .
that 's because he is the german " voice " for robert de niro .
he also voice-acts parts played by warren beatty , harvey keitel , dennis hopper and marlon brando . other voice actors , however , are unsung heroes .
you would likely not recognize them on the street because they work behind the scenes . " dub city " berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " robert de niro " : voice christian brückner germany 's dubbing heartland is berlin , where recording companies vie to synchronize everything from tv commercials and sitcoms to the latest hollywood blockbuster . casting agent thomas fremd , sitting at his desk behind a vast pile of recording schedules with highlighted names , knows how to match voices with faces . " we have 30 dubbing companies in berlin and all of them use the same actors so it 's important to catch the right ones at the right time , " fremd said . a good actor , fremd believes , can see a character played one time by a star and immediately interpret him or her for a german audience . shattered illusions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice actors rarely get the red-carpet treatment in berlin but just how far does one go when matching voice to face ?
are all those screen sirens and hollywood hunks just as sexy in their german counterparts ?
or as similar in other ways to the original actor ? likeness is relative , especially if you consider that there are no black dubbing actors in germany , so big stars like denzel washington , halle berry and morgan freeman are all played by white voice actors . rainer raschevski has been in the business for 16 years and runs a big studio in berlin called media factory .
when he was starting out as a young sound engineer all those years ago , he was shocked to see the famous actors unmasked .
" the first day i came into the company restaurant , i heard the german ' john wayne ' order a beer behind me , " raschevski said .
" i was impressed until i turned around to see the guy and he looked completely different than the original .
it 's kind of said for the voice actors .
no one knows that they do one hell of a job . " acting pains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does color matter ?
halle berry 's german counterpart is a white woman dubbing actors have to speak at exactly the same time as their screen persona .
if they end just a second too late , the scene has to be recorded again . and , not only are they lip-syncing the german lines , they also have to mimic the inflections of the original actor . yet despite versatility in acting and portraying a range of emotions , one of the biggest complaints about dubbing is that is like a cultural homogeniser - a kind of machine where the world 's rich cultural vibrancy goes in one end and a world in which everyone speaks perfect german comes out the other . for hollywood films , script adaptor alexander löwe said that to convey the original meaning in a film , it is vital to have a rich understanding of both the english language and american culture . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia roberts is charming even in german but then there are always cultural traps , like translating hip hop lingo such " fo ' shizzle my nizzle -lrb- some say it means " for sure , my nigger " -rrb- or conveying a joke that relies on a pun . one case in particular is the movie " terminal , " starring tom hanks , about a man - " viktor navorski " - who is supposedly from a former russian state and is forced to live in an american airport because he doesn ’ t have a valid passport . viktor has a very strong accent in the film and during one scene , he is trying to explain to a young man that some woman is being cheated on by her husband .
he says " he cheat , he cheat , he cheat . " the young guy , because he only understands spanish and some crude english , understands " eat shit , eat shit , eat shit . " as löwe points out , " you just ca n't get that funny misunderstanding across .
you ca n't translate that . " a picture says a thousand words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faceless , german dubbing actors would never make tinseltown in addition to things getting lost in translation , another source of dubbing frustration for viewers is watching faces that move out of sync with the voices they hear . because in german it usually takes more words to say something than in english , the adaptors have to come up with a german sentence as short as in english , without losing the meaning , and which roughly matches up with the on-screen actor 's mouth . yet even if the synchronization is off-track , it is still a minor complaint compared to a poor translation . one of the most famous mistakes is in the classic hollywood film " casablanca . "
in the original , humphrey bogart 's character says to love interest ingrid bergman " here 's looking at you , kid ... "
but in the german version , he says " look into my eyes , babe ... "
-lrb- schau ' mir in die augen , kleines . -rrb-
a mistake like that would never happen again , löwe said , since us supervisors come to germany to make sure the translations are correct as the films are being synchronized . " once they realized that ' acid head ' in the movie ' apocalypse now " had been translated literally , " löwe said .
" the translator used the german words for ' acid ' and ' head ' - he did n't have a clue that the name meant an lsd junkie . " so , to avoid really horrible translation blunders like " look into my trippin ' out eyes , acid babe " or " i concur whole-heartedly , my african-american brother " -lrb- as the " urban dictionary " says for " fo ' shizzle my nizzle " -rrb- , better watch it in the original . zoie jones / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips : a world cup mystery unfolds forget about law or medicine .

one of its aims is to examine africa 's particular problems in this area .
with some 535 million people across the continent currently without access to electricity , government development experts say better provision is the key to tackling poverty . high gas , oil and electricity prices are curbing growth in many african states that do n't have natural resources that provide energy .
this extra financial burden is using up funds that are desperately needed for other , more pressing purposes .

the government hopes to use its eu presidency to make advances in this area . germany has already vowed to make energy a top priority when it takes over the eu presidency next month .
one of its aims is to examine africa 's particular problems in this area .
with some 535 million people across the continent currently without access to electricity , government development experts say better provision is the key to tackling poverty . high gas , oil and electricity prices are curbing growth in many african states that do n't have natural resources that provide energy .
this extra financial burden is using up funds that are desperately needed for other , more pressing purposes .
the rise in the cost of crude oil imports now almost outweighs the entire international aid budget . in african oil-producing countries , such as nigeria , the picture is a little different .
not only are their exports worth more , production here is also on the rise .
in west africa alone , it increased by 36 percent over the last 10 years .
however , corruption and poor government often mean profits are frequently not used to aid social and economic development . european energy strategy europe 's energy strategy is not sufficiently tied to its aid and development policies , said manfred konukiewitz , a senior official in the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could help africa to make sure revenues from natural resources benefit society " we should not merely view african countries as warehouses for crude oil or gas , or other resources , we should also make these african partners an offer about how to use and develop their own resources in the best possible way for the development of their countries , " konukiewitz said . europe could help promote transparency in african oil-producing states by copying models such as that adopted by the world bank in chad for the construction of the chad-cameroon pipeline , he said .
there the government agreed to earmark part of the extra revenue that would be generated by the pipeline for development purposes as part of the investment deal . promoting renewable energy the german government also wants to promote renewable energies in africa .
ninety percent of people there use traditional biomass to produce energy , usually by burning charcoal and wood .
however , more efficient renewable technologies , such as solar , geothermal , wind and hydroelectric power are also in operation .
the room for expansion is great , according to experts . # b # hydroelectric power provides 96 percent of electricity in 11 african countries .
small decentralized power plants can provide cheap , environmentally friendly electricity to rural areas .
the construction of major dams , such as in china , are looked upon less favorably these days , partly due to their environmental impact .
however , not all international investors are willing to adhere to the guidelines formulated by the world conservation union and the world bank , konukiewitz said . berlin 's push to promote renewable energies is also not likely to please everyone in africa .

the government hopes to use its eu presidency to make advances in this area . germany has already vowed to make energy a top priority when it takes over the eu presidency next month .
one of its aims is to examine africa 's particular problems in this area .
with some 535 million people across the continent currently without access to electricity , government development experts say better provision is the key to tackling poverty . high gas , oil and electricity prices are curbing growth in many african states that do n't have natural resources that provide energy .
this extra financial burden is using up funds that are desperately needed for other , more pressing purposes .
the rise in the cost of crude oil imports now almost outweighs the entire international aid budget . in african oil-producing countries , such as nigeria , the picture is a little different .
not only are their exports worth more , production here is also on the rise .
in west africa alone , it increased by 36 percent over the last 10 years .
however , corruption and poor government often mean profits are frequently not used to aid social and economic development . european energy strategy europe 's energy strategy is not sufficiently tied to its aid and development policies , said manfred konukiewitz , a senior official in the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could help africa to make sure revenues from natural resources benefit society " we should not merely view african countries as warehouses for crude oil or gas , or other resources , we should also make these african partners an offer about how to use and develop their own resources in the best possible way for the development of their countries , " konukiewitz said . europe could help promote transparency in african oil-producing states by copying models such as that adopted by the world bank in chad for the construction of the chad-cameroon pipeline , he said .
there the government agreed to earmark part of the extra revenue that would be generated by the pipeline for development purposes as part of the investment deal . promoting renewable energy the german government also wants to promote renewable energies in africa .
ninety percent of people there use traditional biomass to produce energy , usually by burning charcoal and wood .
however , more efficient renewable technologies , such as solar , geothermal , wind and hydroelectric power are also in operation .
the room for expansion is great , according to experts . # b # hydroelectric power provides 96 percent of electricity in 11 african countries .
small decentralized power plants can provide cheap , environmentally friendly electricity to rural areas .
the construction of major dams , such as in china , are looked upon less favorably these days , partly due to their environmental impact .
however , not all international investors are willing to adhere to the guidelines formulated by the world conservation union and the world bank , konukiewitz said . berlin 's push to promote renewable energies is also not likely to please everyone in africa .
but konukiewitz said the general trend was positive .

german dubbers as hollywood 's unsung heros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german , bogart says " look into my eyes , babe " rather than " here 's lookin ' at you , kid " in german , julia roberts is a different kind of sexy .
her " pretty woman " character 's lines are translated , just like in other hollywood films .
ever since world war ii , germans have had a love affair with dubbing films . dubbing means that every word of script in a movie is re-written and recorded in a foreign language .
the method is also known as " synchronization " because the new dialogue is supposed to sync up with the original actor 's mouth . german actors get linked to a hollywood star for the duration of that star 's career .
christian brückner , for instance , is a household name .
that 's because he is the german " voice " for robert de niro .
he also voice-acts parts played by warren beatty , harvey keitel , dennis hopper and marlon brando . other voice actors , however , are unsung heroes .
you would likely not recognize them on the street because they work behind the scenes . " dub city " berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " robert de niro " : voice christian brückner germany 's dubbing heartland is berlin , where recording companies vie to synchronize everything from tv commercials and sitcoms to the latest hollywood blockbuster . casting agent thomas fremd , sitting at his desk behind a vast pile of recording schedules with highlighted names , knows how to match voices with faces . " we have 30 dubbing companies in berlin and all of them use the same actors so it 's important to catch the right ones at the right time , " fremd said . a good actor , fremd believes , can see a character played one time by a star and immediately interpret him or her for a german audience . shattered illusions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice actors rarely get the red-carpet treatment in berlin but just how far does one go when matching voice to face ?
are all those screen sirens and hollywood hunks just as sexy in their german counterparts ?
or as similar in other ways to the original actor ? likeness is relative , especially if you consider that there are no black dubbing actors in germany , so big stars like denzel washington , halle berry and morgan freeman are all played by white voice actors . rainer raschevski has been in the business for 16 years and runs a big studio in berlin called media factory .
when he was starting out as a young sound engineer all those years ago , he was shocked to see the famous actors unmasked .
" the first day i came into the company restaurant , i heard the german ' john wayne ' order a beer behind me , " raschevski said .
" i was impressed until i turned around to see the guy and he looked completely different than the original .
it 's kind of said for the voice actors .
no one knows that they do one hell of a job . " acting pains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does color matter ?
halle berry 's german counterpart is a white woman dubbing actors have to speak at exactly the same time as their screen persona .
if they end just a second too late , the scene has to be recorded again . and , not only are they lip-syncing the german lines , they also have to mimic the inflections of the original actor . yet despite versatility in acting and portraying a range of emotions , one of the biggest complaints about dubbing is that is like a cultural homogeniser - a kind of machine where the world 's rich cultural vibrancy goes in one end and a world in which everyone speaks perfect german comes out the other . for hollywood films , script adaptor alexander löwe said that to convey the original meaning in a film , it is vital to have a rich understanding of both the english language and american culture . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia roberts is charming even in german but then there are always cultural traps , like translating hip hop lingo such " fo ' shizzle my nizzle -lrb- some say it means " for sure , my nigger " -rrb- or conveying a joke that relies on a pun . one case in particular is the movie " terminal , " starring tom hanks , about a man - " viktor navorski " - who is supposedly from a former russian state and is forced to live in an american airport because he doesn ’ t have a valid passport . viktor has a very strong accent in the film and during one scene , he is trying to explain to a young man that some woman is being cheated on by her husband .
he says " he cheat , he cheat , he cheat . " the young guy , because he only understands spanish and some crude english , understands " eat shit , eat shit , eat shit . " as löwe points out , " you just ca n't get that funny misunderstanding across .
you ca n't translate that . " a picture says a thousand words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faceless , german dubbing actors would never make tinseltown in addition to things getting lost in translation , another source of dubbing frustration for viewers is watching faces that move out of sync with the voices they hear . because in german it usually takes more words to say something than in english , the adaptors have to come up with a german sentence as short as in english , without losing the meaning , and which roughly matches up with the on-screen actor 's mouth . yet even if the synchronization is off-track , it is still a minor complaint compared to a poor translation . one of the most famous mistakes is in the classic hollywood film " casablanca . "
in the original , humphrey bogart 's character says to love interest ingrid bergman " here 's looking at you , kid ... "
but in the german version , he says " look into my eyes , babe ... "
-lrb- schau ' mir in die augen , kleines . -rrb-
a mistake like that would never happen again , löwe said , since us supervisors come to germany to make sure the translations are correct as the films are being synchronized . " once they realized that ' acid head ' in the movie ' apocalypse now " had been translated literally , " löwe said .
" the translator used the german words for ' acid ' and ' head ' - he did n't have a clue that the name meant an lsd junkie . " so , to avoid really horrible translation blunders like " look into my trippin ' out eyes , acid babe " or " i concur whole-heartedly , my african-american brother " -lrb- as the " urban dictionary " says for " fo ' shizzle my nizzle " -rrb- , better watch it in the original . zoie jones / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips : a world cup mystery unfolds forget about law or medicine .

the government hopes to use its eu presidency to make advances in this area . germany has already vowed to make energy a top priority when it takes over the eu presidency next month .
one of its aims is to examine africa 's particular problems in this area .
with some 535 million people across the continent currently without access to electricity , government development experts say better provision is the key to tackling poverty . high gas , oil and electricity prices are curbing growth in many african states that do n't have natural resources that provide energy .
this extra financial burden is using up funds that are desperately needed for other , more pressing purposes .
the rise in the cost of crude oil imports now almost outweighs the entire international aid budget . in african oil-producing countries , such as nigeria , the picture is a little different .
not only are their exports worth more , production here is also on the rise .
in west africa alone , it increased by 36 percent over the last 10 years .
however , corruption and poor government often mean profits are frequently not used to aid social and economic development . european energy strategy europe 's energy strategy is not sufficiently tied to its aid and development policies , said manfred konukiewitz , a senior official in the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could help africa to make sure revenues from natural resources benefit society " we should not merely view african countries as warehouses for crude oil or gas , or other resources , we should also make these african partners an offer about how to use and develop their own resources in the best possible way for the development of their countries , " konukiewitz said . europe could help promote transparency in african oil-producing states by copying models such as that adopted by the world bank in chad for the construction of the chad-cameroon pipeline , he said .
there the government agreed to earmark part of the extra revenue that would be generated by the pipeline for development purposes as part of the investment deal . promoting renewable energy the german government also wants to promote renewable energies in africa .
ninety percent of people there use traditional biomass to produce energy , usually by burning charcoal and wood .
however , more efficient renewable technologies , such as solar , geothermal , wind and hydroelectric power are also in operation .
the room for expansion is great , according to experts . # b # hydroelectric power provides 96 percent of electricity in 11 african countries .
small decentralized power plants can provide cheap , environmentally friendly electricity to rural areas .
the construction of major dams , such as in china , are looked upon less favorably these days , partly due to their environmental impact .
however , not all international investors are willing to adhere to the guidelines formulated by the world conservation union and the world bank , konukiewitz said . berlin 's push to promote renewable energies is also not likely to please everyone in africa .
but konukiewitz said the general trend was positive .
" one african energy minister told me : our people want the white man 's energy , and she meant the electricity from the socket where the energy has come from a traditional power plant .
i think this view is slowly changing in africa . " dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german eu presidency germany will take over the rotating eu presidency on jan .

german dubbers as hollywood 's unsung heros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german , bogart says " look into my eyes , babe " rather than " here 's lookin ' at you , kid " in german , julia roberts is a different kind of sexy .
her " pretty woman " character 's lines are translated , just like in other hollywood films .
ever since world war ii , germans have had a love affair with dubbing films . dubbing means that every word of script in a movie is re-written and recorded in a foreign language .
the method is also known as " synchronization " because the new dialogue is supposed to sync up with the original actor 's mouth . german actors get linked to a hollywood star for the duration of that star 's career .
christian brückner , for instance , is a household name .
that 's because he is the german " voice " for robert de niro .
he also voice-acts parts played by warren beatty , harvey keitel , dennis hopper and marlon brando . other voice actors , however , are unsung heroes .
you would likely not recognize them on the street because they work behind the scenes . " dub city " berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " robert de niro " : voice christian brückner germany 's dubbing heartland is berlin , where recording companies vie to synchronize everything from tv commercials and sitcoms to the latest hollywood blockbuster . casting agent thomas fremd , sitting at his desk behind a vast pile of recording schedules with highlighted names , knows how to match voices with faces . " we have 30 dubbing companies in berlin and all of them use the same actors so it 's important to catch the right ones at the right time , " fremd said . a good actor , fremd believes , can see a character played one time by a star and immediately interpret him or her for a german audience . shattered illusions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice actors rarely get the red-carpet treatment in berlin but just how far does one go when matching voice to face ?
are all those screen sirens and hollywood hunks just as sexy in their german counterparts ?
or as similar in other ways to the original actor ? likeness is relative , especially if you consider that there are no black dubbing actors in germany , so big stars like denzel washington , halle berry and morgan freeman are all played by white voice actors . rainer raschevski has been in the business for 16 years and runs a big studio in berlin called media factory .
when he was starting out as a young sound engineer all those years ago , he was shocked to see the famous actors unmasked .
" the first day i came into the company restaurant , i heard the german ' john wayne ' order a beer behind me , " raschevski said .
" i was impressed until i turned around to see the guy and he looked completely different than the original .
it 's kind of said for the voice actors .
no one knows that they do one hell of a job . " acting pains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does color matter ?
halle berry 's german counterpart is a white woman dubbing actors have to speak at exactly the same time as their screen persona .
if they end just a second too late , the scene has to be recorded again . and , not only are they lip-syncing the german lines , they also have to mimic the inflections of the original actor . yet despite versatility in acting and portraying a range of emotions , one of the biggest complaints about dubbing is that is like a cultural homogeniser - a kind of machine where the world 's rich cultural vibrancy goes in one end and a world in which everyone speaks perfect german comes out the other . for hollywood films , script adaptor alexander löwe said that to convey the original meaning in a film , it is vital to have a rich understanding of both the english language and american culture . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia roberts is charming even in german but then there are always cultural traps , like translating hip hop lingo such " fo ' shizzle my nizzle -lrb- some say it means " for sure , my nigger " -rrb- or conveying a joke that relies on a pun . one case in particular is the movie " terminal , " starring tom hanks , about a man - " viktor navorski " - who is supposedly from a former russian state and is forced to live in an american airport because he doesn ’ t have a valid passport . viktor has a very strong accent in the film and during one scene , he is trying to explain to a young man that some woman is being cheated on by her husband .
he says " he cheat , he cheat , he cheat . " the young guy , because he only understands spanish and some crude english , understands " eat shit , eat shit , eat shit . " as löwe points out , " you just ca n't get that funny misunderstanding across .
you ca n't translate that . " a picture says a thousand words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faceless , german dubbing actors would never make tinseltown in addition to things getting lost in translation , another source of dubbing frustration for viewers is watching faces that move out of sync with the voices they hear . because in german it usually takes more words to say something than in english , the adaptors have to come up with a german sentence as short as in english , without losing the meaning , and which roughly matches up with the on-screen actor 's mouth . yet even if the synchronization is off-track , it is still a minor complaint compared to a poor translation . one of the most famous mistakes is in the classic hollywood film " casablanca . "
in the original , humphrey bogart 's character says to love interest ingrid bergman " here 's looking at you , kid ... "
but in the german version , he says " look into my eyes , babe ... "
-lrb- schau ' mir in die augen , kleines . -rrb-
a mistake like that would never happen again , löwe said , since us supervisors come to germany to make sure the translations are correct as the films are being synchronized . " once they realized that ' acid head ' in the movie ' apocalypse now " had been translated literally , " löwe said .
" the translator used the german words for ' acid ' and ' head ' - he did n't have a clue that the name meant an lsd junkie . " so , to avoid really horrible translation blunders like " look into my trippin ' out eyes , acid babe " or " i concur whole-heartedly , my african-american brother " -lrb- as the " urban dictionary " says for " fo ' shizzle my nizzle " -rrb- , better watch it in the original . zoie jones / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips : a world cup mystery unfolds forget about law or medicine .

he says " he cheat , he cheat , he cheat . " the young guy , because he only understands spanish and some crude english , understands " eat shit , eat shit , eat shit . " as löwe points out , " you just ca n't get that funny misunderstanding across .
you ca n't translate that . " a picture says a thousand words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faceless , german dubbing actors would never make tinseltown in addition to things getting lost in translation , another source of dubbing frustration for viewers is watching faces that move out of sync with the voices they hear . because in german it usually takes more words to say something than in english , the adaptors have to come up with a german sentence as short as in english , without losing the meaning , and which roughly matches up with the on-screen actor 's mouth . yet even if the synchronization is off-track , it is still a minor complaint compared to a poor translation . one of the most famous mistakes is in the classic hollywood film " casablanca . "
in the original , humphrey bogart 's character says to love interest ingrid bergman " here 's looking at you , kid ... "
but in the german version , he says " look into my eyes , babe ... "
-lrb- schau ' mir in die augen , kleines . -rrb-
a mistake like that would never happen again , löwe said , since us supervisors come to germany to make sure the translations are correct as the films are being synchronized . " once they realized that ' acid head ' in the movie ' apocalypse now " had been translated literally , " löwe said .
" the translator used the german words for ' acid ' and ' head ' - he did n't have a clue that the name meant an lsd junkie . " so , to avoid really horrible translation blunders like " look into my trippin ' out eyes , acid babe " or " i concur whole-heartedly , my african-american brother " -lrb- as the " urban dictionary " says for " fo ' shizzle my nizzle " -rrb- , better watch it in the original . zoie jones / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips : a world cup mystery unfolds forget about law or medicine .

" while others wonder what the christmas market stand owners do the rest of the year .
but the tasty treats and trinkets are pulling in more cash than you might expect . for many germans , visiting the christmas market is a highlight of the advent season .
from flensburg to frankfurt and from kassel to kiel , around 2,500 markets set up shop each year . they may be fun and festive , but the markets also mean big bucks .
it is estimated that each of the 160 million visitors spend an average of 31.14 euros -lrb- $ 41.29 -rrb- a piece on spiced wine , candied almonds , roasted chestnuts and small gifts during the approximately four-week-long season . that adds up to a total of 4.85 billion euros spent at the markets , reported the german center for tourism -lrb- dzt -rrb- this week . germans are apparently not the only ones who enjoy the weihnachtsmarkt experience .
only around half of the visitors live near the market itself , while nearly 49 percent travel to their favorite christmas market destination . nuremberg 's christkindlesmarkt and the striezelmarkt in dresden are among the best known and most traditional of the markets , while those located at centuries-old castles like wartburg in eisenach or glücksburger schloss on the baltic sea offer a more medieval flair . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's hottest christmas market filled with the smell of ginger bread and mulled wine , german christmas markets are known for their cozy atmosphere .

german dubbers as hollywood 's unsung heros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german , bogart says " look into my eyes , babe " rather than " here 's lookin ' at you , kid " in german , julia roberts is a different kind of sexy .
her " pretty woman " character 's lines are translated , just like in other hollywood films .
ever since world war ii , germans have had a love affair with dubbing films . dubbing means that every word of script in a movie is re-written and recorded in a foreign language .
the method is also known as " synchronization " because the new dialogue is supposed to sync up with the original actor 's mouth . german actors get linked to a hollywood star for the duration of that star 's career .
christian brückner , for instance , is a household name .
that 's because he is the german " voice " for robert de niro .
he also voice-acts parts played by warren beatty , harvey keitel , dennis hopper and marlon brando . other voice actors , however , are unsung heroes .
you would likely not recognize them on the street because they work behind the scenes . " dub city " berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " robert de niro " : voice christian brückner germany 's dubbing heartland is berlin , where recording companies vie to synchronize everything from tv commercials and sitcoms to the latest hollywood blockbuster . casting agent thomas fremd , sitting at his desk behind a vast pile of recording schedules with highlighted names , knows how to match voices with faces . " we have 30 dubbing companies in berlin and all of them use the same actors so it 's important to catch the right ones at the right time , " fremd said . a good actor , fremd believes , can see a character played one time by a star and immediately interpret him or her for a german audience . shattered illusions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice actors rarely get the red-carpet treatment in berlin but just how far does one go when matching voice to face ?
are all those screen sirens and hollywood hunks just as sexy in their german counterparts ?
or as similar in other ways to the original actor ? likeness is relative , especially if you consider that there are no black dubbing actors in germany , so big stars like denzel washington , halle berry and morgan freeman are all played by white voice actors . rainer raschevski has been in the business for 16 years and runs a big studio in berlin called media factory .
when he was starting out as a young sound engineer all those years ago , he was shocked to see the famous actors unmasked .
" the first day i came into the company restaurant , i heard the german ' john wayne ' order a beer behind me , " raschevski said .
" i was impressed until i turned around to see the guy and he looked completely different than the original .
it 's kind of said for the voice actors .
no one knows that they do one hell of a job . " acting pains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does color matter ?
halle berry 's german counterpart is a white woman dubbing actors have to speak at exactly the same time as their screen persona .
if they end just a second too late , the scene has to be recorded again . and , not only are they lip-syncing the german lines , they also have to mimic the inflections of the original actor . yet despite versatility in acting and portraying a range of emotions , one of the biggest complaints about dubbing is that is like a cultural homogeniser - a kind of machine where the world 's rich cultural vibrancy goes in one end and a world in which everyone speaks perfect german comes out the other . for hollywood films , script adaptor alexander löwe said that to convey the original meaning in a film , it is vital to have a rich understanding of both the english language and american culture . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia roberts is charming even in german but then there are always cultural traps , like translating hip hop lingo such " fo ' shizzle my nizzle -lrb- some say it means " for sure , my nigger " -rrb- or conveying a joke that relies on a pun . one case in particular is the movie " terminal , " starring tom hanks , about a man - " viktor navorski " - who is supposedly from a former russian state and is forced to live in an american airport because he doesn ’ t have a valid passport . viktor has a very strong accent in the film and during one scene , he is trying to explain to a young man that some woman is being cheated on by her husband .
he says " he cheat , he cheat , he cheat . " the young guy , because he only understands spanish and some crude english , understands " eat shit , eat shit , eat shit . " as löwe points out , " you just ca n't get that funny misunderstanding across .
you ca n't translate that . " a picture says a thousand words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faceless , german dubbing actors would never make tinseltown in addition to things getting lost in translation , another source of dubbing frustration for viewers is watching faces that move out of sync with the voices they hear . because in german it usually takes more words to say something than in english , the adaptors have to come up with a german sentence as short as in english , without losing the meaning , and which roughly matches up with the on-screen actor 's mouth . yet even if the synchronization is off-track , it is still a minor complaint compared to a poor translation . one of the most famous mistakes is in the classic hollywood film " casablanca . "

german dubbers as hollywood 's unsung heros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german , bogart says " look into my eyes , babe " rather than " here 's lookin ' at you , kid " in german , julia roberts is a different kind of sexy .
her " pretty woman " character 's lines are translated , just like in other hollywood films .
ever since world war ii , germans have had a love affair with dubbing films . dubbing means that every word of script in a movie is re-written and recorded in a foreign language .
the method is also known as " synchronization " because the new dialogue is supposed to sync up with the original actor 's mouth . german actors get linked to a hollywood star for the duration of that star 's career .
christian brückner , for instance , is a household name .
that 's because he is the german " voice " for robert de niro .
he also voice-acts parts played by warren beatty , harvey keitel , dennis hopper and marlon brando . other voice actors , however , are unsung heroes .
you would likely not recognize them on the street because they work behind the scenes . " dub city " berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " robert de niro " : voice christian brückner germany 's dubbing heartland is berlin , where recording companies vie to synchronize everything from tv commercials and sitcoms to the latest hollywood blockbuster . casting agent thomas fremd , sitting at his desk behind a vast pile of recording schedules with highlighted names , knows how to match voices with faces . " we have 30 dubbing companies in berlin and all of them use the same actors so it 's important to catch the right ones at the right time , " fremd said . a good actor , fremd believes , can see a character played one time by a star and immediately interpret him or her for a german audience . shattered illusions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice actors rarely get the red-carpet treatment in berlin but just how far does one go when matching voice to face ?
are all those screen sirens and hollywood hunks just as sexy in their german counterparts ?
or as similar in other ways to the original actor ? likeness is relative , especially if you consider that there are no black dubbing actors in germany , so big stars like denzel washington , halle berry and morgan freeman are all played by white voice actors . rainer raschevski has been in the business for 16 years and runs a big studio in berlin called media factory .
when he was starting out as a young sound engineer all those years ago , he was shocked to see the famous actors unmasked .
" the first day i came into the company restaurant , i heard the german ' john wayne ' order a beer behind me , " raschevski said .
" i was impressed until i turned around to see the guy and he looked completely different than the original .
it 's kind of said for the voice actors .
no one knows that they do one hell of a job . " acting pains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does color matter ?
halle berry 's german counterpart is a white woman dubbing actors have to speak at exactly the same time as their screen persona .
if they end just a second too late , the scene has to be recorded again . and , not only are they lip-syncing the german lines , they also have to mimic the inflections of the original actor . yet despite versatility in acting and portraying a range of emotions , one of the biggest complaints about dubbing is that is like a cultural homogeniser - a kind of machine where the world 's rich cultural vibrancy goes in one end and a world in which everyone speaks perfect german comes out the other . for hollywood films , script adaptor alexander löwe said that to convey the original meaning in a film , it is vital to have a rich understanding of both the english language and american culture . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia roberts is charming even in german but then there are always cultural traps , like translating hip hop lingo such " fo ' shizzle my nizzle -lrb- some say it means " for sure , my nigger " -rrb- or conveying a joke that relies on a pun . one case in particular is the movie " terminal , " starring tom hanks , about a man - " viktor navorski " - who is supposedly from a former russian state and is forced to live in an american airport because he doesn ’ t have a valid passport . viktor has a very strong accent in the film and during one scene , he is trying to explain to a young man that some woman is being cheated on by her husband .
he says " he cheat , he cheat , he cheat . " the young guy , because he only understands spanish and some crude english , understands " eat shit , eat shit , eat shit . " as löwe points out , " you just ca n't get that funny misunderstanding across .
you ca n't translate that . " a picture says a thousand words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faceless , german dubbing actors would never make tinseltown in addition to things getting lost in translation , another source of dubbing frustration for viewers is watching faces that move out of sync with the voices they hear . because in german it usually takes more words to say something than in english , the adaptors have to come up with a german sentence as short as in english , without losing the meaning , and which roughly matches up with the on-screen actor 's mouth . yet even if the synchronization is off-track , it is still a minor complaint compared to a poor translation . one of the most famous mistakes is in the classic hollywood film " casablanca . "
in the original , humphrey bogart 's character says to love interest ingrid bergman " here 's looking at you , kid ... "
but in the german version , he says " look into my eyes , babe ... "
-lrb- schau ' mir in die augen , kleines . -rrb-

the government hopes to use its eu presidency to make advances in this area . germany has already vowed to make energy a top priority when it takes over the eu presidency next month .
one of its aims is to examine africa 's particular problems in this area .
with some 535 million people across the continent currently without access to electricity , government development experts say better provision is the key to tackling poverty . high gas , oil and electricity prices are curbing growth in many african states that do n't have natural resources that provide energy .
this extra financial burden is using up funds that are desperately needed for other , more pressing purposes .
the rise in the cost of crude oil imports now almost outweighs the entire international aid budget . in african oil-producing countries , such as nigeria , the picture is a little different .
not only are their exports worth more , production here is also on the rise .
in west africa alone , it increased by 36 percent over the last 10 years .
however , corruption and poor government often mean profits are frequently not used to aid social and economic development . european energy strategy europe 's energy strategy is not sufficiently tied to its aid and development policies , said manfred konukiewitz , a senior official in the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could help africa to make sure revenues from natural resources benefit society " we should not merely view african countries as warehouses for crude oil or gas , or other resources , we should also make these african partners an offer about how to use and develop their own resources in the best possible way for the development of their countries , " konukiewitz said . europe could help promote transparency in african oil-producing states by copying models such as that adopted by the world bank in chad for the construction of the chad-cameroon pipeline , he said .
there the government agreed to earmark part of the extra revenue that would be generated by the pipeline for development purposes as part of the investment deal . promoting renewable energy the german government also wants to promote renewable energies in africa .
ninety percent of people there use traditional biomass to produce energy , usually by burning charcoal and wood .
however , more efficient renewable technologies , such as solar , geothermal , wind and hydroelectric power are also in operation .
the room for expansion is great , according to experts . # b # hydroelectric power provides 96 percent of electricity in 11 african countries .
small decentralized power plants can provide cheap , environmentally friendly electricity to rural areas .
the construction of major dams , such as in china , are looked upon less favorably these days , partly due to their environmental impact .
however , not all international investors are willing to adhere to the guidelines formulated by the world conservation union and the world bank , konukiewitz said . berlin 's push to promote renewable energies is also not likely to please everyone in africa .

seven minutes later at the other end , miroslav klose saw his shot from six meters brilliantly blocked by wolfsburg goalkeeper simon jentzsch . klose also had a weak shot saved by jentzsch before daniel jensen scored with an overhead kick in the 17th minute after wolfsburg failed to clear their lines . bremen had a great chance to go further in front on 34 minutes when awarded a penalty after diego was adjudged to have been fouled in the area but the midfielder fired the resultant spot kick against the foot of the post and wide . wolfsburg made bremen pay four minutes before the break when isaac boakye lobbed a shot over wiese from eight meters . naldo nearly restored bremen 's lead in the 68th minute but jentzsch parried the brazilian 's fierce free kick .
however , jentzsch was rooted to the spot in the 86th minute when naldo fired in an unstoppable shot from another well-worked free kick from the edge of the area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's nuri sahin -lrb- left -rrb- and leverkusen 's andrej voronin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium , bayer leverkusen meanwhile totally outclassed the home side and were fully deserving of their 2-1 win .
andrey voronin put the visitors in front on 24 minutes before substitute stefan kiessling made it 2-1 with a fine counter-attacking goal with 14 minutes remaining . martin amedick pulled one back for dortmund in the 85th minute but it turned out to be too little too late . dortmund 's defeat will increase the pressure on coach bert van marwijk to leave during the winter break rather than at the end of the season as he has already announced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach jürgen klopp will have a lot of cheerleading to do in 2007 mainz will spend christmas in last place with 11 points after the loss to munich , two points shy of hamburg and four points behind borussia mönchengladbach . mönchengladbach lost 2-0 at vfl bochum on friday while hamburg drew 3-3 with alemannia aachen despite leading 3-1 .

seven minutes later at the other end , miroslav klose saw his shot from six meters brilliantly blocked by wolfsburg goalkeeper simon jentzsch . klose also had a weak shot saved by jentzsch before daniel jensen scored with an overhead kick in the 17th minute after wolfsburg failed to clear their lines . bremen had a great chance to go further in front on 34 minutes when awarded a penalty after diego was adjudged to have been fouled in the area but the midfielder fired the resultant spot kick against the foot of the post and wide . wolfsburg made bremen pay four minutes before the break when isaac boakye lobbed a shot over wiese from eight meters . naldo nearly restored bremen 's lead in the 68th minute but jentzsch parried the brazilian 's fierce free kick .
however , jentzsch was rooted to the spot in the 86th minute when naldo fired in an unstoppable shot from another well-worked free kick from the edge of the area . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's nuri sahin -lrb- left -rrb- and leverkusen 's andrej voronin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium , bayer leverkusen meanwhile totally outclassed the home side and were fully deserving of their 2-1 win .
andrey voronin put the visitors in front on 24 minutes before substitute stefan kiessling made it 2-1 with a fine counter-attacking goal with 14 minutes remaining . martin amedick pulled one back for dortmund in the 85th minute but it turned out to be too little too late . dortmund 's defeat will increase the pressure on coach bert van marwijk to leave during the winter break rather than at the end of the season as he has already announced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach jürgen klopp will have a lot of cheerleading to do in 2007 mainz will spend christmas in last place with 11 points after the loss to munich , two points shy of hamburg and four points behind borussia mönchengladbach . mönchengladbach lost 2-0 at vfl bochum on friday while hamburg drew 3-3 with alemannia aachen despite leading 3-1 .

german dubbers as hollywood 's unsung heros großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german , bogart says " look into my eyes , babe " rather than " here 's lookin ' at you , kid " in german , julia roberts is a different kind of sexy .
her " pretty woman " character 's lines are translated , just like in other hollywood films .
ever since world war ii , germans have had a love affair with dubbing films . dubbing means that every word of script in a movie is re-written and recorded in a foreign language .
the method is also known as " synchronization " because the new dialogue is supposed to sync up with the original actor 's mouth . german actors get linked to a hollywood star for the duration of that star 's career .
christian brückner , for instance , is a household name .
that 's because he is the german " voice " for robert de niro .
he also voice-acts parts played by warren beatty , harvey keitel , dennis hopper and marlon brando . other voice actors , however , are unsung heroes .
you would likely not recognize them on the street because they work behind the scenes . " dub city " berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " robert de niro " : voice christian brückner germany 's dubbing heartland is berlin , where recording companies vie to synchronize everything from tv commercials and sitcoms to the latest hollywood blockbuster . casting agent thomas fremd , sitting at his desk behind a vast pile of recording schedules with highlighted names , knows how to match voices with faces . " we have 30 dubbing companies in berlin and all of them use the same actors so it 's important to catch the right ones at the right time , " fremd said . a good actor , fremd believes , can see a character played one time by a star and immediately interpret him or her for a german audience . shattered illusions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voice actors rarely get the red-carpet treatment in berlin but just how far does one go when matching voice to face ?
are all those screen sirens and hollywood hunks just as sexy in their german counterparts ?
or as similar in other ways to the original actor ? likeness is relative , especially if you consider that there are no black dubbing actors in germany , so big stars like denzel washington , halle berry and morgan freeman are all played by white voice actors . rainer raschevski has been in the business for 16 years and runs a big studio in berlin called media factory .
when he was starting out as a young sound engineer all those years ago , he was shocked to see the famous actors unmasked .
" the first day i came into the company restaurant , i heard the german ' john wayne ' order a beer behind me , " raschevski said .
" i was impressed until i turned around to see the guy and he looked completely different than the original .
it 's kind of said for the voice actors .
no one knows that they do one hell of a job . " acting pains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does color matter ?
halle berry 's german counterpart is a white woman dubbing actors have to speak at exactly the same time as their screen persona .
if they end just a second too late , the scene has to be recorded again . and , not only are they lip-syncing the german lines , they also have to mimic the inflections of the original actor . yet despite versatility in acting and portraying a range of emotions , one of the biggest complaints about dubbing is that is like a cultural homogeniser - a kind of machine where the world 's rich cultural vibrancy goes in one end and a world in which everyone speaks perfect german comes out the other . for hollywood films , script adaptor alexander löwe said that to convey the original meaning in a film , it is vital to have a rich understanding of both the english language and american culture . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia roberts is charming even in german but then there are always cultural traps , like translating hip hop lingo such " fo ' shizzle my nizzle -lrb- some say it means " for sure , my nigger " -rrb- or conveying a joke that relies on a pun . one case in particular is the movie " terminal , " starring tom hanks , about a man - " viktor navorski " - who is supposedly from a former russian state and is forced to live in an american airport because he doesn ’ t have a valid passport . viktor has a very strong accent in the film and during one scene , he is trying to explain to a young man that some woman is being cheated on by her husband .
he says " he cheat , he cheat , he cheat . " the young guy , because he only understands spanish and some crude english , understands " eat shit , eat shit , eat shit . " as löwe points out , " you just ca n't get that funny misunderstanding across .
you ca n't translate that . " a picture says a thousand words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faceless , german dubbing actors would never make tinseltown in addition to things getting lost in translation , another source of dubbing frustration for viewers is watching faces that move out of sync with the voices they hear . because in german it usually takes more words to say something than in english , the adaptors have to come up with a german sentence as short as in english , without losing the meaning , and which roughly matches up with the on-screen actor 's mouth . yet even if the synchronization is off-track , it is still a minor complaint compared to a poor translation . one of the most famous mistakes is in the classic hollywood film " casablanca . "
in the original , humphrey bogart 's character says to love interest ingrid bergman " here 's looking at you , kid ... "
but in the german version , he says " look into my eyes , babe ... "
-lrb- schau ' mir in die augen , kleines . -rrb-
a mistake like that would never happen again , löwe said , since us supervisors come to germany to make sure the translations are correct as the films are being synchronized . " once they realized that ' acid head ' in the movie ' apocalypse now " had been translated literally , " löwe said .
" the translator used the german words for ' acid ' and ' head ' - he did n't have a clue that the name meant an lsd junkie . " so , to avoid really horrible translation blunders like " look into my trippin ' out eyes , acid babe " or " i concur whole-heartedly , my african-american brother " -lrb- as the " urban dictionary " says for " fo ' shizzle my nizzle " -rrb- , better watch it in the original . zoie jones / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips : a world cup mystery unfolds forget about law or medicine .

if they end just a second too late , the scene has to be recorded again . and , not only are they lip-syncing the german lines , they also have to mimic the inflections of the original actor . yet despite versatility in acting and portraying a range of emotions , one of the biggest complaints about dubbing is that is like a cultural homogeniser - a kind of machine where the world 's rich cultural vibrancy goes in one end and a world in which everyone speaks perfect german comes out the other . for hollywood films , script adaptor alexander löwe said that to convey the original meaning in a film , it is vital to have a rich understanding of both the english language and american culture . lost in translation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia roberts is charming even in german but then there are always cultural traps , like translating hip hop lingo such " fo ' shizzle my nizzle -lrb- some say it means " for sure , my nigger " -rrb- or conveying a joke that relies on a pun . one case in particular is the movie " terminal , " starring tom hanks , about a man - " viktor navorski " - who is supposedly from a former russian state and is forced to live in an american airport because he doesn ’ t have a valid passport . viktor has a very strong accent in the film and during one scene , he is trying to explain to a young man that some woman is being cheated on by her husband .
he says " he cheat , he cheat , he cheat . " the young guy , because he only understands spanish and some crude english , understands " eat shit , eat shit , eat shit . " as löwe points out , " you just ca n't get that funny misunderstanding across .
you ca n't translate that . " a picture says a thousand words bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faceless , german dubbing actors would never make tinseltown in addition to things getting lost in translation , another source of dubbing frustration for viewers is watching faces that move out of sync with the voices they hear . because in german it usually takes more words to say something than in english , the adaptors have to come up with a german sentence as short as in english , without losing the meaning , and which roughly matches up with the on-screen actor 's mouth . yet even if the synchronization is off-track , it is still a minor complaint compared to a poor translation . one of the most famous mistakes is in the classic hollywood film " casablanca . "
in the original , humphrey bogart 's character says to love interest ingrid bergman " here 's looking at you , kid ... "
but in the german version , he says " look into my eyes , babe ... "
-lrb- schau ' mir in die augen , kleines . -rrb-
a mistake like that would never happen again , löwe said , since us supervisors come to germany to make sure the translations are correct as the films are being synchronized . " once they realized that ' acid head ' in the movie ' apocalypse now " had been translated literally , " löwe said .
" the translator used the german words for ' acid ' and ' head ' - he did n't have a clue that the name meant an lsd junkie . " so , to avoid really horrible translation blunders like " look into my trippin ' out eyes , acid babe " or " i concur whole-heartedly , my african-american brother " -lrb- as the " urban dictionary " says for " fo ' shizzle my nizzle " -rrb- , better watch it in the original . zoie jones / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de read my lips : a world cup mystery unfolds forget about law or medicine .

the government hopes to use its eu presidency to make advances in this area . germany has already vowed to make energy a top priority when it takes over the eu presidency next month .
one of its aims is to examine africa 's particular problems in this area .
with some 535 million people across the continent currently without access to electricity , government development experts say better provision is the key to tackling poverty . high gas , oil and electricity prices are curbing growth in many african states that do n't have natural resources that provide energy .
this extra financial burden is using up funds that are desperately needed for other , more pressing purposes .
the rise in the cost of crude oil imports now almost outweighs the entire international aid budget . in african oil-producing countries , such as nigeria , the picture is a little different .
not only are their exports worth more , production here is also on the rise .
in west africa alone , it increased by 36 percent over the last 10 years .
however , corruption and poor government often mean profits are frequently not used to aid social and economic development . european energy strategy europe 's energy strategy is not sufficiently tied to its aid and development policies , said manfred konukiewitz , a senior official in the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe could help africa to make sure revenues from natural resources benefit society " we should not merely view african countries as warehouses for crude oil or gas , or other resources , we should also make these african partners an offer about how to use and develop their own resources in the best possible way for the development of their countries , " konukiewitz said . europe could help promote transparency in african oil-producing states by copying models such as that adopted by the world bank in chad for the construction of the chad-cameroon pipeline , he said .
there the government agreed to earmark part of the extra revenue that would be generated by the pipeline for development purposes as part of the investment deal . promoting renewable energy the german government also wants to promote renewable energies in africa .
ninety percent of people there use traditional biomass to produce energy , usually by burning charcoal and wood .
however , more efficient renewable technologies , such as solar , geothermal , wind and hydroelectric power are also in operation .
the room for expansion is great , according to experts . # b # hydroelectric power provides 96 percent of electricity in 11 african countries .
small decentralized power plants can provide cheap , environmentally friendly electricity to rural areas .
the construction of major dams , such as in china , are looked upon less favorably these days , partly due to their environmental impact .
however , not all international investors are willing to adhere to the guidelines formulated by the world conservation union and the world bank , konukiewitz said . berlin 's push to promote renewable energies is also not likely to please everyone in africa .
but konukiewitz said the general trend was positive .
" one african energy minister told me : our people want the white man 's energy , and she meant the electricity from the socket where the energy has come from a traditional power plant .
i think this view is slowly changing in africa . " dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german eu presidency germany will take over the rotating eu presidency on jan .

seven minutes later at the other end , miroslav klose saw his shot from six meters brilliantly blocked by wolfsburg goalkeeper simon jentzsch . klose also had a weak shot saved by jentzsch before daniel jensen scored with an overhead kick in the 17th minute after wolfsburg failed to clear their lines . bremen had a great chance to go further in front on 34 minutes when awarded a penalty after diego was adjudged to have been fouled in the area but the midfielder fired the resultant spot kick against the foot of the post and wide . wolfsburg made bremen pay four minutes before the break when isaac boakye lobbed a shot over wiese from eight meters . naldo nearly restored bremen 's lead in the 68th minute but jentzsch parried the brazilian 's fierce free kick .

only around half of the visitors live near the market itself , while nearly 49 percent travel to their favorite christmas market destination . nuremberg 's christkindlesmarkt and the striezelmarkt in dresden are among the best known and most traditional of the markets , while those located at centuries-old castles like wartburg in eisenach or glücksburger schloss on the baltic sea offer a more medieval flair . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany 's hottest christmas market filled with the smell of ginger bread and mulled wine , german christmas markets are known for their cozy atmosphere .

he called on governments across the world to act before it was too late , but paid tribute to the work of groups working for sustainable development .
greater determination and political will was needed from leaders who find it easy to ignore the problem , he said .
writing in a commonwealth publication , he said the challenge was to " mobilise " all of society to tackle the problem .
" climate change is now a critical issue for every commonwealth country , " he wrote in cpq , the quarterly magazine of the commonwealth press union -lrb- cpu -rrb- . "
i believe that mankind has all the necessary skills , resources and ingenuity to tackle climate change effectively " prince charles " the challenge is to find ways to mobilise the whole of their society in tackling this ultimate threat to mankind . "
the prince said that because climate change could not be seen it was easily ignored .
but he said that the world had the ability to combat global warming if it could muster the will to use it .
" i believe that mankind has all the necessary skills , resources and ingenuity to tackle climate change effectively , " he wrote .
" the question is not whether we can do this , but whether we will , and whether we will do so in time to affect the outcome . "
grassroots progress charles said the commonwealth 's 53 countries also needed to improve levels of sustainable development .
but he said he had often been inspired by the " quiet diligence " of grassroots organisations working to achieve this .
last week , the prince launched a project , called accounting for sustainability , to help organisations quantify the environmental and social costs of their actions .
his own charitable food company , duchy originals , is starting to measure the greenhouse gas emissions it produces and the prince has also pledged to reduce his own carbon footprint .
he is cutting down on his use of private planes and encouraging staff to use bicycles .
lindsay ross , cpu executive director , said it welcomed the prince 's comments on the " serious issues which will affect all of us in the future " .

he called on governments across the world to act before it was too late , but paid tribute to the work of groups working for sustainable development .
greater determination and political will was needed from leaders who find it easy to ignore the problem , he said .
writing in a commonwealth publication , he said the challenge was to " mobilise " all of society to tackle the problem .
" climate change is now a critical issue for every commonwealth country , " he wrote in cpq , the quarterly magazine of the commonwealth press union -lrb- cpu -rrb- .
i believe that mankind has all the necessary skills , resources and ingenuity to tackle climate change effectively prince charles " the challenge is to find ways to mobilise the whole of their society in tackling this ultimate threat to mankind . "
the prince said that because climate change could not be seen it was easily ignored .
but he said that the world had the ability to combat global warming if it could muster the will to use it .
" i believe that mankind has all the necessary skills , resources and ingenuity to tackle climate change effectively , " he wrote .
" the question is not whether we can do this , but whether we will , and whether we will do so in time to affect the outcome . "
grassroots progress charles said the commonwealth 's 53 countries also needed to improve levels of sustainable development .
but he said he had often been inspired by the " quiet diligence " of grassroots organisations working to achieve this .
last week , the prince launched a project , called accounting for sustainability , to help organisations quantify the environmental and social costs of their actions .
his own charitable food company , duchy originals , is starting to measure the greenhouse gas emissions it produces and the prince has also pledged to reduce his own carbon footprint .
he is cutting down on his use of private planes and encouraging staff to use bicycles .
lindsay ross , cpu executive director , said it welcomed the prince 's comments on the " serious issues which will affect all of us in the future " .

laden was tracked down by professional elephant hunters after a shoot-to-kill order was issued following the death of a woman on wednesday .
the rogue bull has trampled 14 people to death in the past six months in the north-eastern state , officials say .
humans and elephants have come into greater conflict in recent years as man encroaches on jungle territories .
elephant corridor villagers played drums and brandished flames to scare laden into a corner of a tea estate after he was spotted there , assam wildlife wardens told the bbc .
" as the villagers did their bit to scare the rogue tusker , our forest guards kept firing in the air to drive laden towards the trap hunter dwipen phukan had set for it .
" but it was no easy kill because once in sight of phukan , the elephant charged furiously , " said wildlife chief mc malakar .
mr phukan , a licensed hunter , said : " it was charging towards me and i kept firing .
another few yards and it would have run over me . "
laden was branded a " rogue " - a violent , isolated elephant - in the summer after the deaths reached double figures .
