" i 'm really calm now , i was n't in the beginning , " said the baby 's mother , steffi müller -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
" my partner is also healthy , and so only i posed the risk , but my blood samples are really good .
and that 's why i 'm optimistic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has made strides in fighting the hiv virus müller , who 's been undergoing treatment at the munich clinic ever since she became pregnant , received a strong drug cocktail to suppress the hiv virus and the levels of the virus in her blood were monitored regularly .
in the 38th week of her pregnancy , two weeks before the expected birth , doctors performed a caesarean on müller using a technique that involves the lowest possible amount of blood to prevent the child from coming into contact with her mother 's infectious body fluids . new medicine drastically cuts transmission rate birth is the most crucial step for an infant whose mother carries the hiv virus , said andrea gingelmaier , a doctor at the munich clinic .
she added that the child is largely protected in the womb from the virus due to the placenta . gingelmaier pointed out that rapid strides have been made in the west in preventing the hiv virus from being transmitted from mother to child . " in 1994 , a big study in america found out that a natural transmission rate , which lies between 20 and 25 percent when it comes to hiv transmission from mother to child , could be pushed by down by two-thirds to under 8 percent simply through medicines , " said gingelmaier .
" and if you combine that with a caesarean , the transmission rate can be pushed down further to under 2 percent .
today we often use not just one medicine , but several different ones - a so-called combination therapy .
and with that we 're currently down to a hiv transmission rate of under 1 percent . " steffi müller 's daughter has gotten off to a good start in life .
she has to be treated with antiretroviral syrups for about four weeks until the doctors confirm that she 's in the clear and has n't been infected by her mother . in addition , müller is n't allowed to breastfeed .
experts reckon that breastfeeding alone , depending on the duration , can increase the risk of hiv infection in a baby by about 45 percent .
almost every second hiv-positive child worldwide is infected through breastfeeding , said gingelmaier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are particularly susceptible to the hiv virus according to the world health organization , of the more than three million people who have died of aids worldwide , half a million have been children .
the overwhelming majority of hiv-positive children are infected with the virus during or immediately after birth , the who says . success not repeated in africa but the admirable progress made in germany and the rest of the western world in combating aids is hardly being repeated in the rest of the world , particularly in africa . a lack of proper medical infrastructure , exorbitantly high prices for medicines and a lack of awareness about things like breastfeeding are some of the main reasons why negligible transmission rates from mother to child in germany are unlikely to be reached in africa in the foreseeable future , according to gingelmaier . " it 's a huge problem in these countries .
even if the woman does n't breastfeed it 's a problem , because you 're then exposed as being hiv-positive and have to deal with social stigmatization , " said gingelmaier . the un for its part has said that it simply lacks the funds for a concerted effort to battle the infection in africa . the un special commissioner for hiv / aids , stephen lewis , has said that the global health fund , into which all big industrialized countries pay money to combat health problems such as aids , tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries , is in dire need of more funds .
it lacks more than $ 3 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- for the years 2006 and 2007 , he said . maren hellwege-beck -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .

suspicions of customs officials on a train travelling from the netherlands to switzerland were raised by a stuffed teddy bear which seemed a bit too heavy .
turned out , he was stuffed with 50,000 euros worth of cocaine . who 'd suspect a 15-year-old teenage girl with a big teddy bear to be a drug runner ? customs officials on a high-speed train heading to basel , switzerland from amsterdam were n't fooled by the ruse , especially after they picked up the 80-centimeter -lrb- 31.5-inch -rrb- bear during a check and found it strangely heavy .
on closer examination , they noticed that teddy had been operated on .
he had some stitches on his belly that were n't from the manufacturer . " a friend in amsterdam give me the teddy bear as a gift , " the girl told officials after repeated questions about her fuzzy friend 's origin . only when pressed further did she come clean .
turns out , teddy was n't there to provide companionship or act as a big soft pillow to snuggle up against ; teddy was running drugs - in his belly . there were 72 packets of cocaine that had been sewn into the big bear .
the powder 's street value was estimated at around 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , although the teenager did n't get near that amount to carry the stuff .
she told police she 'd been paid just under 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,576 -rrb- . german police handed the girl over to swiss authorities and now , according to a spokesperson , an investigation has begun into the individuals behind the failed smuggling attempt . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soft drugs with hard consequences cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in germany .

he agreed with police officers who said that a person running amok would not be the typical situation . " in order to avoid such incidents you 'd have to make sure that people did n't come together in large crowds , and that would mean doing away with all public viewing areas during the world cup - that 's out of the question , " schäuble said .
" this is not a problem that must be linked to the world cup . " schäuble added that all possible precautions were being taken to guarantee the safety of the people gathering at hundreds of public viewing areas across the country during the tournament .
he also criticized demands to ban the sale of alcohol to partying soccer fans as unrealistic . anti-racism campaigns the head of the german organizing committee , franz beckenbauer , said that anti-racism campaigns would feature prominently during the sports event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has launched a hospitality campaign to help guests feel more welcome " here in germany we 've seen the need for additional service and friendliness campaigns to ensure that visitors will feel at home , " beckenbauer said .
" we 're poised to show the world that we 're friendly hosts .
we have the best of intentions - the rest is in god 's hands . " schäuble too was anxious to stress german hospitality after a spate of negative publicity over racist attacks . " germany is an open , peaceful and tolerant country , and we will show that during the world cup , " he said . preventing hooliganism the interior minister also gave an assurance that everything possible had been done in the run-up to the world cup to avoid any incidents involving hooligan violence .
he praised what he called the " excellent cooperation " with the police and state authorities from the participating nations . in britain , more than 3,000 known soccer hooligans have been called upon to hand over their passports to police to prevent them from traveling to the world cup in germany .
they will also be required to register at a police station each time england play during the tournament .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- . " we will take legal recourse against the states , " he said in an interview with the paper , adding that the hospitals were not able to make up for the lost income on their own . doctors originally began their strikes on march 16 with a series of one-day walkouts and on monday , they began another stage of their walk-out , promising strikes that would affect all but emergency services in 38 public hospitals in nine federal states this week . more than 12,500 doctors walked off the job yesterday demanding a 30 percent pay increase and better working conditions , including regular working hours , overtime pay and time during the working week to conduct research . the hospitals say the states should be required to provide compensation since they share the blame in not finding a way to end the prolonged strike . " completely absurd " the employers ' head negotiator , lower saxony finance minister hartmut möllring , has called the demands for compensation " completely absurd , " saying there is no " legal claim to successful wage negotiations . "
he added that such compensation would make little sense , since the states would be in effect paying themselves , since the hospitals in questions are public facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking doctors want better wages and working conditions " it would be like the right hand paying the left one , " möllring said . the two sides in the debate have failed to reach an agreement even after weeks of intense negotiations .
in mid-may , the marburger bund , a doctors ' union , broke off talks with state negotiators .
the union has promised to resume work next week , but to strike again during the following week , with the world cup in full swing . some have worried that medical care during the huge event , which is expected to bring 3.5 million visitors to germany , could be compromised . still , the chairman of the marburger bund , frank ulrich montgomery , said that despite the pumped-up rhetoric , he thinks chances are good that an agreement will be wrapped up soon , as long as the states " abandon their stonewalling at the expense of patients and hospitals and return to the negotiating table . "
the union has indicated it is willing to compromise on some of its original demands . negotiator möllring , however , said the ball was now in the union 's court . " those who walk away from the table are the ones who have to come back to it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de university doctors enter week-long strike doctors at 25 university clinics and 14 state hospitals across germany have expanded ongoing strikes , leading to the largest physician work-stoppage in the country 's history .

but the city council , which gives the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,190 -rrb- , must approve their decision .
a vote has been scheduled for june 22 . " we 're not going to make the money available , " said one city council member . what 's the damage ? editorialists were divided on the likely decision to withhold the prize . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich heine " no one is going to dispute that this is an open affront against the jury , " wrote the left-wing fra n kfurter ru n dschau .

handke had described milosevic as " a man who defended his people . " while handke , who lives in france , refused to comment on the controversy regarding the decision to award him the prize , he answered his critics in an op-ed piece in the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g on tuesday .

" i 'm really calm now , i was n't in the beginning , " said the baby 's mother , steffi müller -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
" my partner is also healthy , and so only i posed the risk , but my blood samples are really good .
and that 's why i 'm optimistic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has made strides in fighting the hiv virus müller , who 's been undergoing treatment at the munich clinic ever since she became pregnant , received a strong drug cocktail to suppress the hiv virus and the levels of the virus in her blood were monitored regularly .
in the 38th week of her pregnancy , two weeks before the expected birth , doctors performed a caesarean on müller using a technique that involves the lowest possible amount of blood to prevent the child from coming into contact with her mother 's infectious body fluids . new medicine drastically cuts transmission rate birth is the most crucial step for an infant whose mother carries the hiv virus , said andrea gingelmaier , a doctor at the munich clinic .
she added that the child is largely protected in the womb from the virus due to the placenta . gingelmaier pointed out that rapid strides have been made in the west in preventing the hiv virus from being transmitted from mother to child . " in 1994 , a big study in america found out that a natural transmission rate , which lies between 20 and 25 percent when it comes to hiv transmission from mother to child , could be pushed by down by two-thirds to under 8 percent simply through medicines , " said gingelmaier .
" and if you combine that with a caesarean , the transmission rate can be pushed down further to under 2 percent .
today we often use not just one medicine , but several different ones - a so-called combination therapy .
and with that we 're currently down to a hiv transmission rate of under 1 percent . " steffi müller 's daughter has gotten off to a good start in life .
she has to be treated with antiretroviral syrups for about four weeks until the doctors confirm that she 's in the clear and has n't been infected by her mother . in addition , müller is n't allowed to breastfeed .
experts reckon that breastfeeding alone , depending on the duration , can increase the risk of hiv infection in a baby by about 45 percent .
almost every second hiv-positive child worldwide is infected through breastfeeding , said gingelmaier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are particularly susceptible to the hiv virus according to the world health organization , of the more than three million people who have died of aids worldwide , half a million have been children .

" i 'm really calm now , i was n't in the beginning , " said the baby 's mother , steffi müller -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
" my partner is also healthy , and so only i posed the risk , but my blood samples are really good .
and that 's why i 'm optimistic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has made strides in fighting the hiv virus müller , who 's been undergoing treatment at the munich clinic ever since she became pregnant , received a strong drug cocktail to suppress the hiv virus and the levels of the virus in her blood were monitored regularly .
in the 38th week of her pregnancy , two weeks before the expected birth , doctors performed a caesarean on müller using a technique that involves the lowest possible amount of blood to prevent the child from coming into contact with her mother 's infectious body fluids . new medicine drastically cuts transmission rate birth is the most crucial step for an infant whose mother carries the hiv virus , said andrea gingelmaier , a doctor at the munich clinic .
she added that the child is largely protected in the womb from the virus due to the placenta . gingelmaier pointed out that rapid strides have been made in the west in preventing the hiv virus from being transmitted from mother to child . " in 1994 , a big study in america found out that a natural transmission rate , which lies between 20 and 25 percent when it comes to hiv transmission from mother to child , could be pushed by down by two-thirds to under 8 percent simply through medicines , " said gingelmaier .
" and if you combine that with a caesarean , the transmission rate can be pushed down further to under 2 percent .
today we often use not just one medicine , but several different ones - a so-called combination therapy .
and with that we 're currently down to a hiv transmission rate of under 1 percent . " steffi müller 's daughter has gotten off to a good start in life .
she has to be treated with antiretroviral syrups for about four weeks until the doctors confirm that she 's in the clear and has n't been infected by her mother . in addition , müller is n't allowed to breastfeed .
experts reckon that breastfeeding alone , depending on the duration , can increase the risk of hiv infection in a baby by about 45 percent .
almost every second hiv-positive child worldwide is infected through breastfeeding , said gingelmaier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are particularly susceptible to the hiv virus according to the world health organization , of the more than three million people who have died of aids worldwide , half a million have been children .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- . " we will take legal recourse against the states , " he said in an interview with the paper , adding that the hospitals were not able to make up for the lost income on their own . doctors originally began their strikes on march 16 with a series of one-day walkouts and on monday , they began another stage of their walk-out , promising strikes that would affect all but emergency services in 38 public hospitals in nine federal states this week . more than 12,500 doctors walked off the job yesterday demanding a 30 percent pay increase and better working conditions , including regular working hours , overtime pay and time during the working week to conduct research . the hospitals say the states should be required to provide compensation since they share the blame in not finding a way to end the prolonged strike . " completely absurd " the employers ' head negotiator , lower saxony finance minister hartmut möllring , has called the demands for compensation " completely absurd , " saying there is no " legal claim to successful wage negotiations . "
he added that such compensation would make little sense , since the states would be in effect paying themselves , since the hospitals in questions are public facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking doctors want better wages and working conditions " it would be like the right hand paying the left one , " möllring said . the two sides in the debate have failed to reach an agreement even after weeks of intense negotiations .
in mid-may , the marburger bund , a doctors ' union , broke off talks with state negotiators .
the union has promised to resume work next week , but to strike again during the following week , with the world cup in full swing . some have worried that medical care during the huge event , which is expected to bring 3.5 million visitors to germany , could be compromised . still , the chairman of the marburger bund , frank ulrich montgomery , said that despite the pumped-up rhetoric , he thinks chances are good that an agreement will be wrapped up soon , as long as the states " abandon their stonewalling at the expense of patients and hospitals and return to the negotiating table . "
the union has indicated it is willing to compromise on some of its original demands . negotiator möllring , however , said the ball was now in the union 's court . " those who walk away from the table are the ones who have to come back to it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de university doctors enter week-long strike doctors at 25 university clinics and 14 state hospitals across germany have expanded ongoing strikes , leading to the largest physician work-stoppage in the country 's history .

" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .
and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .
back then , idiots lived on the outskirts of the city-state .
their bad judgment in political matters made them outsiders .

" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .
and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .

" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .
and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .
back then , idiots lived on the outskirts of the city-state .
their bad judgment in political matters made them outsiders .
they were not necessarily stupid , but definitely unreasonable .
you did n't want to have anything to do with them .
they were almost as bad as foreigners . what is happening in germany right now , however , is outrageous and idiotic - in almost every sense of the word .
an independent jury awarded germany 's most prestigious prize to one of the most famous - and most difficult - writers in the german language today .
the mayor of düsseldorf called the writer personally to congratulate him .
the writer said , " thank you very much , i 'm thrilled . "
but then the political cry-baby establishment got all huffed up because the writer - whose literary genius is not questioned - is a political " idiot . " for the media , it 's a field day . a comedy of situation ? bowing to the pressure of vociferous critics and he-said-she-said media reports , a member of the jury , a historian-turned-politician , publicly distanced himself from the problematic writer - but only post factum , after the prize announcement bearing his signature was made public and the general hullabaloo came over germany .
other politicians - encouraged by the tardy return of at least one prodigal son - turned to hyperbole and , all of a sudden , the writer started sounding like an epitome of evil , lucifer with an austrian accent who ascended directly from hell to spread hate and destruction . handke , at least , admitted he was an idiot .
but the german political establishment - and especially the local politicos who rarely , if ever , get a chance to speak to a national , let alone , international audience - should pause for a moment to reflect on what they have done .
by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent jury , they have seriously damaged not only their own reputation , but the very institution of the heinrich heine prize . whoever gets this award next should think twice before accepting it - unless things are made clear and the prize gets its name changed to " heinrich heine prize for political correctness . " let 's be serious .
who needs literary critics and philosophers - not to mention literature itself - if local politicos will always know better ? toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans divided over prize for pro-serb author handke the decision to award the city of düsseldorf 's prestigious heine prize to controversial austrian author peter handke - known for his pro-serbian stance during the balkan wars - has been met with criticism in germany .

the security officials allegedly stumbled on the suspects in internet chat rooms . citing an unnamed high-ranking security expert , berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported on wednesday that three german women who have converted to islam allegedly planned suicide bomb attacks in iraq and pakistan . however intelligence authorities apparently managed to prevent the women , aged between 20 and 40 , from traveling to iraq in recent weeks , the paper said .
one of the women comes from berlin , the other two from southern germany . suspected suicide bomber wanted to take child along another newspaper der berliner zeitung reported that the 40-year-old women from berlin also planned to involve her young child in the attack . " she apparently planned to draw her two-year-old child , who lives with her , along with her to death , " the paper quoted an unnamed police source in berlin .
one of the other women also apparently planned to take her one-year-old child with her to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of hamas suicide bombers with fake dynamite strapped around their chests the papers reported that the three were believed to have close contacts to the islamist scene in germany and adopted radical views through contacts in islamist chat rooms on the internet and under the influence of their islamist partners .
the berlin criminal police office is said to have stumbled on the three suspects after they voiced their plans in an islamist internet forum under a variety of code names . the 40-year-old berliner reportedly announced she planned to blow herself up in iraq and hoped to gain entry to paradise in this way , the berliner zeitung quoted an official from the berlin criminal police office as saying .
the youth office in berlin has apparently taken away the child of the 40-year-old berliner and sent her to a psychiatric clinic . no formal legal proceedings have been opened against the women as yet , but police have searched the apartment of the berliner . contacts to iraqi terrorist group ? though police remain tight-lipped about whether the women 's intentions to carry out suicide attacks on us troops in iraq and in pakistan were serious , media reports say the authorities are probing whether the women had contacts to the iraqi terrorist group ansar al islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police officers guard 31-year-old iraqi amin lokman mohammed ansar al islam - also known as ansar al sunna , a group that has carried out several attacks in iraq - is also active in germany .
in january this year a court in munich sentenced a ansar al islam member , lokman mohammed , to seven years in prison for recruiting young muslims with german passports for " jihad " or holy war in iraq as well as smuggling foreigners to germany . in december 2004 , police in berlin , stuttgart and augsburg arrested three suspected members of ansar al islam who are believed to have planned an attack on then iraqi prime minister ijad allawi during an official visit to berlin in the same year .
in addition , further cases against suspected ansar al islam members in germany are pending . not the first case reports of the three suspected female german suicide bombers are n't the first of their kind in western europe . last november , a 38-year-old belgian woman who converted to islam , muriel degauque , blew herself up in iraq , killing several iraqi policemen . der tagesspiegel quoted a security expert as saying the degauque case as well as the suspected german suicide bombers pointed to a growing danger of " home grown terrorism .

he agreed with police officers who said that a person running amok would not be the typical situation . " in order to avoid such incidents you 'd have to make sure that people did n't come together in large crowds , and that would mean doing away with all public viewing areas during the world cup - that 's out of the question , " schäuble said .
" this is not a problem that must be linked to the world cup . " schäuble added that all possible precautions were being taken to guarantee the safety of the people gathering at hundreds of public viewing areas across the country during the tournament .
he also criticized demands to ban the sale of alcohol to partying soccer fans as unrealistic . anti-racism campaigns the head of the german organizing committee , franz beckenbauer , said that anti-racism campaigns would feature prominently during the sports event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has launched a hospitality campaign to help guests feel more welcome " here in germany we 've seen the need for additional service and friendliness campaigns to ensure that visitors will feel at home , " beckenbauer said .
" we 're poised to show the world that we 're friendly hosts .
we have the best of intentions - the rest is in god 's hands . " schäuble too was anxious to stress german hospitality after a spate of negative publicity over racist attacks . " germany is an open , peaceful and tolerant country , and we will show that during the world cup , " he said . preventing hooliganism the interior minister also gave an assurance that everything possible had been done in the run-up to the world cup to avoid any incidents involving hooligan violence .
he praised what he called the " excellent cooperation " with the police and state authorities from the participating nations . in britain , more than 3,000 known soccer hooligans have been called upon to hand over their passports to police to prevent them from traveling to the world cup in germany .
they will also be required to register at a police station each time england play during the tournament .

he agreed with police officers who said that a person running amok would not be the typical situation . " in order to avoid such incidents you 'd have to make sure that people did n't come together in large crowds , and that would mean doing away with all public viewing areas during the world cup - that 's out of the question , " schäuble said .
" this is not a problem that must be linked to the world cup . " schäuble added that all possible precautions were being taken to guarantee the safety of the people gathering at hundreds of public viewing areas across the country during the tournament .

" we 're poised to show the world that we 're friendly hosts .
we have the best of intentions - the rest is in god 's hands . " schäuble too was anxious to stress german hospitality after a spate of negative publicity over racist attacks . " germany is an open , peaceful and tolerant country , and we will show that during the world cup , " he said . preventing hooliganism the interior minister also gave an assurance that everything possible had been done in the run-up to the world cup to avoid any incidents involving hooligan violence .
he praised what he called the " excellent cooperation " with the police and state authorities from the participating nations . in britain , more than 3,000 known soccer hooligans have been called upon to hand over their passports to police to prevent them from traveling to the world cup in germany .
they will also be required to register at a police station each time england play during the tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 escalating violence puts german peacekeepers on edge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kabul witnessed some of the worst violence since the fall of the taliban the flare-up of violence in afghanistan comes at a bad time for german soldiers preparing to take over the international peacekeeping force isaf this week .
but the german defense minister wants to keep the troops there . around four and a half years after their first deployment in afghanistan , the german army or bundeswehr faces a new challenge this week when it takes over command of the nato international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- for the whole of northern afghanistan on june 1 . the timing could n't have been worse .
over the past few days , afghanistan has been wracked by some of the worst violence seen since us-led forces toppled the taliban regime end of 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kabul witnessed some severe rioting this week at least 14 people were killed in rioting that gripped the capital kabul monday after a us military truck slammed into civilian cars , killing around five people .
fighting has also escalated between coalition soldiers and militants from the ousted taliban regime in the country 's south .
on tuesday , fresh reports said armed men shot dead an afghan man and three women working with international aid group actionaid . but german defense minister franz josef jung is adamant that despite rising tensions , german troops will remain in afghanistan . speaking to german public broadcaster ard on wednesday , jung said he was concerned about recent developments in the country , but that it was all the more necessary to leave peacekeepers there .
" we need more security there , " jung said . " we have to be very alert " in comparison to the volatile south of the country , the situation in northern afghanistan is relatively peaceful .
the taliban and their allies are mostly active in southern and eastern areas , although militants have carried out attacks in some parts of the north too during the past year .
the taliban have declared a holy war against the government , us-led coalition forces , and aid workers , and have killed dozens of relief workers in the past . but the recent upsurge in violence has put the estimated 1,400 german peacekeepers in the country on edge .
the german army has described the situation in the country as " clearly not peaceful and stable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german army tank in kabul " overall we have to be very , very alert , probably more alert than we have been so far , " general markus kneip , the future isaf commander for northern afghanistan told german news agency dpa . in recent months , the 9,000-strong nato troops drawn from 39 countries , have been the target of a string of attacks , even in the north of the country .
last week , a massive explosion in the province of kunduz tore through a tank belonging to the german army .
however , no one was injured .
but a bomb attack in mazar-i-sharif , the future headquarters of german troops in northern afghanistan , last november killed a swedish isaf peacekeeper . germany also paid a high price for its deployment in afghanistan at the beginning of the mission when it lost 18 soldiers in a bomb attack in december 2001 . mission fraught with dangers there 's little doubt that the bundeswehr 's future mission in afghanistan will be fraught with dangers . mazar-i-sharif and its surroundings are home to some of the country 's biggest poppy plantations , from which heroin is extracted .
a combination of drug-related crimes and the presence of warring gang lords in the region are expected to keep the troops busy . in addition , the future bundeswehr military camp in mazar-i-sharif , one of the biggest outside of germany , is expected to be an obvious target for insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer is bolstering troops in afghanistan in an attempt to boost troop morale in the face of mounting violence , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said tuesday that the success of the alliance 's stabilization mission in afghanistan was " vital . " " afghanistan remains our number one priority , and it is absolutely vital , both for the people of afghanistan and for nato , that we are successful , " he said in a speech to the nato parliamentary assembly meeting in paris . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gripped by christian convert trial in afghanistan it may be taking place thousands of miles away , but the trial of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul and a possible looming death sentence have whipped up emotions in germany and other western nations .
-lrb- march 24 , 2006 -rrb- german soldiers in afghanistan deal with muslim rage nato soldiers stationed in afghanistan are among those taking the heat of muslim anger about the mohammed caricatures which appeared in various european newspapers .
how worried should they be ?

over the past few days , afghanistan has been wracked by some of the worst violence seen since us-led forces toppled the taliban regime end of 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kabul witnessed some severe rioting this week at least 14 people were killed in rioting that gripped the capital kabul monday after a us military truck slammed into civilian cars , killing around five people .
fighting has also escalated between coalition soldiers and militants from the ousted taliban regime in the country 's south .
on tuesday , fresh reports said armed men shot dead an afghan man and three women working with international aid group actionaid . but german defense minister franz josef jung is adamant that despite rising tensions , german troops will remain in afghanistan . speaking to german public broadcaster ard on wednesday , jung said he was concerned about recent developments in the country , but that it was all the more necessary to leave peacekeepers there .
" we need more security there , " jung said . " we have to be very alert " in comparison to the volatile south of the country , the situation in northern afghanistan is relatively peaceful .

a combination of drug-related crimes and the presence of warring gang lords in the region are expected to keep the troops busy . in addition , the future bundeswehr military camp in mazar-i-sharif , one of the biggest outside of germany , is expected to be an obvious target for insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer is bolstering troops in afghanistan in an attempt to boost troop morale in the face of mounting violence , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said tuesday that the success of the alliance 's stabilization mission in afghanistan was " vital .

the taliban have declared a holy war against the government , us-led coalition forces , and aid workers , and have killed dozens of relief workers in the past . but the recent upsurge in violence has put the estimated 1,400 german peacekeepers in the country on edge .
the german army has described the situation in the country as " clearly not peaceful and stable . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german army tank in kabul " overall we have to be very , very alert , probably more alert than we have been so far , " general markus kneip , the future isaf commander for northern afghanistan told german news agency dpa . in recent months , the 9,000-strong nato troops drawn from 39 countries , have been the target of a string of attacks , even in the north of the country .
last week , a massive explosion in the province of kunduz tore through a tank belonging to the german army .
however , no one was injured .
but a bomb attack in mazar-i-sharif , the future headquarters of german troops in northern afghanistan , last november killed a swedish isaf peacekeeper . germany also paid a high price for its deployment in afghanistan at the beginning of the mission when it lost 18 soldiers in a bomb attack in december 2001 . mission fraught with dangers there 's little doubt that the bundeswehr 's future mission in afghanistan will be fraught with dangers . mazar-i-sharif and its surroundings are home to some of the country 's biggest poppy plantations , from which heroin is extracted .
a combination of drug-related crimes and the presence of warring gang lords in the region are expected to keep the troops busy . in addition , the future bundeswehr military camp in mazar-i-sharif , one of the biggest outside of germany , is expected to be an obvious target for insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer is bolstering troops in afghanistan in an attempt to boost troop morale in the face of mounting violence , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said tuesday that the success of the alliance 's stabilization mission in afghanistan was " vital . " " afghanistan remains our number one priority , and it is absolutely vital , both for the people of afghanistan and for nato , that we are successful , " he said in a speech to the nato parliamentary assembly meeting in paris . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany gripped by christian convert trial in afghanistan it may be taking place thousands of miles away , but the trial of an afghan convert to christianity in kabul and a possible looming death sentence have whipped up emotions in germany and other western nations .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- . " we will take legal recourse against the states , " he said in an interview with the paper , adding that the hospitals were not able to make up for the lost income on their own . doctors originally began their strikes on march 16 with a series of one-day walkouts and on monday , they began another stage of their walk-out , promising strikes that would affect all but emergency services in 38 public hospitals in nine federal states this week . more than 12,500 doctors walked off the job yesterday demanding a 30 percent pay increase and better working conditions , including regular working hours , overtime pay and time during the working week to conduct research . the hospitals say the states should be required to provide compensation since they share the blame in not finding a way to end the prolonged strike . " completely absurd " the employers ' head negotiator , lower saxony finance minister hartmut möllring , has called the demands for compensation " completely absurd , " saying there is no " legal claim to successful wage negotiations . "
he added that such compensation would make little sense , since the states would be in effect paying themselves , since the hospitals in questions are public facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking doctors want better wages and working conditions " it would be like the right hand paying the left one , " möllring said . the two sides in the debate have failed to reach an agreement even after weeks of intense negotiations .
in mid-may , the marburger bund , a doctors ' union , broke off talks with state negotiators .
the union has promised to resume work next week , but to strike again during the following week , with the world cup in full swing . some have worried that medical care during the huge event , which is expected to bring 3.5 million visitors to germany , could be compromised . still , the chairman of the marburger bund , frank ulrich montgomery , said that despite the pumped-up rhetoric , he thinks chances are good that an agreement will be wrapped up soon , as long as the states " abandon their stonewalling at the expense of patients and hospitals and return to the negotiating table . "
the union has indicated it is willing to compromise on some of its original demands . negotiator möllring , however , said the ball was now in the union 's court . " those who walk away from the table are the ones who have to come back to it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de university doctors enter week-long strike doctors at 25 university clinics and 14 state hospitals across germany have expanded ongoing strikes , leading to the largest physician work-stoppage in the country 's history .

" i 'm really calm now , i was n't in the beginning , " said the baby 's mother , steffi müller -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
" my partner is also healthy , and so only i posed the risk , but my blood samples are really good .
and that 's why i 'm optimistic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has made strides in fighting the hiv virus müller , who 's been undergoing treatment at the munich clinic ever since she became pregnant , received a strong drug cocktail to suppress the hiv virus and the levels of the virus in her blood were monitored regularly .
in the 38th week of her pregnancy , two weeks before the expected birth , doctors performed a caesarean on müller using a technique that involves the lowest possible amount of blood to prevent the child from coming into contact with her mother 's infectious body fluids . new medicine drastically cuts transmission rate birth is the most crucial step for an infant whose mother carries the hiv virus , said andrea gingelmaier , a doctor at the munich clinic .
she added that the child is largely protected in the womb from the virus due to the placenta . gingelmaier pointed out that rapid strides have been made in the west in preventing the hiv virus from being transmitted from mother to child . " in 1994 , a big study in america found out that a natural transmission rate , which lies between 20 and 25 percent when it comes to hiv transmission from mother to child , could be pushed by down by two-thirds to under 8 percent simply through medicines , " said gingelmaier .
" and if you combine that with a caesarean , the transmission rate can be pushed down further to under 2 percent .
today we often use not just one medicine , but several different ones - a so-called combination therapy .
and with that we 're currently down to a hiv transmission rate of under 1 percent . " steffi müller 's daughter has gotten off to a good start in life .
she has to be treated with antiretroviral syrups for about four weeks until the doctors confirm that she 's in the clear and has n't been infected by her mother . in addition , müller is n't allowed to breastfeed .
experts reckon that breastfeeding alone , depending on the duration , can increase the risk of hiv infection in a baby by about 45 percent .
almost every second hiv-positive child worldwide is infected through breastfeeding , said gingelmaier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are particularly susceptible to the hiv virus according to the world health organization , of the more than three million people who have died of aids worldwide , half a million have been children .
the overwhelming majority of hiv-positive children are infected with the virus during or immediately after birth , the who says . success not repeated in africa but the admirable progress made in germany and the rest of the western world in combating aids is hardly being repeated in the rest of the world , particularly in africa . a lack of proper medical infrastructure , exorbitantly high prices for medicines and a lack of awareness about things like breastfeeding are some of the main reasons why negligible transmission rates from mother to child in germany are unlikely to be reached in africa in the foreseeable future , according to gingelmaier . " it 's a huge problem in these countries .
even if the woman does n't breastfeed it 's a problem , because you 're then exposed as being hiv-positive and have to deal with social stigmatization , " said gingelmaier . the un for its part has said that it simply lacks the funds for a concerted effort to battle the infection in africa . the un special commissioner for hiv / aids , stephen lewis , has said that the global health fund , into which all big industrialized countries pay money to combat health problems such as aids , tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries , is in dire need of more funds .
it lacks more than $ 3 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- for the years 2006 and 2007 , he said . maren hellwege-beck -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 haditha : " the horrible pictures are missing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not graphic enough ?
a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .

a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 haditha : " the horrible pictures are missing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not graphic enough ?
a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .
additionally , there 's a widespread feeling in the arab world that americans constantly commit crimes in iraq .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian fans celebrating without cigarettes in japan in 2002 but that 's not going to prevent people from lighting up as fifa , the world 's soccer body , has lifted a smoking ban put in place during the 2002 cup in south korea and japan .
according to news reports , the decision to allow smoking in stadiums was made after consultations with the german government and the event 's german organization committee . officials for the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , who had worked with fifa to introduce the smoking ban in the first place , said the no smoking announcements were unlikely to have the desired effect . " we know that voluntary tobacco-control agreements do n't work , " marta seoane , the spokeswoman for the who 's anti-smoking campaign , told german public broadcaster swr .
" smoking and tobacco bans have to be introduced to reduce consumption .
the point is to protect public health - the health of viewers in the stadiums and that of people - adults and children - who follow the games on television . " " completely incomprehensible " decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is banned in german train stations , but not restaurants the move to allow smoking in stadiums has outraged anti-smoking activists , who have long criticized the german government 's reluctance to back international initiatives to curb tobacco use , such as a global anti-smoking treaty proposed by the who and which took effect in 2003 .
eu officials have also criticized germany for failing to do more to limit smoking . " it 's completely incomprehensible why we do n't manage " to keep the tournament smoke-free , said dagmar schipanski , president of german cancer aid , adding that smoking will be banned again during the 2010 cup in south africa . others also accused fifa of sending a mixed message to fans by selling branded lighters and ashtrays . " the whole thing is really inconsistent , " sinead jones , the director of the international union against cancer 's global smoke free partnership , told reuters news service .
" they are saying to fans : ' do n't smoke , ' but on the other hand there will be absolutely no enforcement there . " germany still lags behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cigarette machines will only accept credit cards starting in 2007 to prevent teens from buying in germany , anti-smoking groups meanwhile used world no tobacco day to renew calls for more stringent controls .
while a majority of germans support smoking bans in restaurants and bars , so far , only a voluntary agreement to designate 50 percent of seats in 90 percent of restaurants as smoke-free by 2008 exists . " creating smoking and non-smoking areas only appear to solve the problem , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe , the president of the german medical association . according to germany 's federal center for health education , about 140,000 people in germany die each year as a result of smoking .

over the past few days , afghanistan has been wracked by some of the worst violence seen since us-led forces toppled the taliban regime end of 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kabul witnessed some severe rioting this week at least 14 people were killed in rioting that gripped the capital kabul monday after a us military truck slammed into civilian cars , killing around five people .
fighting has also escalated between coalition soldiers and militants from the ousted taliban regime in the country 's south .
on tuesday , fresh reports said armed men shot dead an afghan man and three women working with international aid group actionaid . but german defense minister franz josef jung is adamant that despite rising tensions , german troops will remain in afghanistan . speaking to german public broadcaster ard on wednesday , jung said he was concerned about recent developments in the country , but that it was all the more necessary to leave peacekeepers there .
" we need more security there , " jung said . " we have to be very alert " in comparison to the volatile south of the country , the situation in northern afghanistan is relatively peaceful .
the taliban and their allies are mostly active in southern and eastern areas , although militants have carried out attacks in some parts of the north too during the past year .
the taliban have declared a holy war against the government , us-led coalition forces , and aid workers , and have killed dozens of relief workers in the past . but the recent upsurge in violence has put the estimated 1,400 german peacekeepers in the country on edge .
the german army has described the situation in the country as " clearly not peaceful and stable .

suspicions of customs officials on a train travelling from the netherlands to switzerland were raised by a stuffed teddy bear which seemed a bit too heavy .
turned out , he was stuffed with 50,000 euros worth of cocaine . who 'd suspect a 15-year-old teenage girl with a big teddy bear to be a drug runner ? customs officials on a high-speed train heading to basel , switzerland from amsterdam were n't fooled by the ruse , especially after they picked up the 80-centimeter -lrb- 31.5-inch -rrb- bear during a check and found it strangely heavy .
on closer examination , they noticed that teddy had been operated on .
he had some stitches on his belly that were n't from the manufacturer . " a friend in amsterdam give me the teddy bear as a gift , " the girl told officials after repeated questions about her fuzzy friend 's origin . only when pressed further did she come clean .
turns out , teddy was n't there to provide companionship or act as a big soft pillow to snuggle up against ; teddy was running drugs - in his belly . there were 72 packets of cocaine that had been sewn into the big bear .
the powder 's street value was estimated at around 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , although the teenager did n't get near that amount to carry the stuff .
she told police she 'd been paid just under 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,576 -rrb- . german police handed the girl over to swiss authorities and now , according to a spokesperson , an investigation has begun into the individuals behind the failed smuggling attempt . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soft drugs with hard consequences cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in germany .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- . " we will take legal recourse against the states , " he said in an interview with the paper , adding that the hospitals were not able to make up for the lost income on their own . doctors originally began their strikes on march 16 with a series of one-day walkouts and on monday , they began another stage of their walk-out , promising strikes that would affect all but emergency services in 38 public hospitals in nine federal states this week . more than 12,500 doctors walked off the job yesterday demanding a 30 percent pay increase and better working conditions , including regular working hours , overtime pay and time during the working week to conduct research . the hospitals say the states should be required to provide compensation since they share the blame in not finding a way to end the prolonged strike .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- . " we will take legal recourse against the states , " he said in an interview with the paper , adding that the hospitals were not able to make up for the lost income on their own . doctors originally began their strikes on march 16 with a series of one-day walkouts and on monday , they began another stage of their walk-out , promising strikes that would affect all but emergency services in 38 public hospitals in nine federal states this week . more than 12,500 doctors walked off the job yesterday demanding a 30 percent pay increase and better working conditions , including regular working hours , overtime pay and time during the working week to conduct research . the hospitals say the states should be required to provide compensation since they share the blame in not finding a way to end the prolonged strike . " completely absurd " the employers ' head negotiator , lower saxony finance minister hartmut möllring , has called the demands for compensation " completely absurd , " saying there is no " legal claim to successful wage negotiations . "
he added that such compensation would make little sense , since the states would be in effect paying themselves , since the hospitals in questions are public facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking doctors want better wages and working conditions " it would be like the right hand paying the left one , " möllring said . the two sides in the debate have failed to reach an agreement even after weeks of intense negotiations .
in mid-may , the marburger bund , a doctors ' union , broke off talks with state negotiators .
the union has promised to resume work next week , but to strike again during the following week , with the world cup in full swing . some have worried that medical care during the huge event , which is expected to bring 3.5 million visitors to germany , could be compromised . still , the chairman of the marburger bund , frank ulrich montgomery , said that despite the pumped-up rhetoric , he thinks chances are good that an agreement will be wrapped up soon , as long as the states " abandon their stonewalling at the expense of patients and hospitals and return to the negotiating table . "
the union has indicated it is willing to compromise on some of its original demands . negotiator möllring , however , said the ball was now in the union 's court . " those who walk away from the table are the ones who have to come back to it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de university doctors enter week-long strike doctors at 25 university clinics and 14 state hospitals across germany have expanded ongoing strikes , leading to the largest physician work-stoppage in the country 's history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 haditha : " the horrible pictures are missing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not graphic enough ?
a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .
additionally , there 's a widespread feeling in the arab world that americans constantly commit crimes in iraq .
haditha , therefore , just gets added to the list . mathias bölinger interviewed horst müller -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .
-lrb- aug .
10 , 2004 -rrb- cartoons that shook the world read dw-world.de 's dossier on the scandal over publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammad in european media .
opinion : too much transparency is damaging along with relief over the release of two men held by their kidnappers for 99 days in iraq come speculations in german media about possible ransom payments .
that 's not a good idea , according to dw 's peter philipp .
-lrb- may 3 , 2006 -rrb- feedback do you agree with müller about the importance of pictures to grab public attention ?

but the city council , which gives the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,190 -rrb- , must approve their decision .
a vote has been scheduled for june 22 . " we 're not going to make the money available , " said one city council member . what 's the damage ? editorialists were divided on the likely decision to withhold the prize . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich heine " no one is going to dispute that this is an open affront against the jury , " wrote the left-wing fra n kfurter ru n dschau .
" but first of all , the jury was not united when doubts about the nomination arose .
and secondly , the damage for düsseldorf would be even bigger if it accepted honoring handke in the name of heine . " writers at berlin 's left-wing die tageszeitu n g saw things differently . " heine does n't deserve handke and handke does n't deserve the heine prize , " it wrote .
" but there 's no doubt that heine would have rejected the political control of a jury .
this form of censorship would be much worse than awarding the prize to the wrong person . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a milosevic supporter holds a picture of the late serbian leader during a memorial in belgrade the move to honor handke came just a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays because of a eulogy he delivered for milosevic , the former yugoslav president and alleged war criminal who died in march .
handke had described milosevic as " a man who defended his people . " while handke , who lives in france , refused to comment on the controversy regarding the decision to award him the prize , he answered his critics in an op-ed piece in the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g on tuesday . " nowhere in my work i have called slobodan milosevic ' one ' or ' the ' victim , " he wrote . un report : milosevic n ot poiso n ed while some milosevic supporters have claimed that he was poisoned in his prison cell in the hague , a new report published wednesday said that he had self-medicated himself and that experts could not agree whether surgery could have prevented his death . " nothing has been found to support allegations reported in some sections of the media that mr milosevic has been murdered , " the report reads , according to reuters news service . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans divided over prize for pro-serb author handke the decision to award the city of düsseldorf 's prestigious heine prize to controversial austrian author peter handke - known for his pro-serbian stance during the balkan wars - has been met with criticism in germany .

he agreed with police officers who said that a person running amok would not be the typical situation . " in order to avoid such incidents you 'd have to make sure that people did n't come together in large crowds , and that would mean doing away with all public viewing areas during the world cup - that 's out of the question , " schäuble said .
" this is not a problem that must be linked to the world cup . " schäuble added that all possible precautions were being taken to guarantee the safety of the people gathering at hundreds of public viewing areas across the country during the tournament .
he also criticized demands to ban the sale of alcohol to partying soccer fans as unrealistic . anti-racism campaigns the head of the german organizing committee , franz beckenbauer , said that anti-racism campaigns would feature prominently during the sports event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has launched a hospitality campaign to help guests feel more welcome " here in germany we 've seen the need for additional service and friendliness campaigns to ensure that visitors will feel at home , " beckenbauer said .

we have the best of intentions - the rest is in god 's hands . " schäuble too was anxious to stress german hospitality after a spate of negative publicity over racist attacks . " germany is an open , peaceful and tolerant country , and we will show that during the world cup , " he said . preventing hooliganism the interior minister also gave an assurance that everything possible had been done in the run-up to the world cup to avoid any incidents involving hooligan violence .
he praised what he called the " excellent cooperation " with the police and state authorities from the participating nations . in britain , more than 3,000 known soccer hooligans have been called upon to hand over their passports to police to prevent them from traveling to the world cup in germany .
they will also be required to register at a police station each time england play during the tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 haditha : " the horrible pictures are missing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not graphic enough ?
a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .

but the city council , which gives the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,190 -rrb- , must approve their decision .
a vote has been scheduled for june 22 . " we 're not going to make the money available , " said one city council member . what 's the damage ? editorialists were divided on the likely decision to withhold the prize . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich heine " no one is going to dispute that this is an open affront against the jury , " wrote the left-wing fra n kfurter ru n dschau .
" but first of all , the jury was not united when doubts about the nomination arose .
and secondly , the damage for düsseldorf would be even bigger if it accepted honoring handke in the name of heine . " writers at berlin 's left-wing die tageszeitu n g saw things differently . " heine does n't deserve handke and handke does n't deserve the heine prize , " it wrote .
" but there 's no doubt that heine would have rejected the political control of a jury .
this form of censorship would be much worse than awarding the prize to the wrong person . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a milosevic supporter holds a picture of the late serbian leader during a memorial in belgrade the move to honor handke came just a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays because of a eulogy he delivered for milosevic , the former yugoslav president and alleged war criminal who died in march .
handke had described milosevic as " a man who defended his people . " while handke , who lives in france , refused to comment on the controversy regarding the decision to award him the prize , he answered his critics in an op-ed piece in the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g on tuesday . " nowhere in my work i have called slobodan milosevic ' one ' or ' the ' victim , " he wrote . un report : milosevic n ot poiso n ed while some milosevic supporters have claimed that he was poisoned in his prison cell in the hague , a new report published wednesday said that he had self-medicated himself and that experts could not agree whether surgery could have prevented his death . " nothing has been found to support allegations reported in some sections of the media that mr milosevic has been murdered , " the report reads , according to reuters news service . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans divided over prize for pro-serb author handke the decision to award the city of düsseldorf 's prestigious heine prize to controversial austrian author peter handke - known for his pro-serbian stance during the balkan wars - has been met with criticism in germany .

" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .
and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .
back then , idiots lived on the outskirts of the city-state .
their bad judgment in political matters made them outsiders .
they were not necessarily stupid , but definitely unreasonable .
you did n't want to have anything to do with them .
they were almost as bad as foreigners . what is happening in germany right now , however , is outrageous and idiotic - in almost every sense of the word .
an independent jury awarded germany 's most prestigious prize to one of the most famous - and most difficult - writers in the german language today .
the mayor of düsseldorf called the writer personally to congratulate him .
the writer said , " thank you very much , i 'm thrilled . "
but then the political cry-baby establishment got all huffed up because the writer - whose literary genius is not questioned - is a political " idiot . " for the media , it 's a field day . a comedy of situation ? bowing to the pressure of vociferous critics and he-said-she-said media reports , a member of the jury , a historian-turned-politician , publicly distanced himself from the problematic writer - but only post factum , after the prize announcement bearing his signature was made public and the general hullabaloo came over germany .
other politicians - encouraged by the tardy return of at least one prodigal son - turned to hyperbole and , all of a sudden , the writer started sounding like an epitome of evil , lucifer with an austrian accent who ascended directly from hell to spread hate and destruction . handke , at least , admitted he was an idiot .
but the german political establishment - and especially the local politicos who rarely , if ever , get a chance to speak to a national , let alone , international audience - should pause for a moment to reflect on what they have done .
by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent jury , they have seriously damaged not only their own reputation , but the very institution of the heinrich heine prize . whoever gets this award next should think twice before accepting it - unless things are made clear and the prize gets its name changed to " heinrich heine prize for political correctness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 opinion : a truly idiotic decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a perfect match : heine and handke by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent literary jury , german politicians are embarrassing themselves and damaging the fundaments of democratic culture , says dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . when peter handke received an honorary doctorate from the university of salzburg in 2003 , he promised he would withdraw from public life .
" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .
and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .
back then , idiots lived on the outskirts of the city-state .
their bad judgment in political matters made them outsiders .
they were not necessarily stupid , but definitely unreasonable .
you did n't want to have anything to do with them .
they were almost as bad as foreigners . what is happening in germany right now , however , is outrageous and idiotic - in almost every sense of the word .
an independent jury awarded germany 's most prestigious prize to one of the most famous - and most difficult - writers in the german language today .
the mayor of düsseldorf called the writer personally to congratulate him .
the writer said , " thank you very much , i 'm thrilled . "
but then the political cry-baby establishment got all huffed up because the writer - whose literary genius is not questioned - is a political " idiot . " for the media , it 's a field day . a comedy of situation ? bowing to the pressure of vociferous critics and he-said-she-said media reports , a member of the jury , a historian-turned-politician , publicly distanced himself from the problematic writer - but only post factum , after the prize announcement bearing his signature was made public and the general hullabaloo came over germany .

he agreed with police officers who said that a person running amok would not be the typical situation . " in order to avoid such incidents you 'd have to make sure that people did n't come together in large crowds , and that would mean doing away with all public viewing areas during the world cup - that 's out of the question , " schäuble said .
" this is not a problem that must be linked to the world cup . " schäuble added that all possible precautions were being taken to guarantee the safety of the people gathering at hundreds of public viewing areas across the country during the tournament .
he also criticized demands to ban the sale of alcohol to partying soccer fans as unrealistic . anti-racism campaigns the head of the german organizing committee , franz beckenbauer , said that anti-racism campaigns would feature prominently during the sports event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has launched a hospitality campaign to help guests feel more welcome " here in germany we 've seen the need for additional service and friendliness campaigns to ensure that visitors will feel at home , " beckenbauer said .
" we 're poised to show the world that we 're friendly hosts .
we have the best of intentions - the rest is in god 's hands . " schäuble too was anxious to stress german hospitality after a spate of negative publicity over racist attacks . " germany is an open , peaceful and tolerant country , and we will show that during the world cup , " he said . preventing hooliganism the interior minister also gave an assurance that everything possible had been done in the run-up to the world cup to avoid any incidents involving hooligan violence .
he praised what he called the " excellent cooperation " with the police and state authorities from the participating nations . in britain , more than 3,000 known soccer hooligans have been called upon to hand over their passports to police to prevent them from traveling to the world cup in germany .
they will also be required to register at a police station each time england play during the tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 haditha : " the horrible pictures are missing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not graphic enough ?
a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .
additionally , there 's a widespread feeling in the arab world that americans constantly commit crimes in iraq .
haditha , therefore , just gets added to the list . mathias bölinger interviewed horst müller -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .
-lrb- aug .
10 , 2004 -rrb- cartoons that shook the world read dw-world.de 's dossier on the scandal over publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammad in european media .
opinion : too much transparency is damaging along with relief over the release of two men held by their kidnappers for 99 days in iraq come speculations in german media about possible ransom payments .
that 's not a good idea , according to dw 's peter philipp .

a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .
additionally , there 's a widespread feeling in the arab world that americans constantly commit crimes in iraq .
haditha , therefore , just gets added to the list . mathias bölinger interviewed horst müller -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 opinion : a truly idiotic decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a perfect match : heine and handke by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent literary jury , german politicians are embarrassing themselves and damaging the fundaments of democratic culture , says dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . when peter handke received an honorary doctorate from the university of salzburg in 2003 , he promised he would withdraw from public life .
" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .
and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .
back then , idiots lived on the outskirts of the city-state .
their bad judgment in political matters made them outsiders .
they were not necessarily stupid , but definitely unreasonable .
you did n't want to have anything to do with them .
they were almost as bad as foreigners . what is happening in germany right now , however , is outrageous and idiotic - in almost every sense of the word .
an independent jury awarded germany 's most prestigious prize to one of the most famous - and most difficult - writers in the german language today .
the mayor of düsseldorf called the writer personally to congratulate him .
the writer said , " thank you very much , i 'm thrilled . "
but then the political cry-baby establishment got all huffed up because the writer - whose literary genius is not questioned - is a political " idiot . " for the media , it 's a field day . a comedy of situation ? bowing to the pressure of vociferous critics and he-said-she-said media reports , a member of the jury , a historian-turned-politician , publicly distanced himself from the problematic writer - but only post factum , after the prize announcement bearing his signature was made public and the general hullabaloo came over germany .
other politicians - encouraged by the tardy return of at least one prodigal son - turned to hyperbole and , all of a sudden , the writer started sounding like an epitome of evil , lucifer with an austrian accent who ascended directly from hell to spread hate and destruction . handke , at least , admitted he was an idiot .
but the german political establishment - and especially the local politicos who rarely , if ever , get a chance to speak to a national , let alone , international audience - should pause for a moment to reflect on what they have done .
by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent jury , they have seriously damaged not only their own reputation , but the very institution of the heinrich heine prize . whoever gets this award next should think twice before accepting it - unless things are made clear and the prize gets its name changed to " heinrich heine prize for political correctness . " let 's be serious .

a combination of drug-related crimes and the presence of warring gang lords in the region are expected to keep the troops busy . in addition , the future bundeswehr military camp in mazar-i-sharif , one of the biggest outside of germany , is expected to be an obvious target for insurgents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer is bolstering troops in afghanistan in an attempt to boost troop morale in the face of mounting violence , nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said tuesday that the success of the alliance 's stabilization mission in afghanistan was " vital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 opinion : a truly idiotic decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a perfect match : heine and handke by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent literary jury , german politicians are embarrassing themselves and damaging the fundaments of democratic culture , says dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . when peter handke received an honorary doctorate from the university of salzburg in 2003 , he promised he would withdraw from public life .
" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .
and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .
back then , idiots lived on the outskirts of the city-state .
their bad judgment in political matters made them outsiders .
they were not necessarily stupid , but definitely unreasonable .
you did n't want to have anything to do with them .
they were almost as bad as foreigners . what is happening in germany right now , however , is outrageous and idiotic - in almost every sense of the word .
an independent jury awarded germany 's most prestigious prize to one of the most famous - and most difficult - writers in the german language today .
the mayor of düsseldorf called the writer personally to congratulate him .
the writer said , " thank you very much , i 'm thrilled . "
but then the political cry-baby establishment got all huffed up because the writer - whose literary genius is not questioned - is a political " idiot . " for the media , it 's a field day . a comedy of situation ? bowing to the pressure of vociferous critics and he-said-she-said media reports , a member of the jury , a historian-turned-politician , publicly distanced himself from the problematic writer - but only post factum , after the prize announcement bearing his signature was made public and the general hullabaloo came over germany .
other politicians - encouraged by the tardy return of at least one prodigal son - turned to hyperbole and , all of a sudden , the writer started sounding like an epitome of evil , lucifer with an austrian accent who ascended directly from hell to spread hate and destruction . handke , at least , admitted he was an idiot .
but the german political establishment - and especially the local politicos who rarely , if ever , get a chance to speak to a national , let alone , international audience - should pause for a moment to reflect on what they have done .
by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent jury , they have seriously damaged not only their own reputation , but the very institution of the heinrich heine prize . whoever gets this award next should think twice before accepting it - unless things are made clear and the prize gets its name changed to " heinrich heine prize for political correctness . " let 's be serious .
who needs literary critics and philosophers - not to mention literature itself - if local politicos will always know better ? toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans divided over prize for pro-serb author handke the decision to award the city of düsseldorf 's prestigious heine prize to controversial austrian author peter handke - known for his pro-serbian stance during the balkan wars - has been met with criticism in germany .

suspicions of customs officials on a train travelling from the netherlands to switzerland were raised by a stuffed teddy bear which seemed a bit too heavy .
turned out , he was stuffed with 50,000 euros worth of cocaine . who 'd suspect a 15-year-old teenage girl with a big teddy bear to be a drug runner ? customs officials on a high-speed train heading to basel , switzerland from amsterdam were n't fooled by the ruse , especially after they picked up the 80-centimeter -lrb- 31.5-inch -rrb- bear during a check and found it strangely heavy .
on closer examination , they noticed that teddy had been operated on .
he had some stitches on his belly that were n't from the manufacturer . " a friend in amsterdam give me the teddy bear as a gift , " the girl told officials after repeated questions about her fuzzy friend 's origin . only when pressed further did she come clean .
turns out , teddy was n't there to provide companionship or act as a big soft pillow to snuggle up against ; teddy was running drugs - in his belly . there were 72 packets of cocaine that had been sewn into the big bear .
the powder 's street value was estimated at around 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , although the teenager did n't get near that amount to carry the stuff .
she told police she 'd been paid just under 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,576 -rrb- . german police handed the girl over to swiss authorities and now , according to a spokesperson , an investigation has begun into the individuals behind the failed smuggling attempt . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soft drugs with hard consequences cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in germany .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- . " we will take legal recourse against the states , " he said in an interview with the paper , adding that the hospitals were not able to make up for the lost income on their own . doctors originally began their strikes on march 16 with a series of one-day walkouts and on monday , they began another stage of their walk-out , promising strikes that would affect all but emergency services in 38 public hospitals in nine federal states this week . more than 12,500 doctors walked off the job yesterday demanding a 30 percent pay increase and better working conditions , including regular working hours , overtime pay and time during the working week to conduct research . the hospitals say the states should be required to provide compensation since they share the blame in not finding a way to end the prolonged strike . " completely absurd " the employers ' head negotiator , lower saxony finance minister hartmut möllring , has called the demands for compensation " completely absurd , " saying there is no " legal claim to successful wage negotiations . "
he added that such compensation would make little sense , since the states would be in effect paying themselves , since the hospitals in questions are public facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking doctors want better wages and working conditions " it would be like the right hand paying the left one , " möllring said . the two sides in the debate have failed to reach an agreement even after weeks of intense negotiations .
in mid-may , the marburger bund , a doctors ' union , broke off talks with state negotiators .
the union has promised to resume work next week , but to strike again during the following week , with the world cup in full swing . some have worried that medical care during the huge event , which is expected to bring 3.5 million visitors to germany , could be compromised . still , the chairman of the marburger bund , frank ulrich montgomery , said that despite the pumped-up rhetoric , he thinks chances are good that an agreement will be wrapped up soon , as long as the states " abandon their stonewalling at the expense of patients and hospitals and return to the negotiating table . "

" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .
and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .
back then , idiots lived on the outskirts of the city-state .
their bad judgment in political matters made them outsiders .

the mayor of düsseldorf called the writer personally to congratulate him .
the writer said , " thank you very much , i 'm thrilled . "
but then the political cry-baby establishment got all huffed up because the writer - whose literary genius is not questioned - is a political " idiot . " for the media , it 's a field day . a comedy of situation ? bowing to the pressure of vociferous critics and he-said-she-said media reports , a member of the jury , a historian-turned-politician , publicly distanced himself from the problematic writer - but only post factum , after the prize announcement bearing his signature was made public and the general hullabaloo came over germany .
other politicians - encouraged by the tardy return of at least one prodigal son - turned to hyperbole and , all of a sudden , the writer started sounding like an epitome of evil , lucifer with an austrian accent who ascended directly from hell to spread hate and destruction . handke , at least , admitted he was an idiot .
but the german political establishment - and especially the local politicos who rarely , if ever , get a chance to speak to a national , let alone , international audience - should pause for a moment to reflect on what they have done .
by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent jury , they have seriously damaged not only their own reputation , but the very institution of the heinrich heine prize . whoever gets this award next should think twice before accepting it - unless things are made clear and the prize gets its name changed to " heinrich heine prize for political correctness .

" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .
and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .
back then , idiots lived on the outskirts of the city-state .
their bad judgment in political matters made them outsiders .
they were not necessarily stupid , but definitely unreasonable .
you did n't want to have anything to do with them .
they were almost as bad as foreigners . what is happening in germany right now , however , is outrageous and idiotic - in almost every sense of the word .
an independent jury awarded germany 's most prestigious prize to one of the most famous - and most difficult - writers in the german language today .
the mayor of düsseldorf called the writer personally to congratulate him .
the writer said , " thank you very much , i 'm thrilled . "
but then the political cry-baby establishment got all huffed up because the writer - whose literary genius is not questioned - is a political " idiot . " for the media , it 's a field day . a comedy of situation ? bowing to the pressure of vociferous critics and he-said-she-said media reports , a member of the jury , a historian-turned-politician , publicly distanced himself from the problematic writer - but only post factum , after the prize announcement bearing his signature was made public and the general hullabaloo came over germany .
other politicians - encouraged by the tardy return of at least one prodigal son - turned to hyperbole and , all of a sudden , the writer started sounding like an epitome of evil , lucifer with an austrian accent who ascended directly from hell to spread hate and destruction . handke , at least , admitted he was an idiot .
but the german political establishment - and especially the local politicos who rarely , if ever , get a chance to speak to a national , let alone , international audience - should pause for a moment to reflect on what they have done .
by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent jury , they have seriously damaged not only their own reputation , but the very institution of the heinrich heine prize . whoever gets this award next should think twice before accepting it - unless things are made clear and the prize gets its name changed to " heinrich heine prize for political correctness .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- . " we will take legal recourse against the states , " he said in an interview with the paper , adding that the hospitals were not able to make up for the lost income on their own . doctors originally began their strikes on march 16 with a series of one-day walkouts and on monday , they began another stage of their walk-out , promising strikes that would affect all but emergency services in 38 public hospitals in nine federal states this week . more than 12,500 doctors walked off the job yesterday demanding a 30 percent pay increase and better working conditions , including regular working hours , overtime pay and time during the working week to conduct research . the hospitals say the states should be required to provide compensation since they share the blame in not finding a way to end the prolonged strike . " completely absurd " the employers ' head negotiator , lower saxony finance minister hartmut möllring , has called the demands for compensation " completely absurd , " saying there is no " legal claim to successful wage negotiations . "
he added that such compensation would make little sense , since the states would be in effect paying themselves , since the hospitals in questions are public facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking doctors want better wages and working conditions " it would be like the right hand paying the left one , " möllring said . the two sides in the debate have failed to reach an agreement even after weeks of intense negotiations .
in mid-may , the marburger bund , a doctors ' union , broke off talks with state negotiators .
the union has promised to resume work next week , but to strike again during the following week , with the world cup in full swing . some have worried that medical care during the huge event , which is expected to bring 3.5 million visitors to germany , could be compromised . still , the chairman of the marburger bund , frank ulrich montgomery , said that despite the pumped-up rhetoric , he thinks chances are good that an agreement will be wrapped up soon , as long as the states " abandon their stonewalling at the expense of patients and hospitals and return to the negotiating table . "
the union has indicated it is willing to compromise on some of its original demands . negotiator möllring , however , said the ball was now in the union 's court .

a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .
additionally , there 's a widespread feeling in the arab world that americans constantly commit crimes in iraq .
haditha , therefore , just gets added to the list . mathias bölinger interviewed horst müller -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .
-lrb- aug .
10 , 2004 -rrb- cartoons that shook the world read dw-world.de 's dossier on the scandal over publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammad in european media .
opinion : too much transparency is damaging along with relief over the release of two men held by their kidnappers for 99 days in iraq come speculations in german media about possible ransom payments .
that 's not a good idea , according to dw 's peter philipp .

she added that the child is largely protected in the womb from the virus due to the placenta . gingelmaier pointed out that rapid strides have been made in the west in preventing the hiv virus from being transmitted from mother to child .

she has to be treated with antiretroviral syrups for about four weeks until the doctors confirm that she 's in the clear and has n't been infected by her mother . in addition , müller is n't allowed to breastfeed .

the overwhelming majority of hiv-positive children are infected with the virus during or immediately after birth , the who says . success not repeated in africa but the admirable progress made in germany and the rest of the western world in combating aids is hardly being repeated in the rest of the world , particularly in africa . a lack of proper medical infrastructure , exorbitantly high prices for medicines and a lack of awareness about things like breastfeeding are some of the main reasons why negligible transmission rates from mother to child in germany are unlikely to be reached in africa in the foreseeable future , according to gingelmaier .

even if the woman does n't breastfeed it 's a problem , because you 're then exposed as being hiv-positive and have to deal with social stigmatization , " said gingelmaier . the un for its part has said that it simply lacks the funds for a concerted effort to battle the infection in africa . the un special commissioner for hiv / aids , stephen lewis , has said that the global health fund , into which all big industrialized countries pay money to combat health problems such as aids , tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries , is in dire need of more funds .

a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .
additionally , there 's a widespread feeling in the arab world that americans constantly commit crimes in iraq .
haditha , therefore , just gets added to the list . mathias bölinger interviewed horst müller -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .

that 's not a good idea , according to dw 's peter philipp .

the security officials allegedly stumbled on the suspects in internet chat rooms . citing an unnamed high-ranking security expert , berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported on wednesday that three german women who have converted to islam allegedly planned suicide bomb attacks in iraq and pakistan . however intelligence authorities apparently managed to prevent the women , aged between 20 and 40 , from traveling to iraq in recent weeks , the paper said .
one of the women comes from berlin , the other two from southern germany . suspected suicide bomber wanted to take child along another newspaper der berliner zeitung reported that the 40-year-old women from berlin also planned to involve her young child in the attack . " she apparently planned to draw her two-year-old child , who lives with her , along with her to death , " the paper quoted an unnamed police source in berlin .
one of the other women also apparently planned to take her one-year-old child with her to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of hamas suicide bombers with fake dynamite strapped around their chests the papers reported that the three were believed to have close contacts to the islamist scene in germany and adopted radical views through contacts in islamist chat rooms on the internet and under the influence of their islamist partners .
the berlin criminal police office is said to have stumbled on the three suspects after they voiced their plans in an islamist internet forum under a variety of code names . the 40-year-old berliner reportedly announced she planned to blow herself up in iraq and hoped to gain entry to paradise in this way , the berliner zeitung quoted an official from the berlin criminal police office as saying .
the youth office in berlin has apparently taken away the child of the 40-year-old berliner and sent her to a psychiatric clinic . no formal legal proceedings have been opened against the women as yet , but police have searched the apartment of the berliner . contacts to iraqi terrorist group ? though police remain tight-lipped about whether the women 's intentions to carry out suicide attacks on us troops in iraq and in pakistan were serious , media reports say the authorities are probing whether the women had contacts to the iraqi terrorist group ansar al islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police officers guard 31-year-old iraqi amin lokman mohammed ansar al islam - also known as ansar al sunna , a group that has carried out several attacks in iraq - is also active in germany .
in january this year a court in munich sentenced a ansar al islam member , lokman mohammed , to seven years in prison for recruiting young muslims with german passports for " jihad " or holy war in iraq as well as smuggling foreigners to germany . in december 2004 , police in berlin , stuttgart and augsburg arrested three suspected members of ansar al islam who are believed to have planned an attack on then iraqi prime minister ijad allawi during an official visit to berlin in the same year .
in addition , further cases against suspected ansar al islam members in germany are pending . not the first case reports of the three suspected female german suicide bombers are n't the first of their kind in western europe . last november , a 38-year-old belgian woman who converted to islam , muriel degauque , blew herself up in iraq , killing several iraqi policemen . der tagesspiegel quoted a security expert as saying the degauque case as well as the suspected german suicide bombers pointed to a growing danger of " home grown terrorism .

suspicions of customs officials on a train travelling from the netherlands to switzerland were raised by a stuffed teddy bear which seemed a bit too heavy .
turned out , he was stuffed with 50,000 euros worth of cocaine . who 'd suspect a 15-year-old teenage girl with a big teddy bear to be a drug runner ? customs officials on a high-speed train heading to basel , switzerland from amsterdam were n't fooled by the ruse , especially after they picked up the 80-centimeter -lrb- 31.5-inch -rrb- bear during a check and found it strangely heavy .
on closer examination , they noticed that teddy had been operated on .
he had some stitches on his belly that were n't from the manufacturer . " a friend in amsterdam give me the teddy bear as a gift , " the girl told officials after repeated questions about her fuzzy friend 's origin . only when pressed further did she come clean .
turns out , teddy was n't there to provide companionship or act as a big soft pillow to snuggle up against ; teddy was running drugs - in his belly . there were 72 packets of cocaine that had been sewn into the big bear .
the powder 's street value was estimated at around 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , although the teenager did n't get near that amount to carry the stuff .
she told police she 'd been paid just under 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,576 -rrb- . german police handed the girl over to swiss authorities and now , according to a spokesperson , an investigation has begun into the individuals behind the failed smuggling attempt . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soft drugs with hard consequences cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in germany .

but the city council , which gives the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,190 -rrb- , must approve their decision .
a vote has been scheduled for june 22 . " we 're not going to make the money available , " said one city council member . what 's the damage ? editorialists were divided on the likely decision to withhold the prize . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich heine " no one is going to dispute that this is an open affront against the jury , " wrote the left-wing fra n kfurter ru n dschau .
" but first of all , the jury was not united when doubts about the nomination arose .
and secondly , the damage for düsseldorf would be even bigger if it accepted honoring handke in the name of heine . " writers at berlin 's left-wing die tageszeitu n g saw things differently . " heine does n't deserve handke and handke does n't deserve the heine prize , " it wrote .
" but there 's no doubt that heine would have rejected the political control of a jury .
this form of censorship would be much worse than awarding the prize to the wrong person . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a milosevic supporter holds a picture of the late serbian leader during a memorial in belgrade the move to honor handke came just a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays because of a eulogy he delivered for milosevic , the former yugoslav president and alleged war criminal who died in march .
handke had described milosevic as " a man who defended his people . " while handke , who lives in france , refused to comment on the controversy regarding the decision to award him the prize , he answered his critics in an op-ed piece in the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g on tuesday . " nowhere in my work i have called slobodan milosevic ' one ' or ' the ' victim , " he wrote . un report : milosevic n ot poiso n ed while some milosevic supporters have claimed that he was poisoned in his prison cell in the hague , a new report published wednesday said that he had self-medicated himself and that experts could not agree whether surgery could have prevented his death .

the security officials allegedly stumbled on the suspects in internet chat rooms . citing an unnamed high-ranking security expert , berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported on wednesday that three german women who have converted to islam allegedly planned suicide bomb attacks in iraq and pakistan . however intelligence authorities apparently managed to prevent the women , aged between 20 and 40 , from traveling to iraq in recent weeks , the paper said .
one of the women comes from berlin , the other two from southern germany . suspected suicide bomber wanted to take child along another newspaper der berliner zeitung reported that the 40-year-old women from berlin also planned to involve her young child in the attack . " she apparently planned to draw her two-year-old child , who lives with her , along with her to death , " the paper quoted an unnamed police source in berlin .
one of the other women also apparently planned to take her one-year-old child with her to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of hamas suicide bombers with fake dynamite strapped around their chests the papers reported that the three were believed to have close contacts to the islamist scene in germany and adopted radical views through contacts in islamist chat rooms on the internet and under the influence of their islamist partners .
the berlin criminal police office is said to have stumbled on the three suspects after they voiced their plans in an islamist internet forum under a variety of code names . the 40-year-old berliner reportedly announced she planned to blow herself up in iraq and hoped to gain entry to paradise in this way , the berliner zeitung quoted an official from the berlin criminal police office as saying .
the youth office in berlin has apparently taken away the child of the 40-year-old berliner and sent her to a psychiatric clinic . no formal legal proceedings have been opened against the women as yet , but police have searched the apartment of the berliner . contacts to iraqi terrorist group ? though police remain tight-lipped about whether the women 's intentions to carry out suicide attacks on us troops in iraq and in pakistan were serious , media reports say the authorities are probing whether the women had contacts to the iraqi terrorist group ansar al islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police officers guard 31-year-old iraqi amin lokman mohammed ansar al islam - also known as ansar al sunna , a group that has carried out several attacks in iraq - is also active in germany .
in january this year a court in munich sentenced a ansar al islam member , lokman mohammed , to seven years in prison for recruiting young muslims with german passports for " jihad " or holy war in iraq as well as smuggling foreigners to germany . in december 2004 , police in berlin , stuttgart and augsburg arrested three suspected members of ansar al islam who are believed to have planned an attack on then iraqi prime minister ijad allawi during an official visit to berlin in the same year .
in addition , further cases against suspected ansar al islam members in germany are pending . not the first case reports of the three suspected female german suicide bombers are n't the first of their kind in western europe . last november , a 38-year-old belgian woman who converted to islam , muriel degauque , blew herself up in iraq , killing several iraqi policemen . der tagesspiegel quoted a security expert as saying the degauque case as well as the suspected german suicide bombers pointed to a growing danger of " home grown terrorism .

he agreed with police officers who said that a person running amok would not be the typical situation . " in order to avoid such incidents you 'd have to make sure that people did n't come together in large crowds , and that would mean doing away with all public viewing areas during the world cup - that 's out of the question , " schäuble said .
" this is not a problem that must be linked to the world cup . " schäuble added that all possible precautions were being taken to guarantee the safety of the people gathering at hundreds of public viewing areas across the country during the tournament .

we have the best of intentions - the rest is in god 's hands . " schäuble too was anxious to stress german hospitality after a spate of negative publicity over racist attacks . " germany is an open , peaceful and tolerant country , and we will show that during the world cup , " he said . preventing hooliganism the interior minister also gave an assurance that everything possible had been done in the run-up to the world cup to avoid any incidents involving hooligan violence .
he praised what he called the " excellent cooperation " with the police and state authorities from the participating nations . in britain , more than 3,000 known soccer hooligans have been called upon to hand over their passports to police to prevent them from traveling to the world cup in germany .
they will also be required to register at a police station each time england play during the tournament .

she added that the child is largely protected in the womb from the virus due to the placenta . gingelmaier pointed out that rapid strides have been made in the west in preventing the hiv virus from being transmitted from mother to child .

she has to be treated with antiretroviral syrups for about four weeks until the doctors confirm that she 's in the clear and has n't been infected by her mother . in addition , müller is n't allowed to breastfeed .
experts reckon that breastfeeding alone , depending on the duration , can increase the risk of hiv infection in a baby by about 45 percent .
almost every second hiv-positive child worldwide is infected through breastfeeding , said gingelmaier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are particularly susceptible to the hiv virus according to the world health organization , of the more than three million people who have died of aids worldwide , half a million have been children .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian fans celebrating without cigarettes in japan in 2002 but that 's not going to prevent people from lighting up as fifa , the world 's soccer body , has lifted a smoking ban put in place during the 2002 cup in south korea and japan .
according to news reports , the decision to allow smoking in stadiums was made after consultations with the german government and the event 's german organization committee . officials for the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , who had worked with fifa to introduce the smoking ban in the first place , said the no smoking announcements were unlikely to have the desired effect . " we know that voluntary tobacco-control agreements do n't work , " marta seoane , the spokeswoman for the who 's anti-smoking campaign , told german public broadcaster swr .
" smoking and tobacco bans have to be introduced to reduce consumption .
the point is to protect public health - the health of viewers in the stadiums and that of people - adults and children - who follow the games on television . " " completely incomprehensible " decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is banned in german train stations , but not restaurants the move to allow smoking in stadiums has outraged anti-smoking activists , who have long criticized the german government 's reluctance to back international initiatives to curb tobacco use , such as a global anti-smoking treaty proposed by the who and which took effect in 2003 .
eu officials have also criticized germany for failing to do more to limit smoking . " it 's completely incomprehensible why we do n't manage " to keep the tournament smoke-free , said dagmar schipanski , president of german cancer aid , adding that smoking will be banned again during the 2010 cup in south africa . others also accused fifa of sending a mixed message to fans by selling branded lighters and ashtrays . " the whole thing is really inconsistent , " sinead jones , the director of the international union against cancer 's global smoke free partnership , told reuters news service .
" they are saying to fans : ' do n't smoke , ' but on the other hand there will be absolutely no enforcement there .

while a majority of germans support smoking bans in restaurants and bars , so far , only a voluntary agreement to designate 50 percent of seats in 90 percent of restaurants as smoke-free by 2008 exists . " creating smoking and non-smoking areas only appear to solve the problem , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe , the president of the german medical association . according to germany 's federal center for health education , about 140,000 people in germany die each year as a result of smoking .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- . " we will take legal recourse against the states , " he said in an interview with the paper , adding that the hospitals were not able to make up for the lost income on their own . doctors originally began their strikes on march 16 with a series of one-day walkouts and on monday , they began another stage of their walk-out , promising strikes that would affect all but emergency services in 38 public hospitals in nine federal states this week . more than 12,500 doctors walked off the job yesterday demanding a 30 percent pay increase and better working conditions , including regular working hours , overtime pay and time during the working week to conduct research . the hospitals say the states should be required to provide compensation since they share the blame in not finding a way to end the prolonged strike . " completely absurd " the employers ' head negotiator , lower saxony finance minister hartmut möllring , has called the demands for compensation " completely absurd , " saying there is no " legal claim to successful wage negotiations . "
he added that such compensation would make little sense , since the states would be in effect paying themselves , since the hospitals in questions are public facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking doctors want better wages and working conditions " it would be like the right hand paying the left one , " möllring said . the two sides in the debate have failed to reach an agreement even after weeks of intense negotiations .
in mid-may , the marburger bund , a doctors ' union , broke off talks with state negotiators .
the union has promised to resume work next week , but to strike again during the following week , with the world cup in full swing . some have worried that medical care during the huge event , which is expected to bring 3.5 million visitors to germany , could be compromised . still , the chairman of the marburger bund , frank ulrich montgomery , said that despite the pumped-up rhetoric , he thinks chances are good that an agreement will be wrapped up soon , as long as the states " abandon their stonewalling at the expense of patients and hospitals and return to the negotiating table . "
the union has indicated it is willing to compromise on some of its original demands . negotiator möllring , however , said the ball was now in the union 's court .

she added that the child is largely protected in the womb from the virus due to the placenta . gingelmaier pointed out that rapid strides have been made in the west in preventing the hiv virus from being transmitted from mother to child .

a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .
additionally , there 's a widespread feeling in the arab world that americans constantly commit crimes in iraq .
haditha , therefore , just gets added to the list . mathias bölinger interviewed horst müller -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .
-lrb- aug .
10 , 2004 -rrb- cartoons that shook the world read dw-world.de 's dossier on the scandal over publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammad in european media .
opinion : too much transparency is damaging along with relief over the release of two men held by their kidnappers for 99 days in iraq come speculations in german media about possible ransom payments .
that 's not a good idea , according to dw 's peter philipp .

suspicions of customs officials on a train travelling from the netherlands to switzerland were raised by a stuffed teddy bear which seemed a bit too heavy .
turned out , he was stuffed with 50,000 euros worth of cocaine . who 'd suspect a 15-year-old teenage girl with a big teddy bear to be a drug runner ? customs officials on a high-speed train heading to basel , switzerland from amsterdam were n't fooled by the ruse , especially after they picked up the 80-centimeter -lrb- 31.5-inch -rrb- bear during a check and found it strangely heavy .
on closer examination , they noticed that teddy had been operated on .
he had some stitches on his belly that were n't from the manufacturer . " a friend in amsterdam give me the teddy bear as a gift , " the girl told officials after repeated questions about her fuzzy friend 's origin . only when pressed further did she come clean .
turns out , teddy was n't there to provide companionship or act as a big soft pillow to snuggle up against ; teddy was running drugs - in his belly . there were 72 packets of cocaine that had been sewn into the big bear .
the powder 's street value was estimated at around 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , although the teenager did n't get near that amount to carry the stuff .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- . " we will take legal recourse against the states , " he said in an interview with the paper , adding that the hospitals were not able to make up for the lost income on their own . doctors originally began their strikes on march 16 with a series of one-day walkouts and on monday , they began another stage of their walk-out , promising strikes that would affect all but emergency services in 38 public hospitals in nine federal states this week . more than 12,500 doctors walked off the job yesterday demanding a 30 percent pay increase and better working conditions , including regular working hours , overtime pay and time during the working week to conduct research . the hospitals say the states should be required to provide compensation since they share the blame in not finding a way to end the prolonged strike . " completely absurd " the employers ' head negotiator , lower saxony finance minister hartmut möllring , has called the demands for compensation " completely absurd , " saying there is no " legal claim to successful wage negotiations . "
he added that such compensation would make little sense , since the states would be in effect paying themselves , since the hospitals in questions are public facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking doctors want better wages and working conditions " it would be like the right hand paying the left one , " möllring said . the two sides in the debate have failed to reach an agreement even after weeks of intense negotiations .
in mid-may , the marburger bund , a doctors ' union , broke off talks with state negotiators .
the union has promised to resume work next week , but to strike again during the following week , with the world cup in full swing . some have worried that medical care during the huge event , which is expected to bring 3.5 million visitors to germany , could be compromised . still , the chairman of the marburger bund , frank ulrich montgomery , said that despite the pumped-up rhetoric , he thinks chances are good that an agreement will be wrapped up soon , as long as the states " abandon their stonewalling at the expense of patients and hospitals and return to the negotiating table . "
the union has indicated it is willing to compromise on some of its original demands . negotiator möllring , however , said the ball was now in the union 's court .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- . " we will take legal recourse against the states , " he said in an interview with the paper , adding that the hospitals were not able to make up for the lost income on their own . doctors originally began their strikes on march 16 with a series of one-day walkouts and on monday , they began another stage of their walk-out , promising strikes that would affect all but emergency services in 38 public hospitals in nine federal states this week . more than 12,500 doctors walked off the job yesterday demanding a 30 percent pay increase and better working conditions , including regular working hours , overtime pay and time during the working week to conduct research . the hospitals say the states should be required to provide compensation since they share the blame in not finding a way to end the prolonged strike . " completely absurd " the employers ' head negotiator , lower saxony finance minister hartmut möllring , has called the demands for compensation " completely absurd , " saying there is no " legal claim to successful wage negotiations . "
he added that such compensation would make little sense , since the states would be in effect paying themselves , since the hospitals in questions are public facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking doctors want better wages and working conditions " it would be like the right hand paying the left one , " möllring said . the two sides in the debate have failed to reach an agreement even after weeks of intense negotiations .
in mid-may , the marburger bund , a doctors ' union , broke off talks with state negotiators .
the union has promised to resume work next week , but to strike again during the following week , with the world cup in full swing . some have worried that medical care during the huge event , which is expected to bring 3.5 million visitors to germany , could be compromised . still , the chairman of the marburger bund , frank ulrich montgomery , said that despite the pumped-up rhetoric , he thinks chances are good that an agreement will be wrapped up soon , as long as the states " abandon their stonewalling at the expense of patients and hospitals and return to the negotiating table . "
the union has indicated it is willing to compromise on some of its original demands . negotiator möllring , however , said the ball was now in the union 's court . " those who walk away from the table are the ones who have to come back to it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de university doctors enter week-long strike doctors at 25 university clinics and 14 state hospitals across germany have expanded ongoing strikes , leading to the largest physician work-stoppage in the country 's history .

" i 'm really calm now , i was n't in the beginning , " said the baby 's mother , steffi müller -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
" my partner is also healthy , and so only i posed the risk , but my blood samples are really good .
and that 's why i 'm optimistic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has made strides in fighting the hiv virus müller , who 's been undergoing treatment at the munich clinic ever since she became pregnant , received a strong drug cocktail to suppress the hiv virus and the levels of the virus in her blood were monitored regularly .
in the 38th week of her pregnancy , two weeks before the expected birth , doctors performed a caesarean on müller using a technique that involves the lowest possible amount of blood to prevent the child from coming into contact with her mother 's infectious body fluids . new medicine drastically cuts transmission rate birth is the most crucial step for an infant whose mother carries the hiv virus , said andrea gingelmaier , a doctor at the munich clinic .
she added that the child is largely protected in the womb from the virus due to the placenta . gingelmaier pointed out that rapid strides have been made in the west in preventing the hiv virus from being transmitted from mother to child . " in 1994 , a big study in america found out that a natural transmission rate , which lies between 20 and 25 percent when it comes to hiv transmission from mother to child , could be pushed by down by two-thirds to under 8 percent simply through medicines , " said gingelmaier .
" and if you combine that with a caesarean , the transmission rate can be pushed down further to under 2 percent .
today we often use not just one medicine , but several different ones - a so-called combination therapy .
and with that we 're currently down to a hiv transmission rate of under 1 percent . " steffi müller 's daughter has gotten off to a good start in life .
she has to be treated with antiretroviral syrups for about four weeks until the doctors confirm that she 's in the clear and has n't been infected by her mother . in addition , müller is n't allowed to breastfeed .
experts reckon that breastfeeding alone , depending on the duration , can increase the risk of hiv infection in a baby by about 45 percent .
almost every second hiv-positive child worldwide is infected through breastfeeding , said gingelmaier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are particularly susceptible to the hiv virus according to the world health organization , of the more than three million people who have died of aids worldwide , half a million have been children .
the overwhelming majority of hiv-positive children are infected with the virus during or immediately after birth , the who says . success not repeated in africa but the admirable progress made in germany and the rest of the western world in combating aids is hardly being repeated in the rest of the world , particularly in africa . a lack of proper medical infrastructure , exorbitantly high prices for medicines and a lack of awareness about things like breastfeeding are some of the main reasons why negligible transmission rates from mother to child in germany are unlikely to be reached in africa in the foreseeable future , according to gingelmaier . " it 's a huge problem in these countries .
even if the woman does n't breastfeed it 's a problem , because you 're then exposed as being hiv-positive and have to deal with social stigmatization , " said gingelmaier . the un for its part has said that it simply lacks the funds for a concerted effort to battle the infection in africa . the un special commissioner for hiv / aids , stephen lewis , has said that the global health fund , into which all big industrialized countries pay money to combat health problems such as aids , tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries , is in dire need of more funds .
it lacks more than $ 3 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- for the years 2006 and 2007 , he said . maren hellwege-beck -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .

" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .
and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .
back then , idiots lived on the outskirts of the city-state .
their bad judgment in political matters made them outsiders .
they were not necessarily stupid , but definitely unreasonable .
you did n't want to have anything to do with them .
they were almost as bad as foreigners . what is happening in germany right now , however , is outrageous and idiotic - in almost every sense of the word .
an independent jury awarded germany 's most prestigious prize to one of the most famous - and most difficult - writers in the german language today .
the mayor of düsseldorf called the writer personally to congratulate him .
the writer said , " thank you very much , i 'm thrilled . "
but then the political cry-baby establishment got all huffed up because the writer - whose literary genius is not questioned - is a political " idiot . " for the media , it 's a field day . a comedy of situation ? bowing to the pressure of vociferous critics and he-said-she-said media reports , a member of the jury , a historian-turned-politician , publicly distanced himself from the problematic writer - but only post factum , after the prize announcement bearing his signature was made public and the general hullabaloo came over germany .
other politicians - encouraged by the tardy return of at least one prodigal son - turned to hyperbole and , all of a sudden , the writer started sounding like an epitome of evil , lucifer with an austrian accent who ascended directly from hell to spread hate and destruction . handke , at least , admitted he was an idiot .
but the german political establishment - and especially the local politicos who rarely , if ever , get a chance to speak to a national , let alone , international audience - should pause for a moment to reflect on what they have done .
by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent jury , they have seriously damaged not only their own reputation , but the very institution of the heinrich heine prize . whoever gets this award next should think twice before accepting it - unless things are made clear and the prize gets its name changed to " heinrich heine prize for political correctness . " let 's be serious .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 haditha : " the horrible pictures are missing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not graphic enough ?
a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .
additionally , there 's a widespread feeling in the arab world that americans constantly commit crimes in iraq .
haditha , therefore , just gets added to the list . mathias bölinger interviewed horst müller -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .
-lrb- aug .
10 , 2004 -rrb- cartoons that shook the world read dw-world.de 's dossier on the scandal over publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammad in european media .
opinion : too much transparency is damaging along with relief over the release of two men held by their kidnappers for 99 days in iraq come speculations in german media about possible ransom payments .
that 's not a good idea , according to dw 's peter philipp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 opinion : a truly idiotic decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a perfect match : heine and handke by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent literary jury , german politicians are embarrassing themselves and damaging the fundaments of democratic culture , says dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . when peter handke received an honorary doctorate from the university of salzburg in 2003 , he promised he would withdraw from public life .
" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .
and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .
back then , idiots lived on the outskirts of the city-state .
their bad judgment in political matters made them outsiders .
they were not necessarily stupid , but definitely unreasonable .
you did n't want to have anything to do with them .
they were almost as bad as foreigners . what is happening in germany right now , however , is outrageous and idiotic - in almost every sense of the word .
an independent jury awarded germany 's most prestigious prize to one of the most famous - and most difficult - writers in the german language today .
the mayor of düsseldorf called the writer personally to congratulate him .
the writer said , " thank you very much , i 'm thrilled . "
but then the political cry-baby establishment got all huffed up because the writer - whose literary genius is not questioned - is a political " idiot . " for the media , it 's a field day . a comedy of situation ? bowing to the pressure of vociferous critics and he-said-she-said media reports , a member of the jury , a historian-turned-politician , publicly distanced himself from the problematic writer - but only post factum , after the prize announcement bearing his signature was made public and the general hullabaloo came over germany .
other politicians - encouraged by the tardy return of at least one prodigal son - turned to hyperbole and , all of a sudden , the writer started sounding like an epitome of evil , lucifer with an austrian accent who ascended directly from hell to spread hate and destruction . handke , at least , admitted he was an idiot .
but the german political establishment - and especially the local politicos who rarely , if ever , get a chance to speak to a national , let alone , international audience - should pause for a moment to reflect on what they have done .
by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent jury , they have seriously damaged not only their own reputation , but the very institution of the heinrich heine prize . whoever gets this award next should think twice before accepting it - unless things are made clear and the prize gets its name changed to " heinrich heine prize for political correctness . " let 's be serious .

the security officials allegedly stumbled on the suspects in internet chat rooms . citing an unnamed high-ranking security expert , berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported on wednesday that three german women who have converted to islam allegedly planned suicide bomb attacks in iraq and pakistan . however intelligence authorities apparently managed to prevent the women , aged between 20 and 40 , from traveling to iraq in recent weeks , the paper said .
one of the women comes from berlin , the other two from southern germany . suspected suicide bomber wanted to take child along another newspaper der berliner zeitung reported that the 40-year-old women from berlin also planned to involve her young child in the attack . " she apparently planned to draw her two-year-old child , who lives with her , along with her to death , " the paper quoted an unnamed police source in berlin .
one of the other women also apparently planned to take her one-year-old child with her to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of hamas suicide bombers with fake dynamite strapped around their chests the papers reported that the three were believed to have close contacts to the islamist scene in germany and adopted radical views through contacts in islamist chat rooms on the internet and under the influence of their islamist partners .
the berlin criminal police office is said to have stumbled on the three suspects after they voiced their plans in an islamist internet forum under a variety of code names . the 40-year-old berliner reportedly announced she planned to blow herself up in iraq and hoped to gain entry to paradise in this way , the berliner zeitung quoted an official from the berlin criminal police office as saying .
the youth office in berlin has apparently taken away the child of the 40-year-old berliner and sent her to a psychiatric clinic . no formal legal proceedings have been opened against the women as yet , but police have searched the apartment of the berliner . contacts to iraqi terrorist group ? though police remain tight-lipped about whether the women 's intentions to carry out suicide attacks on us troops in iraq and in pakistan were serious , media reports say the authorities are probing whether the women had contacts to the iraqi terrorist group ansar al islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police officers guard 31-year-old iraqi amin lokman mohammed ansar al islam - also known as ansar al sunna , a group that has carried out several attacks in iraq - is also active in germany .
in january this year a court in munich sentenced a ansar al islam member , lokman mohammed , to seven years in prison for recruiting young muslims with german passports for " jihad " or holy war in iraq as well as smuggling foreigners to germany . in december 2004 , police in berlin , stuttgart and augsburg arrested three suspected members of ansar al islam who are believed to have planned an attack on then iraqi prime minister ijad allawi during an official visit to berlin in the same year .
in addition , further cases against suspected ansar al islam members in germany are pending . not the first case reports of the three suspected female german suicide bombers are n't the first of their kind in western europe . last november , a 38-year-old belgian woman who converted to islam , muriel degauque , blew herself up in iraq , killing several iraqi policemen . der tagesspiegel quoted a security expert as saying the degauque case as well as the suspected german suicide bombers pointed to a growing danger of " home grown terrorism .

" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .
and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .
back then , idiots lived on the outskirts of the city-state .
their bad judgment in political matters made them outsiders .
they were not necessarily stupid , but definitely unreasonable .
you did n't want to have anything to do with them .
they were almost as bad as foreigners . what is happening in germany right now , however , is outrageous and idiotic - in almost every sense of the word .
an independent jury awarded germany 's most prestigious prize to one of the most famous - and most difficult - writers in the german language today .
the mayor of düsseldorf called the writer personally to congratulate him .
the writer said , " thank you very much , i 'm thrilled . "
but then the political cry-baby establishment got all huffed up because the writer - whose literary genius is not questioned - is a political " idiot . " for the media , it 's a field day . a comedy of situation ? bowing to the pressure of vociferous critics and he-said-she-said media reports , a member of the jury , a historian-turned-politician , publicly distanced himself from the problematic writer - but only post factum , after the prize announcement bearing his signature was made public and the general hullabaloo came over germany .
other politicians - encouraged by the tardy return of at least one prodigal son - turned to hyperbole and , all of a sudden , the writer started sounding like an epitome of evil , lucifer with an austrian accent who ascended directly from hell to spread hate and destruction . handke , at least , admitted he was an idiot .
but the german political establishment - and especially the local politicos who rarely , if ever , get a chance to speak to a national , let alone , international audience - should pause for a moment to reflect on what they have done .
by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent jury , they have seriously damaged not only their own reputation , but the very institution of the heinrich heine prize . whoever gets this award next should think twice before accepting it - unless things are made clear and the prize gets its name changed to " heinrich heine prize for political correctness .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- .

" completely absurd " the employers ' head negotiator , lower saxony finance minister hartmut möllring , has called the demands for compensation " completely absurd , " saying there is no " legal claim to successful wage negotiations .

in mid-may , the marburger bund , a doctors ' union , broke off talks with state negotiators .
the union has promised to resume work next week , but to strike again during the following week , with the world cup in full swing . some have worried that medical care during the huge event , which is expected to bring 3.5 million visitors to germany , could be compromised . still , the chairman of the marburger bund , frank ulrich montgomery , said that despite the pumped-up rhetoric , he thinks chances are good that an agreement will be wrapped up soon , as long as the states " abandon their stonewalling at the expense of patients and hospitals and return to the negotiating table .

a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .
additionally , there 's a widespread feeling in the arab world that americans constantly commit crimes in iraq .
haditha , therefore , just gets added to the list . mathias bölinger interviewed horst müller -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 opinion : a truly idiotic decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a perfect match : heine and handke by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent literary jury , german politicians are embarrassing themselves and damaging the fundaments of democratic culture , says dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . when peter handke received an honorary doctorate from the university of salzburg in 2003 , he promised he would withdraw from public life .
" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .
and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .
back then , idiots lived on the outskirts of the city-state .
their bad judgment in political matters made them outsiders .
they were not necessarily stupid , but definitely unreasonable .
you did n't want to have anything to do with them .
they were almost as bad as foreigners . what is happening in germany right now , however , is outrageous and idiotic - in almost every sense of the word .
an independent jury awarded germany 's most prestigious prize to one of the most famous - and most difficult - writers in the german language today .
the mayor of düsseldorf called the writer personally to congratulate him .
the writer said , " thank you very much , i 'm thrilled . "
but then the political cry-baby establishment got all huffed up because the writer - whose literary genius is not questioned - is a political " idiot . " for the media , it 's a field day . a comedy of situation ? bowing to the pressure of vociferous critics and he-said-she-said media reports , a member of the jury , a historian-turned-politician , publicly distanced himself from the problematic writer - but only post factum , after the prize announcement bearing his signature was made public and the general hullabaloo came over germany .
other politicians - encouraged by the tardy return of at least one prodigal son - turned to hyperbole and , all of a sudden , the writer started sounding like an epitome of evil , lucifer with an austrian accent who ascended directly from hell to spread hate and destruction . handke , at least , admitted he was an idiot .
but the german political establishment - and especially the local politicos who rarely , if ever , get a chance to speak to a national , let alone , international audience - should pause for a moment to reflect on what they have done .
by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent jury , they have seriously damaged not only their own reputation , but the very institution of the heinrich heine prize . whoever gets this award next should think twice before accepting it - unless things are made clear and the prize gets its name changed to " heinrich heine prize for political correctness . " let 's be serious .
who needs literary critics and philosophers - not to mention literature itself - if local politicos will always know better ? toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans divided over prize for pro-serb author handke the decision to award the city of düsseldorf 's prestigious heine prize to controversial austrian author peter handke - known for his pro-serbian stance during the balkan wars - has been met with criticism in germany .

but the city council , which gives the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,190 -rrb- , must approve their decision .
a vote has been scheduled for june 22 . " we 're not going to make the money available , " said one city council member . what 's the damage ? editorialists were divided on the likely decision to withhold the prize . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich heine " no one is going to dispute that this is an open affront against the jury , " wrote the left-wing fra n kfurter ru n dschau .
" but first of all , the jury was not united when doubts about the nomination arose .
and secondly , the damage for düsseldorf would be even bigger if it accepted honoring handke in the name of heine . " writers at berlin 's left-wing die tageszeitu n g saw things differently . " heine does n't deserve handke and handke does n't deserve the heine prize , " it wrote .
" but there 's no doubt that heine would have rejected the political control of a jury .
this form of censorship would be much worse than awarding the prize to the wrong person . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a milosevic supporter holds a picture of the late serbian leader during a memorial in belgrade the move to honor handke came just a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays because of a eulogy he delivered for milosevic , the former yugoslav president and alleged war criminal who died in march .
handke had described milosevic as " a man who defended his people . " while handke , who lives in france , refused to comment on the controversy regarding the decision to award him the prize , he answered his critics in an op-ed piece in the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g on tuesday . " nowhere in my work i have called slobodan milosevic ' one ' or ' the ' victim , " he wrote . un report : milosevic n ot poiso n ed while some milosevic supporters have claimed that he was poisoned in his prison cell in the hague , a new report published wednesday said that he had self-medicated himself and that experts could not agree whether surgery could have prevented his death .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 haditha : " the horrible pictures are missing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not graphic enough ?
a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .
additionally , there 's a widespread feeling in the arab world that americans constantly commit crimes in iraq .
haditha , therefore , just gets added to the list . mathias bölinger interviewed horst müller -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .
-lrb- aug .
10 , 2004 -rrb- cartoons that shook the world read dw-world.de 's dossier on the scandal over publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammad in european media .
opinion : too much transparency is damaging along with relief over the release of two men held by their kidnappers for 99 days in iraq come speculations in german media about possible ransom payments .
that 's not a good idea , according to dw 's peter philipp .

he agreed with police officers who said that a person running amok would not be the typical situation . " in order to avoid such incidents you 'd have to make sure that people did n't come together in large crowds , and that would mean doing away with all public viewing areas during the world cup - that 's out of the question , " schäuble said .
" this is not a problem that must be linked to the world cup . " schäuble added that all possible precautions were being taken to guarantee the safety of the people gathering at hundreds of public viewing areas across the country during the tournament .
he also criticized demands to ban the sale of alcohol to partying soccer fans as unrealistic . anti-racism campaigns the head of the german organizing committee , franz beckenbauer , said that anti-racism campaigns would feature prominently during the sports event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has launched a hospitality campaign to help guests feel more welcome " here in germany we 've seen the need for additional service and friendliness campaigns to ensure that visitors will feel at home , " beckenbauer said .
" we 're poised to show the world that we 're friendly hosts .
we have the best of intentions - the rest is in god 's hands . " schäuble too was anxious to stress german hospitality after a spate of negative publicity over racist attacks . " germany is an open , peaceful and tolerant country , and we will show that during the world cup , " he said . preventing hooliganism the interior minister also gave an assurance that everything possible had been done in the run-up to the world cup to avoid any incidents involving hooligan violence .
he praised what he called the " excellent cooperation " with the police and state authorities from the participating nations . in britain , more than 3,000 known soccer hooligans have been called upon to hand over their passports to police to prevent them from traveling to the world cup in germany .
they will also be required to register at a police station each time england play during the tournament .

the security officials allegedly stumbled on the suspects in internet chat rooms . citing an unnamed high-ranking security expert , berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported on wednesday that three german women who have converted to islam allegedly planned suicide bomb attacks in iraq and pakistan . however intelligence authorities apparently managed to prevent the women , aged between 20 and 40 , from traveling to iraq in recent weeks , the paper said .
one of the women comes from berlin , the other two from southern germany . suspected suicide bomber wanted to take child along another newspaper der berliner zeitung reported that the 40-year-old women from berlin also planned to involve her young child in the attack . " she apparently planned to draw her two-year-old child , who lives with her , along with her to death , " the paper quoted an unnamed police source in berlin .

" i 'm really calm now , i was n't in the beginning , " said the baby 's mother , steffi müller -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
" my partner is also healthy , and so only i posed the risk , but my blood samples are really good .
and that 's why i 'm optimistic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has made strides in fighting the hiv virus müller , who 's been undergoing treatment at the munich clinic ever since she became pregnant , received a strong drug cocktail to suppress the hiv virus and the levels of the virus in her blood were monitored regularly .
in the 38th week of her pregnancy , two weeks before the expected birth , doctors performed a caesarean on müller using a technique that involves the lowest possible amount of blood to prevent the child from coming into contact with her mother 's infectious body fluids . new medicine drastically cuts transmission rate birth is the most crucial step for an infant whose mother carries the hiv virus , said andrea gingelmaier , a doctor at the munich clinic .
she added that the child is largely protected in the womb from the virus due to the placenta . gingelmaier pointed out that rapid strides have been made in the west in preventing the hiv virus from being transmitted from mother to child . " in 1994 , a big study in america found out that a natural transmission rate , which lies between 20 and 25 percent when it comes to hiv transmission from mother to child , could be pushed by down by two-thirds to under 8 percent simply through medicines , " said gingelmaier .
" and if you combine that with a caesarean , the transmission rate can be pushed down further to under 2 percent .
today we often use not just one medicine , but several different ones - a so-called combination therapy .
and with that we 're currently down to a hiv transmission rate of under 1 percent . " steffi müller 's daughter has gotten off to a good start in life .
she has to be treated with antiretroviral syrups for about four weeks until the doctors confirm that she 's in the clear and has n't been infected by her mother . in addition , müller is n't allowed to breastfeed .
experts reckon that breastfeeding alone , depending on the duration , can increase the risk of hiv infection in a baby by about 45 percent .
almost every second hiv-positive child worldwide is infected through breastfeeding , said gingelmaier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are particularly susceptible to the hiv virus according to the world health organization , of the more than three million people who have died of aids worldwide , half a million have been children .
the overwhelming majority of hiv-positive children are infected with the virus during or immediately after birth , the who says . success not repeated in africa but the admirable progress made in germany and the rest of the western world in combating aids is hardly being repeated in the rest of the world , particularly in africa . a lack of proper medical infrastructure , exorbitantly high prices for medicines and a lack of awareness about things like breastfeeding are some of the main reasons why negligible transmission rates from mother to child in germany are unlikely to be reached in africa in the foreseeable future , according to gingelmaier . " it 's a huge problem in these countries .
even if the woman does n't breastfeed it 's a problem , because you 're then exposed as being hiv-positive and have to deal with social stigmatization , " said gingelmaier . the un for its part has said that it simply lacks the funds for a concerted effort to battle the infection in africa . the un special commissioner for hiv / aids , stephen lewis , has said that the global health fund , into which all big industrialized countries pay money to combat health problems such as aids , tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries , is in dire need of more funds .
it lacks more than $ 3 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- for the years 2006 and 2007 , he said . maren hellwege-beck -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 haditha : " the horrible pictures are missing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not graphic enough ?
a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian fans celebrating without cigarettes in japan in 2002 but that 's not going to prevent people from lighting up as fifa , the world 's soccer body , has lifted a smoking ban put in place during the 2002 cup in south korea and japan .
according to news reports , the decision to allow smoking in stadiums was made after consultations with the german government and the event 's german organization committee . officials for the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , who had worked with fifa to introduce the smoking ban in the first place , said the no smoking announcements were unlikely to have the desired effect . " we know that voluntary tobacco-control agreements do n't work , " marta seoane , the spokeswoman for the who 's anti-smoking campaign , told german public broadcaster swr .
" smoking and tobacco bans have to be introduced to reduce consumption .
the point is to protect public health - the health of viewers in the stadiums and that of people - adults and children - who follow the games on television . " " completely incomprehensible " decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is banned in german train stations , but not restaurants the move to allow smoking in stadiums has outraged anti-smoking activists , who have long criticized the german government 's reluctance to back international initiatives to curb tobacco use , such as a global anti-smoking treaty proposed by the who and which took effect in 2003 .
eu officials have also criticized germany for failing to do more to limit smoking . " it 's completely incomprehensible why we do n't manage " to keep the tournament smoke-free , said dagmar schipanski , president of german cancer aid , adding that smoking will be banned again during the 2010 cup in south africa . others also accused fifa of sending a mixed message to fans by selling branded lighters and ashtrays . " the whole thing is really inconsistent , " sinead jones , the director of the international union against cancer 's global smoke free partnership , told reuters news service .
" they are saying to fans : ' do n't smoke , ' but on the other hand there will be absolutely no enforcement there . " germany still lags behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cigarette machines will only accept credit cards starting in 2007 to prevent teens from buying in germany , anti-smoking groups meanwhile used world no tobacco day to renew calls for more stringent controls .
while a majority of germans support smoking bans in restaurants and bars , so far , only a voluntary agreement to designate 50 percent of seats in 90 percent of restaurants as smoke-free by 2008 exists . " creating smoking and non-smoking areas only appear to solve the problem , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe , the president of the german medical association . according to germany 's federal center for health education , about 140,000 people in germany die each year as a result of smoking .

the security officials allegedly stumbled on the suspects in internet chat rooms . citing an unnamed high-ranking security expert , berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported on wednesday that three german women who have converted to islam allegedly planned suicide bomb attacks in iraq and pakistan . however intelligence authorities apparently managed to prevent the women , aged between 20 and 40 , from traveling to iraq in recent weeks , the paper said .
one of the women comes from berlin , the other two from southern germany . suspected suicide bomber wanted to take child along another newspaper der berliner zeitung reported that the 40-year-old women from berlin also planned to involve her young child in the attack . " she apparently planned to draw her two-year-old child , who lives with her , along with her to death , " the paper quoted an unnamed police source in berlin .
one of the other women also apparently planned to take her one-year-old child with her to iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of hamas suicide bombers with fake dynamite strapped around their chests the papers reported that the three were believed to have close contacts to the islamist scene in germany and adopted radical views through contacts in islamist chat rooms on the internet and under the influence of their islamist partners .
the berlin criminal police office is said to have stumbled on the three suspects after they voiced their plans in an islamist internet forum under a variety of code names . the 40-year-old berliner reportedly announced she planned to blow herself up in iraq and hoped to gain entry to paradise in this way , the berliner zeitung quoted an official from the berlin criminal police office as saying .
the youth office in berlin has apparently taken away the child of the 40-year-old berliner and sent her to a psychiatric clinic . no formal legal proceedings have been opened against the women as yet , but police have searched the apartment of the berliner . contacts to iraqi terrorist group ? though police remain tight-lipped about whether the women 's intentions to carry out suicide attacks on us troops in iraq and in pakistan were serious , media reports say the authorities are probing whether the women had contacts to the iraqi terrorist group ansar al islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police officers guard 31-year-old iraqi amin lokman mohammed ansar al islam - also known as ansar al sunna , a group that has carried out several attacks in iraq - is also active in germany .
in january this year a court in munich sentenced a ansar al islam member , lokman mohammed , to seven years in prison for recruiting young muslims with german passports for " jihad " or holy war in iraq as well as smuggling foreigners to germany . in december 2004 , police in berlin , stuttgart and augsburg arrested three suspected members of ansar al islam who are believed to have planned an attack on then iraqi prime minister ijad allawi during an official visit to berlin in the same year .
in addition , further cases against suspected ansar al islam members in germany are pending . not the first case reports of the three suspected female german suicide bombers are n't the first of their kind in western europe . last november , a 38-year-old belgian woman who converted to islam , muriel degauque , blew herself up in iraq , killing several iraqi policemen . der tagesspiegel quoted a security expert as saying the degauque case as well as the suspected german suicide bombers pointed to a growing danger of " home grown terrorism .

the writer said , " thank you very much , i 'm thrilled . "
but then the political cry-baby establishment got all huffed up because the writer - whose literary genius is not questioned - is a political " idiot . " for the media , it 's a field day . a comedy of situation ? bowing to the pressure of vociferous critics and he-said-she-said media reports , a member of the jury , a historian-turned-politician , publicly distanced himself from the problematic writer - but only post factum , after the prize announcement bearing his signature was made public and the general hullabaloo came over germany .
other politicians - encouraged by the tardy return of at least one prodigal son - turned to hyperbole and , all of a sudden , the writer started sounding like an epitome of evil , lucifer with an austrian accent who ascended directly from hell to spread hate and destruction . handke , at least , admitted he was an idiot .
but the german political establishment - and especially the local politicos who rarely , if ever , get a chance to speak to a national , let alone , international audience - should pause for a moment to reflect on what they have done .
by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent jury , they have seriously damaged not only their own reputation , but the very institution of the heinrich heine prize . whoever gets this award next should think twice before accepting it - unless things are made clear and the prize gets its name changed to " heinrich heine prize for political correctness . " let 's be serious .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 haditha : " the horrible pictures are missing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not graphic enough ?
a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .
additionally , there 's a widespread feeling in the arab world that americans constantly commit crimes in iraq .
haditha , therefore , just gets added to the list . mathias bölinger interviewed horst müller -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .
-lrb- aug .
10 , 2004 -rrb- cartoons that shook the world read dw-world.de 's dossier on the scandal over publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammad in european media .
opinion : too much transparency is damaging along with relief over the release of two men held by their kidnappers for 99 days in iraq come speculations in german media about possible ransom payments .
that 's not a good idea , according to dw 's peter philipp .
-lrb- may 3 , 2006 -rrb- feedback do you agree with müller about the importance of pictures to grab public attention ?

the point is to protect public health - the health of viewers in the stadiums and that of people - adults and children - who follow the games on television . " " completely incomprehensible " decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is banned in german train stations , but not restaurants the move to allow smoking in stadiums has outraged anti-smoking activists , who have long criticized the german government 's reluctance to back international initiatives to curb tobacco use , such as a global anti-smoking treaty proposed by the who and which took effect in 2003 .
eu officials have also criticized germany for failing to do more to limit smoking . " it 's completely incomprehensible why we do n't manage " to keep the tournament smoke-free , said dagmar schipanski , president of german cancer aid , adding that smoking will be banned again during the 2010 cup in south africa . others also accused fifa of sending a mixed message to fans by selling branded lighters and ashtrays . " the whole thing is really inconsistent , " sinead jones , the director of the international union against cancer 's global smoke free partnership , told reuters news service .
" they are saying to fans : ' do n't smoke , ' but on the other hand there will be absolutely no enforcement there . " germany still lags behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cigarette machines will only accept credit cards starting in 2007 to prevent teens from buying in germany , anti-smoking groups meanwhile used world no tobacco day to renew calls for more stringent controls .
while a majority of germans support smoking bans in restaurants and bars , so far , only a voluntary agreement to designate 50 percent of seats in 90 percent of restaurants as smoke-free by 2008 exists . " creating smoking and non-smoking areas only appear to solve the problem , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe , the president of the german medical association . according to germany 's federal center for health education , about 140,000 people in germany die each year as a result of smoking .

" i 'm really calm now , i was n't in the beginning , " said the baby 's mother , steffi müller -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
" my partner is also healthy , and so only i posed the risk , but my blood samples are really good .
and that 's why i 'm optimistic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has made strides in fighting the hiv virus müller , who 's been undergoing treatment at the munich clinic ever since she became pregnant , received a strong drug cocktail to suppress the hiv virus and the levels of the virus in her blood were monitored regularly .
in the 38th week of her pregnancy , two weeks before the expected birth , doctors performed a caesarean on müller using a technique that involves the lowest possible amount of blood to prevent the child from coming into contact with her mother 's infectious body fluids . new medicine drastically cuts transmission rate birth is the most crucial step for an infant whose mother carries the hiv virus , said andrea gingelmaier , a doctor at the munich clinic .
she added that the child is largely protected in the womb from the virus due to the placenta . gingelmaier pointed out that rapid strides have been made in the west in preventing the hiv virus from being transmitted from mother to child . " in 1994 , a big study in america found out that a natural transmission rate , which lies between 20 and 25 percent when it comes to hiv transmission from mother to child , could be pushed by down by two-thirds to under 8 percent simply through medicines , " said gingelmaier .
" and if you combine that with a caesarean , the transmission rate can be pushed down further to under 2 percent .
today we often use not just one medicine , but several different ones - a so-called combination therapy .
and with that we 're currently down to a hiv transmission rate of under 1 percent . " steffi müller 's daughter has gotten off to a good start in life .
she has to be treated with antiretroviral syrups for about four weeks until the doctors confirm that she 's in the clear and has n't been infected by her mother . in addition , müller is n't allowed to breastfeed .
experts reckon that breastfeeding alone , depending on the duration , can increase the risk of hiv infection in a baby by about 45 percent .
almost every second hiv-positive child worldwide is infected through breastfeeding , said gingelmaier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are particularly susceptible to the hiv virus according to the world health organization , of the more than three million people who have died of aids worldwide , half a million have been children .
the overwhelming majority of hiv-positive children are infected with the virus during or immediately after birth , the who says . success not repeated in africa but the admirable progress made in germany and the rest of the western world in combating aids is hardly being repeated in the rest of the world , particularly in africa . a lack of proper medical infrastructure , exorbitantly high prices for medicines and a lack of awareness about things like breastfeeding are some of the main reasons why negligible transmission rates from mother to child in germany are unlikely to be reached in africa in the foreseeable future , according to gingelmaier . " it 's a huge problem in these countries .
even if the woman does n't breastfeed it 's a problem , because you 're then exposed as being hiv-positive and have to deal with social stigmatization , " said gingelmaier . the un for its part has said that it simply lacks the funds for a concerted effort to battle the infection in africa . the un special commissioner for hiv / aids , stephen lewis , has said that the global health fund , into which all big industrialized countries pay money to combat health problems such as aids , tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries , is in dire need of more funds .
it lacks more than $ 3 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- for the years 2006 and 2007 , he said . maren hellwege-beck -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- . " we will take legal recourse against the states , " he said in an interview with the paper , adding that the hospitals were not able to make up for the lost income on their own . doctors originally began their strikes on march 16 with a series of one-day walkouts and on monday , they began another stage of their walk-out , promising strikes that would affect all but emergency services in 38 public hospitals in nine federal states this week . more than 12,500 doctors walked off the job yesterday demanding a 30 percent pay increase and better working conditions , including regular working hours , overtime pay and time during the working week to conduct research . the hospitals say the states should be required to provide compensation since they share the blame in not finding a way to end the prolonged strike . " completely absurd " the employers ' head negotiator , lower saxony finance minister hartmut möllring , has called the demands for compensation " completely absurd , " saying there is no " legal claim to successful wage negotiations . "
he added that such compensation would make little sense , since the states would be in effect paying themselves , since the hospitals in questions are public facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking doctors want better wages and working conditions " it would be like the right hand paying the left one , " möllring said . the two sides in the debate have failed to reach an agreement even after weeks of intense negotiations .
in mid-may , the marburger bund , a doctors ' union , broke off talks with state negotiators .
the union has promised to resume work next week , but to strike again during the following week , with the world cup in full swing . some have worried that medical care during the huge event , which is expected to bring 3.5 million visitors to germany , could be compromised . still , the chairman of the marburger bund , frank ulrich montgomery , said that despite the pumped-up rhetoric , he thinks chances are good that an agreement will be wrapped up soon , as long as the states " abandon their stonewalling at the expense of patients and hospitals and return to the negotiating table . "
the union has indicated it is willing to compromise on some of its original demands . negotiator möllring , however , said the ball was now in the union 's court .

suspicions of customs officials on a train travelling from the netherlands to switzerland were raised by a stuffed teddy bear which seemed a bit too heavy .
turned out , he was stuffed with 50,000 euros worth of cocaine . who 'd suspect a 15-year-old teenage girl with a big teddy bear to be a drug runner ? customs officials on a high-speed train heading to basel , switzerland from amsterdam were n't fooled by the ruse , especially after they picked up the 80-centimeter -lrb- 31.5-inch -rrb- bear during a check and found it strangely heavy .
on closer examination , they noticed that teddy had been operated on .
he had some stitches on his belly that were n't from the manufacturer . " a friend in amsterdam give me the teddy bear as a gift , " the girl told officials after repeated questions about her fuzzy friend 's origin . only when pressed further did she come clean .
turns out , teddy was n't there to provide companionship or act as a big soft pillow to snuggle up against ; teddy was running drugs - in his belly . there were 72 packets of cocaine that had been sewn into the big bear .
the powder 's street value was estimated at around 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,000 -rrb- , although the teenager did n't get near that amount to carry the stuff .
she told police she 'd been paid just under 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,576 -rrb- . german police handed the girl over to swiss authorities and now , according to a spokesperson , an investigation has begun into the individuals behind the failed smuggling attempt . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soft drugs with hard consequences cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in germany .

" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .

he is also not very good about keeping promises .

the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .

other politicians - encouraged by the tardy return of at least one prodigal son - turned to hyperbole and , all of a sudden , the writer started sounding like an epitome of evil , lucifer with an austrian accent who ascended directly from hell to spread hate and destruction . handke , at least , admitted he was an idiot .

according to news reports , the decision to allow smoking in stadiums was made after consultations with the german government and the event 's german organization committee . officials for the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , who had worked with fifa to introduce the smoking ban in the first place , said the no smoking announcements were unlikely to have the desired effect . " we know that voluntary tobacco-control agreements do n't work , " marta seoane , the spokeswoman for the who 's anti-smoking campaign , told german public broadcaster swr .
" smoking and tobacco bans have to be introduced to reduce consumption .
the point is to protect public health - the health of viewers in the stadiums and that of people - adults and children - who follow the games on television . " " completely incomprehensible " decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is banned in german train stations , but not restaurants the move to allow smoking in stadiums has outraged anti-smoking activists , who have long criticized the german government 's reluctance to back international initiatives to curb tobacco use , such as a global anti-smoking treaty proposed by the who and which took effect in 2003 .
eu officials have also criticized germany for failing to do more to limit smoking . " it 's completely incomprehensible why we do n't manage " to keep the tournament smoke-free , said dagmar schipanski , president of german cancer aid , adding that smoking will be banned again during the 2010 cup in south africa . others also accused fifa of sending a mixed message to fans by selling branded lighters and ashtrays . " the whole thing is really inconsistent , " sinead jones , the director of the international union against cancer 's global smoke free partnership , told reuters news service .
" they are saying to fans : ' do n't smoke , ' but on the other hand there will be absolutely no enforcement there . " germany still lags behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cigarette machines will only accept credit cards starting in 2007 to prevent teens from buying in germany , anti-smoking groups meanwhile used world no tobacco day to renew calls for more stringent controls .
while a majority of germans support smoking bans in restaurants and bars , so far , only a voluntary agreement to designate 50 percent of seats in 90 percent of restaurants as smoke-free by 2008 exists . " creating smoking and non-smoking areas only appear to solve the problem , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe , the president of the german medical association . according to germany 's federal center for health education , about 140,000 people in germany die each year as a result of smoking .

but the city council , which gives the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,190 -rrb- , must approve their decision .
a vote has been scheduled for june 22 . " we 're not going to make the money available , " said one city council member . what 's the damage ? editorialists were divided on the likely decision to withhold the prize . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich heine " no one is going to dispute that this is an open affront against the jury , " wrote the left-wing fra n kfurter ru n dschau .
" but first of all , the jury was not united when doubts about the nomination arose .
and secondly , the damage for düsseldorf would be even bigger if it accepted honoring handke in the name of heine . " writers at berlin 's left-wing die tageszeitu n g saw things differently . " heine does n't deserve handke and handke does n't deserve the heine prize , " it wrote .
" but there 's no doubt that heine would have rejected the political control of a jury .
this form of censorship would be much worse than awarding the prize to the wrong person . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a milosevic supporter holds a picture of the late serbian leader during a memorial in belgrade the move to honor handke came just a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays because of a eulogy he delivered for milosevic , the former yugoslav president and alleged war criminal who died in march .
handke had described milosevic as " a man who defended his people .

but the city council , which gives the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,190 -rrb- , must approve their decision .
a vote has been scheduled for june 22 . " we 're not going to make the money available , " said one city council member . what 's the damage ? editorialists were divided on the likely decision to withhold the prize . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich heine " no one is going to dispute that this is an open affront against the jury , " wrote the left-wing fra n kfurter ru n dschau .
" but first of all , the jury was not united when doubts about the nomination arose .
and secondly , the damage for düsseldorf would be even bigger if it accepted honoring handke in the name of heine . " writers at berlin 's left-wing die tageszeitu n g saw things differently . " heine does n't deserve handke and handke does n't deserve the heine prize , " it wrote .
" but there 's no doubt that heine would have rejected the political control of a jury .
this form of censorship would be much worse than awarding the prize to the wrong person . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a milosevic supporter holds a picture of the late serbian leader during a memorial in belgrade the move to honor handke came just a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays because of a eulogy he delivered for milosevic , the former yugoslav president and alleged war criminal who died in march .
handke had described milosevic as " a man who defended his people . " while handke , who lives in france , refused to comment on the controversy regarding the decision to award him the prize , he answered his critics in an op-ed piece in the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g on tuesday .

but the city council , which gives the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,190 -rrb- , must approve their decision .

" but there 's no doubt that heine would have rejected the political control of a jury .
this form of censorship would be much worse than awarding the prize to the wrong person .

a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .
additionally , there 's a widespread feeling in the arab world that americans constantly commit crimes in iraq .
haditha , therefore , just gets added to the list . mathias bölinger interviewed horst müller -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- . " we will take legal recourse against the states , " he said in an interview with the paper , adding that the hospitals were not able to make up for the lost income on their own . doctors originally began their strikes on march 16 with a series of one-day walkouts and on monday , they began another stage of their walk-out , promising strikes that would affect all but emergency services in 38 public hospitals in nine federal states this week . more than 12,500 doctors walked off the job yesterday demanding a 30 percent pay increase and better working conditions , including regular working hours , overtime pay and time during the working week to conduct research . the hospitals say the states should be required to provide compensation since they share the blame in not finding a way to end the prolonged strike . " completely absurd " the employers ' head negotiator , lower saxony finance minister hartmut möllring , has called the demands for compensation " completely absurd , " saying there is no " legal claim to successful wage negotiations . "
he added that such compensation would make little sense , since the states would be in effect paying themselves , since the hospitals in questions are public facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking doctors want better wages and working conditions " it would be like the right hand paying the left one , " möllring said . the two sides in the debate have failed to reach an agreement even after weeks of intense negotiations .
in mid-may , the marburger bund , a doctors ' union , broke off talks with state negotiators .
the union has promised to resume work next week , but to strike again during the following week , with the world cup in full swing . some have worried that medical care during the huge event , which is expected to bring 3.5 million visitors to germany , could be compromised . still , the chairman of the marburger bund , frank ulrich montgomery , said that despite the pumped-up rhetoric , he thinks chances are good that an agreement will be wrapped up soon , as long as the states " abandon their stonewalling at the expense of patients and hospitals and return to the negotiating table . "

" i 'm really calm now , i was n't in the beginning , " said the baby 's mother , steffi müller -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
" my partner is also healthy , and so only i posed the risk , but my blood samples are really good .
and that 's why i 'm optimistic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has made strides in fighting the hiv virus müller , who 's been undergoing treatment at the munich clinic ever since she became pregnant , received a strong drug cocktail to suppress the hiv virus and the levels of the virus in her blood were monitored regularly .
in the 38th week of her pregnancy , two weeks before the expected birth , doctors performed a caesarean on müller using a technique that involves the lowest possible amount of blood to prevent the child from coming into contact with her mother 's infectious body fluids . new medicine drastically cuts transmission rate birth is the most crucial step for an infant whose mother carries the hiv virus , said andrea gingelmaier , a doctor at the munich clinic .
she added that the child is largely protected in the womb from the virus due to the placenta . gingelmaier pointed out that rapid strides have been made in the west in preventing the hiv virus from being transmitted from mother to child . " in 1994 , a big study in america found out that a natural transmission rate , which lies between 20 and 25 percent when it comes to hiv transmission from mother to child , could be pushed by down by two-thirds to under 8 percent simply through medicines , " said gingelmaier .
" and if you combine that with a caesarean , the transmission rate can be pushed down further to under 2 percent .
today we often use not just one medicine , but several different ones - a so-called combination therapy .
and with that we 're currently down to a hiv transmission rate of under 1 percent . " steffi müller 's daughter has gotten off to a good start in life .
she has to be treated with antiretroviral syrups for about four weeks until the doctors confirm that she 's in the clear and has n't been infected by her mother . in addition , müller is n't allowed to breastfeed .
experts reckon that breastfeeding alone , depending on the duration , can increase the risk of hiv infection in a baby by about 45 percent .
almost every second hiv-positive child worldwide is infected through breastfeeding , said gingelmaier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are particularly susceptible to the hiv virus according to the world health organization , of the more than three million people who have died of aids worldwide , half a million have been children .
the overwhelming majority of hiv-positive children are infected with the virus during or immediately after birth , the who says . success not repeated in africa but the admirable progress made in germany and the rest of the western world in combating aids is hardly being repeated in the rest of the world , particularly in africa . a lack of proper medical infrastructure , exorbitantly high prices for medicines and a lack of awareness about things like breastfeeding are some of the main reasons why negligible transmission rates from mother to child in germany are unlikely to be reached in africa in the foreseeable future , according to gingelmaier . " it 's a huge problem in these countries .
even if the woman does n't breastfeed it 's a problem , because you 're then exposed as being hiv-positive and have to deal with social stigmatization , " said gingelmaier . the un for its part has said that it simply lacks the funds for a concerted effort to battle the infection in africa . the un special commissioner for hiv / aids , stephen lewis , has said that the global health fund , into which all big industrialized countries pay money to combat health problems such as aids , tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries , is in dire need of more funds .
it lacks more than $ 3 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- for the years 2006 and 2007 , he said . maren hellwege-beck -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .

" and if you combine that with a caesarean , the transmission rate can be pushed down further to under 2 percent .
today we often use not just one medicine , but several different ones - a so-called combination therapy .

she has to be treated with antiretroviral syrups for about four weeks until the doctors confirm that she 's in the clear and has n't been infected by her mother . in addition , müller is n't allowed to breastfeed .

" it 's a huge problem in these countries .
even if the woman does n't breastfeed it 's a problem , because you 're then exposed as being hiv-positive and have to deal with social stigmatization , " said gingelmaier . the un for its part has said that it simply lacks the funds for a concerted effort to battle the infection in africa . the un special commissioner for hiv / aids , stephen lewis , has said that the global health fund , into which all big industrialized countries pay money to combat health problems such as aids , tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries , is in dire need of more funds .

a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .
additionally , there 's a widespread feeling in the arab world that americans constantly commit crimes in iraq .
haditha , therefore , just gets added to the list . mathias bölinger interviewed horst müller -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .
-lrb- aug .
10 , 2004 -rrb- cartoons that shook the world read dw-world.de 's dossier on the scandal over publication of cartoons of the prophet mohammad in european media .
opinion : too much transparency is damaging along with relief over the release of two men held by their kidnappers for 99 days in iraq come speculations in german media about possible ransom payments .
that 's not a good idea , according to dw 's peter philipp .

" completely absurd " the employers ' head negotiator , lower saxony finance minister hartmut möllring , has called the demands for compensation " completely absurd , " saying there is no " legal claim to successful wage negotiations .

in mid-may , the marburger bund , a doctors ' union , broke off talks with state negotiators .
the union has promised to resume work next week , but to strike again during the following week , with the world cup in full swing . some have worried that medical care during the huge event , which is expected to bring 3.5 million visitors to germany , could be compromised . still , the chairman of the marburger bund , frank ulrich montgomery , said that despite the pumped-up rhetoric , he thinks chances are good that an agreement will be wrapped up soon , as long as the states " abandon their stonewalling at the expense of patients and hospitals and return to the negotiating table .

" i 'm really calm now , i was n't in the beginning , " said the baby 's mother , steffi müller -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
" my partner is also healthy , and so only i posed the risk , but my blood samples are really good .
and that 's why i 'm optimistic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has made strides in fighting the hiv virus müller , who 's been undergoing treatment at the munich clinic ever since she became pregnant , received a strong drug cocktail to suppress the hiv virus and the levels of the virus in her blood were monitored regularly .
in the 38th week of her pregnancy , two weeks before the expected birth , doctors performed a caesarean on müller using a technique that involves the lowest possible amount of blood to prevent the child from coming into contact with her mother 's infectious body fluids . new medicine drastically cuts transmission rate birth is the most crucial step for an infant whose mother carries the hiv virus , said andrea gingelmaier , a doctor at the munich clinic .
she added that the child is largely protected in the womb from the virus due to the placenta . gingelmaier pointed out that rapid strides have been made in the west in preventing the hiv virus from being transmitted from mother to child . " in 1994 , a big study in america found out that a natural transmission rate , which lies between 20 and 25 percent when it comes to hiv transmission from mother to child , could be pushed by down by two-thirds to under 8 percent simply through medicines , " said gingelmaier .
" and if you combine that with a caesarean , the transmission rate can be pushed down further to under 2 percent .
today we often use not just one medicine , but several different ones - a so-called combination therapy .
and with that we 're currently down to a hiv transmission rate of under 1 percent . " steffi müller 's daughter has gotten off to a good start in life .
she has to be treated with antiretroviral syrups for about four weeks until the doctors confirm that she 's in the clear and has n't been infected by her mother . in addition , müller is n't allowed to breastfeed .
experts reckon that breastfeeding alone , depending on the duration , can increase the risk of hiv infection in a baby by about 45 percent .
almost every second hiv-positive child worldwide is infected through breastfeeding , said gingelmaier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are particularly susceptible to the hiv virus according to the world health organization , of the more than three million people who have died of aids worldwide , half a million have been children .
the overwhelming majority of hiv-positive children are infected with the virus during or immediately after birth , the who says . success not repeated in africa but the admirable progress made in germany and the rest of the western world in combating aids is hardly being repeated in the rest of the world , particularly in africa . a lack of proper medical infrastructure , exorbitantly high prices for medicines and a lack of awareness about things like breastfeeding are some of the main reasons why negligible transmission rates from mother to child in germany are unlikely to be reached in africa in the foreseeable future , according to gingelmaier . " it 's a huge problem in these countries .
even if the woman does n't breastfeed it 's a problem , because you 're then exposed as being hiv-positive and have to deal with social stigmatization , " said gingelmaier . the un for its part has said that it simply lacks the funds for a concerted effort to battle the infection in africa . the un special commissioner for hiv / aids , stephen lewis , has said that the global health fund , into which all big industrialized countries pay money to combat health problems such as aids , tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries , is in dire need of more funds .
it lacks more than $ 3 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- for the years 2006 and 2007 , he said . maren hellwege-beck -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .

he agreed with police officers who said that a person running amok would not be the typical situation . " in order to avoid such incidents you 'd have to make sure that people did n't come together in large crowds , and that would mean doing away with all public viewing areas during the world cup - that 's out of the question , " schäuble said .

" i 'm really calm now , i was n't in the beginning , " said the baby 's mother , steffi müller -lrb- name changed -rrb- .
" my partner is also healthy , and so only i posed the risk , but my blood samples are really good .
and that 's why i 'm optimistic . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has made strides in fighting the hiv virus müller , who 's been undergoing treatment at the munich clinic ever since she became pregnant , received a strong drug cocktail to suppress the hiv virus and the levels of the virus in her blood were monitored regularly .
in the 38th week of her pregnancy , two weeks before the expected birth , doctors performed a caesarean on müller using a technique that involves the lowest possible amount of blood to prevent the child from coming into contact with her mother 's infectious body fluids . new medicine drastically cuts transmission rate birth is the most crucial step for an infant whose mother carries the hiv virus , said andrea gingelmaier , a doctor at the munich clinic .
she added that the child is largely protected in the womb from the virus due to the placenta . gingelmaier pointed out that rapid strides have been made in the west in preventing the hiv virus from being transmitted from mother to child . " in 1994 , a big study in america found out that a natural transmission rate , which lies between 20 and 25 percent when it comes to hiv transmission from mother to child , could be pushed by down by two-thirds to under 8 percent simply through medicines , " said gingelmaier .
" and if you combine that with a caesarean , the transmission rate can be pushed down further to under 2 percent .
today we often use not just one medicine , but several different ones - a so-called combination therapy .
and with that we 're currently down to a hiv transmission rate of under 1 percent . " steffi müller 's daughter has gotten off to a good start in life .
she has to be treated with antiretroviral syrups for about four weeks until the doctors confirm that she 's in the clear and has n't been infected by her mother . in addition , müller is n't allowed to breastfeed .
experts reckon that breastfeeding alone , depending on the duration , can increase the risk of hiv infection in a baby by about 45 percent .
almost every second hiv-positive child worldwide is infected through breastfeeding , said gingelmaier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are particularly susceptible to the hiv virus according to the world health organization , of the more than three million people who have died of aids worldwide , half a million have been children .
the overwhelming majority of hiv-positive children are infected with the virus during or immediately after birth , the who says . success not repeated in africa but the admirable progress made in germany and the rest of the western world in combating aids is hardly being repeated in the rest of the world , particularly in africa . a lack of proper medical infrastructure , exorbitantly high prices for medicines and a lack of awareness about things like breastfeeding are some of the main reasons why negligible transmission rates from mother to child in germany are unlikely to be reached in africa in the foreseeable future , according to gingelmaier . " it 's a huge problem in these countries .
even if the woman does n't breastfeed it 's a problem , because you 're then exposed as being hiv-positive and have to deal with social stigmatization , " said gingelmaier . the un for its part has said that it simply lacks the funds for a concerted effort to battle the infection in africa . the un special commissioner for hiv / aids , stephen lewis , has said that the global health fund , into which all big industrialized countries pay money to combat health problems such as aids , tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries , is in dire need of more funds .
it lacks more than $ 3 billion -lrb- 2.3 billion euros -rrb- for the years 2006 and 2007 , he said . maren hellwege-beck -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president promotes african successes on his second trip to africa , horst köhler will focus on the continent 's success stories .

he agreed with police officers who said that a person running amok would not be the typical situation . " in order to avoid such incidents you 'd have to make sure that people did n't come together in large crowds , and that would mean doing away with all public viewing areas during the world cup - that 's out of the question , " schäuble said .
" this is not a problem that must be linked to the world cup . " schäuble added that all possible precautions were being taken to guarantee the safety of the people gathering at hundreds of public viewing areas across the country during the tournament .

" we 're poised to show the world that we 're friendly hosts .

she added that the child is largely protected in the womb from the virus due to the placenta . gingelmaier pointed out that rapid strides have been made in the west in preventing the hiv virus from being transmitted from mother to child .

the overwhelming majority of hiv-positive children are infected with the virus during or immediately after birth , the who says . success not repeated in africa but the admirable progress made in germany and the rest of the western world in combating aids is hardly being repeated in the rest of the world , particularly in africa . a lack of proper medical infrastructure , exorbitantly high prices for medicines and a lack of awareness about things like breastfeeding are some of the main reasons why negligible transmission rates from mother to child in germany are unlikely to be reached in africa in the foreseeable future , according to gingelmaier . " it 's a huge problem in these countries .
even if the woman does n't breastfeed it 's a problem , because you 're then exposed as being hiv-positive and have to deal with social stigmatization , " said gingelmaier . the un for its part has said that it simply lacks the funds for a concerted effort to battle the infection in africa . the un special commissioner for hiv / aids , stephen lewis , has said that the global health fund , into which all big industrialized countries pay money to combat health problems such as aids , tuberculosis and malaria in developing countries , is in dire need of more funds .

" the whole thing is really inconsistent , " sinead jones , the director of the international union against cancer 's global smoke free partnership , told reuters news service .
" they are saying to fans : ' do n't smoke , ' but on the other hand there will be absolutely no enforcement there . " germany still lags behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cigarette machines will only accept credit cards starting in 2007 to prevent teens from buying in germany , anti-smoking groups meanwhile used world no tobacco day to renew calls for more stringent controls .
while a majority of germans support smoking bans in restaurants and bars , so far , only a voluntary agreement to designate 50 percent of seats in 90 percent of restaurants as smoke-free by 2008 exists . " creating smoking and non-smoking areas only appear to solve the problem , " said jörg-dietrich hoppe , the president of the german medical association . according to germany 's federal center for health education , about 140,000 people in germany die each year as a result of smoking .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- .

clinics are demanding reimbursement . the chairman of the association of university clinics in germany -lrb- vud -rrb- , rüdiger strehl , told the berliner zeitung daily that germany 's federal states should reimburse clinics for the economic damage they have sustained due to the ongoing strike , which he estimated at 100 million euros -lrb- $ 128 million -rrb- . " we will take legal recourse against the states , " he said in an interview with the paper , adding that the hospitals were not able to make up for the lost income on their own . doctors originally began their strikes on march 16 with a series of one-day walkouts and on monday , they began another stage of their walk-out , promising strikes that would affect all but emergency services in 38 public hospitals in nine federal states this week . more than 12,500 doctors walked off the job yesterday demanding a 30 percent pay increase and better working conditions , including regular working hours , overtime pay and time during the working week to conduct research . the hospitals say the states should be required to provide compensation since they share the blame in not finding a way to end the prolonged strike . " completely absurd " the employers ' head negotiator , lower saxony finance minister hartmut möllring , has called the demands for compensation " completely absurd , " saying there is no " legal claim to successful wage negotiations . "
he added that such compensation would make little sense , since the states would be in effect paying themselves , since the hospitals in questions are public facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking doctors want better wages and working conditions " it would be like the right hand paying the left one , " möllring said . the two sides in the debate have failed to reach an agreement even after weeks of intense negotiations .
in mid-may , the marburger bund , a doctors ' union , broke off talks with state negotiators .
the union has promised to resume work next week , but to strike again during the following week , with the world cup in full swing . some have worried that medical care during the huge event , which is expected to bring 3.5 million visitors to germany , could be compromised . still , the chairman of the marburger bund , frank ulrich montgomery , said that despite the pumped-up rhetoric , he thinks chances are good that an agreement will be wrapped up soon , as long as the states " abandon their stonewalling at the expense of patients and hospitals and return to the negotiating table . "
the union has indicated it is willing to compromise on some of its original demands . negotiator möllring , however , said the ball was now in the union 's court . " those who walk away from the table are the ones who have to come back to it , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de university doctors enter week-long strike doctors at 25 university clinics and 14 state hospitals across germany have expanded ongoing strikes , leading to the largest physician work-stoppage in the country 's history .

he agreed with police officers who said that a person running amok would not be the typical situation . " in order to avoid such incidents you 'd have to make sure that people did n't come together in large crowds , and that would mean doing away with all public viewing areas during the world cup - that 's out of the question , " schäuble said .

" we 're poised to show the world that we 're friendly hosts .
we have the best of intentions - the rest is in god 's hands . " schäuble too was anxious to stress german hospitality after a spate of negative publicity over racist attacks . " germany is an open , peaceful and tolerant country , and we will show that during the world cup , " he said . preventing hooliganism the interior minister also gave an assurance that everything possible had been done in the run-up to the world cup to avoid any incidents involving hooligan violence .
he praised what he called the " excellent cooperation " with the police and state authorities from the participating nations . in britain , more than 3,000 known soccer hooligans have been called upon to hand over their passports to police to prevent them from traveling to the world cup in germany .
they will also be required to register at a police station each time england play during the tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2006 opinion : a truly idiotic decision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not a perfect match : heine and handke by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent literary jury , german politicians are embarrassing themselves and damaging the fundaments of democratic culture , says dw-world.de 's toma tasovac . when peter handke received an honorary doctorate from the university of salzburg in 2003 , he promised he would withdraw from public life .
" this is the last time that i am showing my idiocy openly , " handke said .
and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .
back then , idiots lived on the outskirts of the city-state .
their bad judgment in political matters made them outsiders .
they were not necessarily stupid , but definitely unreasonable .
you did n't want to have anything to do with them .
they were almost as bad as foreigners . what is happening in germany right now , however , is outrageous and idiotic - in almost every sense of the word .
an independent jury awarded germany 's most prestigious prize to one of the most famous - and most difficult - writers in the german language today .
the mayor of düsseldorf called the writer personally to congratulate him .
the writer said , " thank you very much , i 'm thrilled . "
but then the political cry-baby establishment got all huffed up because the writer - whose literary genius is not questioned - is a political " idiot . " for the media , it 's a field day . a comedy of situation ? bowing to the pressure of vociferous critics and he-said-she-said media reports , a member of the jury , a historian-turned-politician , publicly distanced himself from the problematic writer - but only post factum , after the prize announcement bearing his signature was made public and the general hullabaloo came over germany .
other politicians - encouraged by the tardy return of at least one prodigal son - turned to hyperbole and , all of a sudden , the writer started sounding like an epitome of evil , lucifer with an austrian accent who ascended directly from hell to spread hate and destruction . handke , at least , admitted he was an idiot .
but the german political establishment - and especially the local politicos who rarely , if ever , get a chance to speak to a national , let alone , international audience - should pause for a moment to reflect on what they have done .
by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent jury , they have seriously damaged not only their own reputation , but the very institution of the heinrich heine prize . whoever gets this award next should think twice before accepting it - unless things are made clear and the prize gets its name changed to " heinrich heine prize for political correctness . " let 's be serious .
who needs literary critics and philosophers - not to mention literature itself - if local politicos will always know better ? toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans divided over prize for pro-serb author handke the decision to award the city of düsseldorf 's prestigious heine prize to controversial austrian author peter handke - known for his pro-serbian stance during the balkan wars - has been met with criticism in germany .

but the city council , which gives the prize money of 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 64,190 -rrb- , must approve their decision .
a vote has been scheduled for june 22 . " we 're not going to make the money available , " said one city council member . what 's the damage ? editorialists were divided on the likely decision to withhold the prize . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich heine " no one is going to dispute that this is an open affront against the jury , " wrote the left-wing fra n kfurter ru n dschau .
" but first of all , the jury was not united when doubts about the nomination arose .
and secondly , the damage for düsseldorf would be even bigger if it accepted honoring handke in the name of heine . " writers at berlin 's left-wing die tageszeitu n g saw things differently . " heine does n't deserve handke and handke does n't deserve the heine prize , " it wrote .
" but there 's no doubt that heine would have rejected the political control of a jury .
this form of censorship would be much worse than awarding the prize to the wrong person . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a milosevic supporter holds a picture of the late serbian leader during a memorial in belgrade the move to honor handke came just a month after france 's foremost theater company decided not to stage one of his plays because of a eulogy he delivered for milosevic , the former yugoslav president and alleged war criminal who died in march .
handke had described milosevic as " a man who defended his people . " while handke , who lives in france , refused to comment on the controversy regarding the decision to award him the prize , he answered his critics in an op-ed piece in the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g on tuesday . " nowhere in my work i have called slobodan milosevic ' one ' or ' the ' victim , " he wrote . un report : milosevic n ot poiso n ed while some milosevic supporters have claimed that he was poisoned in his prison cell in the hague , a new report published wednesday said that he had self-medicated himself and that experts could not agree whether surgery could have prevented his death .

and not only that : " from now on , you can take me to court , if i once again in my life appear in public . " peter handke is not easy to love .
he is also not very good about keeping promises .
he showed himself to be an " idiot " on at least one other occasion .
on march 18 , for example , he stood next to the grave of former serbian president slobodan milosevic and took part in one of the most grotesque funerals the world had ever seen . a failed , semi-forgotten leader and dark-minded opportunist , who ruined his own nation and brought nothing but death , pain and suffering to everybody else , was getting buried in his own backyard .
the whole world was watching this mock state funeral as the celebrated austrian poet - like a true court jester or , perhaps more appropriately , a politburo idiot - stood by . he seemed pensive , almost confused . there are idiots and idiots when handke speaks of himself as an idiot , he does not mean to imply that he is mentally deficient .
he also does n't see himself in the same way in which dostoevsky saw prince myshkin , the main character of his novel " the idiot " - as an overly naive goody-two-shoes , a prince of fools with a slavic soul to top it off . when handke calls himself an idiot , he does so in the original , ancient greek sense of the word idiotes : somebody lacking skills , a private person , one who is on his own .
back then , idiots lived on the outskirts of the city-state .
their bad judgment in political matters made them outsiders .
they were not necessarily stupid , but definitely unreasonable .
you did n't want to have anything to do with them .
they were almost as bad as foreigners . what is happening in germany right now , however , is outrageous and idiotic - in almost every sense of the word .
an independent jury awarded germany 's most prestigious prize to one of the most famous - and most difficult - writers in the german language today .
the mayor of düsseldorf called the writer personally to congratulate him .
the writer said , " thank you very much , i 'm thrilled . "
but then the political cry-baby establishment got all huffed up because the writer - whose literary genius is not questioned - is a political " idiot . " for the media , it 's a field day . a comedy of situation ? bowing to the pressure of vociferous critics and he-said-she-said media reports , a member of the jury , a historian-turned-politician , publicly distanced himself from the problematic writer - but only post factum , after the prize announcement bearing his signature was made public and the general hullabaloo came over germany .
other politicians - encouraged by the tardy return of at least one prodigal son - turned to hyperbole and , all of a sudden , the writer started sounding like an epitome of evil , lucifer with an austrian accent who ascended directly from hell to spread hate and destruction . handke , at least , admitted he was an idiot .
but the german political establishment - and especially the local politicos who rarely , if ever , get a chance to speak to a national , let alone , international audience - should pause for a moment to reflect on what they have done .
by declaring themselves ready to revoke the decision of an independent jury , they have seriously damaged not only their own reputation , but the very institution of the heinrich heine prize . whoever gets this award next should think twice before accepting it - unless things are made clear and the prize gets its name changed to " heinrich heine prize for political correctness .

a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .
arab tv channels broadcast them almost around the clock .
without pictures , it 's hard to imagine what exactly happened .
additionally , there 's a widespread feeling in the arab world that americans constantly commit crimes in iraq .
haditha , therefore , just gets added to the list . mathias bölinger interviewed horst müller -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .
-lrb- aug .

opinion : too much transparency is damaging along with relief over the release of two men held by their kidnappers for 99 days in iraq come speculations in german media about possible ransom payments .
that 's not a good idea , according to dw 's peter philipp .

a video image of mourners in haditha german media analyst horst müller talked to dw-world.de about why the alleged massacre of iraqis by us soldiers in haditha - unlike the torture scandal at abu ghraib prison - has not caused worldwide public outrage . müller is the author of a book entitled " all eyes on torture - abu ghraib and the media . "
he is a media professor at the university of applied sciences mittweida in eastern germany . dw-world.de : us soldiers allegedly murdered civilians at random in the iraqi town of haditha .
but apart from the left-wing die tageszeitung newspaper the incident did n't make headlines anywhere in germany .
why ? first of all , the pictures are missing .
we have seen the same thing happen in other cases in the past .
coverage of abu ghraib started relatively late , for example - and not because people did n't know about it , but simply because no pictures were available .
the second reason is that the media and the public have become tired of iraq to a certain extent .
coverage continues , but people are less and less interested .
they know about the violence , they are literally overfed with violence .
thirdly , information about haditha came out relatively late .
the issue was not discussed by george w. bush and tony blair during their recent meeting - at least not publicly .
they said that abu ghraib was the largest mistake that happened . us papers covered haditha quite extensively .
why did german media not follow suit ? we have the phenomenon of the so-called " culture of leading media " in germany .
as long as one of these leading media does not cover the issue , it is virtually nonexistent .
let me return to abu ghraib for a moment .
back then , cbs covered the scandal in the us and -lrb- german newsmagazine -rrb- der spiegel threw out a previous cover story and replaced it with abu ghraib .
only then did other german media follow suit - with a significant delay . does that mean that haditha could still receive the same coverage as abu ghraib ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picture of a hooded man with electric wires attached to his hands become an icon of the abu ghraib scandal i believe that such things should be brought into the public domain in a prominent way , but i fear that it wo n't happen in this case .
the pictures are missing .
abu ghraib coverage only started when magazines were able to put pictures on their covers and tv was able to show them again and again .
as far as i know , there are pictures from haditha that were taken by an iraqi reporter after the fact .
but the horrible pictures are missing . die tagezeitung compared the massacre to the my lai massacre during the vietnam war , which led to a change in public opinion .
is it too early to make such a comparison ? unlike during the vietnam war , resistance to the iraq war in the us is strong .
back then , my lai had a crucial influence on public opinion .
this incident now comes at a time when many americans are already against the iraqi mission .
that 's why the two can not be compared .
but the incident will naturally further cement opposition to the war in iraq . apart from a protest by iraqi premier nuri al-maliki , reactions from the arab world have been lacking .
why ? it 's the same phenomenon .
back then -lrb- during the abu ghraib scandal -rrb- , the arab public was instigated via pictures .

he agreed with police officers who said that a person running amok would not be the typical situation . " in order to avoid such incidents you 'd have to make sure that people did n't come together in large crowds , and that would mean doing away with all public viewing areas during the world cup - that 's out of the question , " schäuble said .
" this is not a problem that must be linked to the world cup . " schäuble added that all possible precautions were being taken to guarantee the safety of the people gathering at hundreds of public viewing areas across the country during the tournament .
he also criticized demands to ban the sale of alcohol to partying soccer fans as unrealistic . anti-racism campaigns the head of the german organizing committee , franz beckenbauer , said that anti-racism campaigns would feature prominently during the sports event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has launched a hospitality campaign to help guests feel more welcome " here in germany we 've seen the need for additional service and friendliness campaigns to ensure that visitors will feel at home , " beckenbauer said .
" we 're poised to show the world that we 're friendly hosts .
we have the best of intentions - the rest is in god 's hands . " schäuble too was anxious to stress german hospitality after a spate of negative publicity over racist attacks . " germany is an open , peaceful and tolerant country , and we will show that during the world cup , " he said . preventing hooliganism the interior minister also gave an assurance that everything possible had been done in the run-up to the world cup to avoid any incidents involving hooligan violence .
he praised what he called the " excellent cooperation " with the police and state authorities from the participating nations . in britain , more than 3,000 known soccer hooligans have been called upon to hand over their passports to police to prevent them from traveling to the world cup in germany .
they will also be required to register at a police station each time england play during the tournament .

over the past few days , afghanistan has been wracked by some of the worst violence seen since us-led forces toppled the taliban regime end of 2001 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kabul witnessed some severe rioting this week at least 14 people were killed in rioting that gripped the capital kabul monday after a us military truck slammed into civilian cars , killing around five people .

he agreed with police officers who said that a person running amok would not be the typical situation . " in order to avoid such incidents you 'd have to make sure that people did n't come together in large crowds , and that would mean doing away with all public viewing areas during the world cup - that 's out of the question , " schäuble said .

we have the best of intentions - the rest is in god 's hands . " schäuble too was anxious to stress german hospitality after a spate of negative publicity over racist attacks . " germany is an open , peaceful and tolerant country , and we will show that during the world cup , " he said . preventing hooliganism the interior minister also gave an assurance that everything possible had been done in the run-up to the world cup to avoid any incidents involving hooligan violence .
he praised what he called the " excellent cooperation " with the police and state authorities from the participating nations . in britain , more than 3,000 known soccer hooligans have been called upon to hand over their passports to police to prevent them from traveling to the world cup in germany .
they will also be required to register at a police station each time england play during the tournament .

it expects to raise more than £ 1bn from the flotation - which could value the business at up to £ 5.5bn - to strengthen its business .

ministers are to announce that 32 foundation trusts will be added to the list of local hospitals that patients currently choose from .
from the start of this year , people have been able to choose between four hospitals for elective surgery .
but patient groups said people tended to want to stay local so the extra choice would not mean a great deal .
patient choice has been one of the government 's key reforms to make the nhs more patient-friendly . "
patients have told us that they appreciate having choice of local hospitals " michael summers patients association list of foundation trusts since january , patients have had a choice of at least four hospitals for treatment , one of which can be a private centre .
many primary care trusts included more than the minimum of four on their lists , to which they will now add the 32 foundation trusts - top performing hospitals which have been given more autonomy than other hospitals .
choice will be extended later in the year to include 15 private clinics providing nhs care from treating hip replacements to cataract operations .
and by 2008 patients will be able to choose to go to any hospital in the country .
a task force has also been set up under mayur lakhani , chairman of the royal college of gps , to investigate how to extend patient choice into other areas of healthcare .
but despite the government 's enthusiasm for the reforms , opinion polls have consistently rated it as a low priority for patients .
patients ' not interested ' the department of health 's own research published at the launch of patient choice in january found that eight out of 10 people knew little about it .
and only 14 % would be prepared to travel outside their area for treatment .
the roll-out has also been hampered by delays to the £ 6.2bn it upgrade .
as part of the project , a system called choose and book was meant to set up to allow appointments to be made online . "
we are at last putting patients in control and creating a health service where care is provided to their convenience and not the health provider " andy burnham , heath minister but only a quarter of gp surgeries had the system in place at the beginning of the year and a fifth still do not have it , the latest figures suggest .
michael summers , chairman of the patients association , said : " patients have told us that they appreciate having choice of local hospitals .
" however , it also seems they are not all that interested in being able to go to hospitals anywhere in the country .
" there are exceptions , but on the whole extending the choice does not mean a great deal to many . "
and alyson pollock , professor of public health policy at the university of edinburgh , questioned whether the public really wanted choice as opposed to good local services .
" the people who will be able to exercise their choice will be the people with the information at their disposal , something that clearly will put the middle classes at a benefit . "
but health minister andy burnham said he believed expanding the system would lead to improved patient care .
" we are at last putting patients in control and creating a health service where care is provided to their convenience and not the health provider . "
but the tories accused the government of making a reannouncement and urged ministers to extend choice to all hospitals .
and liberal democrat health spokesman steve webb said the move would further destabilise and already " fragile " health service .
a report on patient choice is due to be published by the king 's fund health think-tank on wednesday .

your views choice only has any meaning for people in and around london , with its concentration of hospitals and specialist services .
the rest of us want our local hospital to be clean , efficient and reliable .

mat jordan , sheffield , uk i would definitely be happy to travel outside of my local area for treatment .
the more choices that are opened up to people , the more the underperforming hospitals will have to challenge their internal issues of bad management / reputation / unhygenic environments !

i 've been in hospitals in the poorest part of southern italy that have better quality care and cleanliness than the big hospital in leicester where my grandfather stayed for a long time .
it 's just silly that hospitals in england are not all of a high standard .
helen forbes , cambridge all this talk of ' choice ' is nothing more than an interesting insight into hermeneutics .
let me give you a local example that makes nonsense of the use of the word .
the local health trusts in huddersfield recently , despite opposition from many local people , decided that consultant-supported maternity care would only be available in halifax , and have stopped the service in huddersfield .
i 'm sure many others can provide you with similar examples from around the country .
with services being ' rationalised ' choice will mean nothing more than selecting the least worst option .
bill smith , leeds choice is important because without it , the sort of service required by everyone , is unlikely ever to be delivered .
choice is a means to an end .
i do n't want a choice in cars either - i just want the right type of car to be available to me .
this is only ever going to happen as a result of competition - i.e. choice simon humphries , london , england it seems to me that choose and book has two possible outcomes : 1 -rrb- the money diverted away from genuine health care means that there will be a choice of 4 mediocre hospitals , rather than just going to your local one made good by better funding 2 -rrb- given that acute care trusts are funded from the pcts on services delivered , those hospitals which get selected more often will be better funded , better equipped , and thus more selected in future .
this would lead to a two-tier healthcare system - perhaps even leading to the closure of small local hospitals .
hardly patient choice !
alasdair moffat , stoke-on-trent , uk choice has always been something that has been considered by the wise and the good to be something that ordinary people are incapable of exercising in a rational and reasonable way .
the reaction of some health professionals and politicians is usually informed only by their own opinions and of their equally blinkered peers .
there are many ways in which people will choose to exercise this extension of the number and location of hospitals from which they they can select .
i suggest just one example which is driven not by performance league tables , but by sheer convenience .
it may be that an elderly person might choose to be treated close to their family which happens to be resident in another part of the country .
the benefits that might result are obvious and wide ranging .

ministers are to announce that 32 foundation trusts will be added to the list of local hospitals that patients currently choose from .
from the start of this year , people have been able to choose between four hospitals for elective surgery .
but patient groups said people tended to want to stay local so the extra choice would not mean a great deal .
patient choice has been one of the government 's key reforms to make the nhs more patient-friendly .
patients have told us that they appreciate having choice of local hospitals michael summers patients association list of foundation trusts since january , patients have had a choice of at least four hospitals for treatment , one of which can be a private centre .
many primary care trusts included more than the minimum of four on their lists , to which they will now add the 32 foundation trusts - top performing hospitals which have been given more autonomy than other hospitals .
choice will be extended later in the year to include 15 private clinics providing nhs care from treating hip replacements to cataract operations .
and by 2008 patients will be able to choose to go to any hospital in the country .
a task force has also been set up under mayur lakhani , chairman of the royal college of gps , to investigate how to extend patient choice into other areas of healthcare .
but despite the government 's enthusiasm for the reforms , opinion polls have consistently rated it as a low priority for patients .
patients ' not interested ' the department of health 's own research published at the launch of patient choice in january found that eight out of 10 people knew little about it .
and only 14 % would be prepared to travel outside their area for treatment .
the roll-out has also been hampered by delays to the £ 6.2bn it upgrade .
as part of the project , a system called choose and book was meant to set up to allow appointments to be made online .
we are at last putting patients in control and creating a health service where care is provided to their convenience and not the health provider andy burnham , heath minister but only a quarter of gp surgeries had the system in place at the beginning of the year and a fifth still do not have it , the latest figures suggest .
michael summers , chairman of the patients association , said : " patients have told us that they appreciate having choice of local hospitals .
" however , it also seems they are not all that interested in being able to go to hospitals anywhere in the country .
" there are exceptions , but on the whole extending the choice does not mean a great deal to many . "
and alyson pollock , professor of public health policy at the university of edinburgh , questioned whether the public really wanted choice as opposed to good local services .
" the people who will be able to exercise their choice will be the people with the information at their disposal , something that clearly will put the middle classes at a benefit . "
but health minister andy burnham said he believed expanding the system would lead to improved patient care .
" we are at last putting patients in control and creating a health service where care is provided to their convenience and not the health provider . "
but the tories accused the government of making a reannouncement and urged ministers to extend choice to all hospitals .
and liberal democrat health spokesman steve webb said the move would further destabilise and already " fragile " health service .
a report on patient choice is due to be published by the king 's fund health think-tank on wednesday .
how important is it to be able to choose where to receive nhs treatment ?
would you prefer to travel outside your area for treatment ?
send us your comments about patient choice using the form below .
your views choice only has any meaning for people in and around london , with its concentration of hospitals and specialist services .
the rest of us want our local hospital to be clean , efficient and reliable .
yes we do want the nhs to be more flexible when booking hospital appointments , but i do n't believe many people want to shop around for their treatment in the way they do for an electricity supplier .
mat jordan , sheffield , uk i would definitely be happy to travel outside of my local area for treatment .
the more choices that are opened up to people , the more the underperforming hospitals will have to challenge their internal issues of bad management / reputation / unhygenic environments !
sally harris , newcastle upon tyne why ca n't local hospitals be brought up to standard so that people do n't have to travel ?
i 've been in hospitals in the poorest part of southern italy that have better quality care and cleanliness than the big hospital in leicester where my grandfather stayed for a long time .
it 's just silly that hospitals in england are not all of a high standard .
helen forbes , cambridge all this talk of ' choice ' is nothing more than an interesting insight into hermeneutics .

" this move is in response to growing demand for flat-panel tvs worldwide , " ips said in a statement .
" presently , in addition to the roll out of digital broadcasting , upcoming events of global interest such as the 2006 fifa world cup in june this year and the 2008 beijing summer olympic games are spurring a rapid increase in demand for flat-panel digital tvs , " it added .

the move should help hitachi , mitsubishi and toshiba - which also owns a stake in ips - to grab a share in the fastest growing segment of the flat-screen market .
according to research by displaysearch , lcd tv shipments surged 137 % in the fourth quarter , compared with a 109 % rise for plasma tvs .
the report also forecast that demand for lcd panels for tvs will jump threefold over the coming three years .
in order to pay for the expansion plans , ips will raise 30bn yen by issuing new shares to matsushita and hitachi , both taking half .
the move will leave hitachi with a 50 % stake in the venture , while matsushita will hold 30 % and toshiba 15 % .

" oh come on , do i look like i 'm dying ? , " the 74-year-old asked during an interview on cnn .
" do i look like or sound like i have alzheimer 's ? "
she said tabloids printed such stories " because they have nothing else dirty to write about anybody else " .
she added she was using a wheelchair because of a bad back and osteoporosis .
alzheimer 's is a degenerative brain disease which affects memory , thinking and behaviour .
dame elizabeth described herself as happy and busy with a new venture designing jewellery , which she said was " one of my passions " .
she will continue to campaign for greater awareness of aids and help for those suffering from the illness .
' return to acting ' the actress became emotional when asked about her friend michael jackson , who was acquitted last june of charges that he molested a boy during overnight stays at the singer 's home .
" i 've never been so angry in my life , " she said of the case brought against jackson .
" i 've been there , when his nephews were there , and we all were in the bed watching television .
" there was nothing abnormal about it .
there was no touchy-feely thing going on . "
she added : " we laughed like children and we watched a lot of walt disney .
there was nothing odd about it . "
the star said she gravitated toward jackson because " we 're very much alike " , and they had " both had horrible childhoods " .
dame elizabeth 's last screen appearance was in the tv movie these old broads in 2001 , which co-starred debbie reynolds , shirley maclaine and joan collins .
her most recent feature film performance was in the 1994 live-action comedy the flintstones .
however , she said did not want to retire and was willing to return to acting if she were offered a role that was " really juicy and spicy and challenging " .

officials have proposed to transfer control of louth hospital from the united lincolnshire hospitals nhs trust over to local gps .
the move , part of plans to reduce lincolnshire 's nhs debt would mean some operations and emergency cases would have to be moved to other hospitals .
proposers say it would improve services and cut waiting times for patients .
central location dr yvonne owen , who sits on the board which would oversee the new facility , said : " what 's happened over the last six to nine months is all of the east lindsey gps have joined together and identified louth as an ideal central location for healthcare services .
" we are working closely with the trust to make sure that the hospital does continue to provide healthcare but in a way that is particularly designed to give the best possible service to the local people . "
but councillor jeremy webb , leader of east lindsey district council has demanded more reassurances about the future of hospital services in louth .
he said : " it is potentially good news they 're not talking about closing the facility , so we have to take some heart from that .
turnaround plan " however , i do n't like the way we 're being fed snippets of information about the future of healthcare in east lindsey .
" we need the full picture . "
nhs managers are due to meet staff on wednesday over the future of other health services in lincolnshire .
they are expected to outline the latest position of a turnaround plan , which was due to be revealed on wednesday but has been delayed until next month .
unison has warned that plans to tackle chronic overspending problems , could involve many redundancies .

planning officials will tell councillors meeting on wednesday that a hearing is inevitable .
officers are suggesting the appointment of one advocate to represent the local authorities affected to keep fees down .
scottish and southern energy claims the new beauly to denny power line is needed to meet green energy targets .
the largest of the 600 electricity pylons on the 137-mile route would be 65m high .
wallace monument the line would cross the cairngorms national park and pass within sight of the wallace monument in stirling .
objections have already been lodged by the cairngorms national park authority , scottish natural heritage , highland council , perth and kinross council and stirling council .
the scottish executive has told highland council that an inquiry should begin in early 2007 and it is estimated it would sit for approximately nine months .
a report put together by council planning officials on how to limit the costs will be presented to the authority 's planning and development committee on wednesday .
they recommend appointing one advocate to represent all the local authorities affected .
however , the report points out that even the costs of a single lawyer would be between £ 270,000 and £ 450,000 .
on top of that would be the expense of professional witnesses such as engineers to advise on burying sections of the power line through environmentally sensitive areas .
a special meeting of highland council 's planning committee was held in inverness in april to consider the application .
a presentation was made by sse officials and objectors also had the opportunity to make their views known .
later , john rennilson , the council 's planning director , said the committee recognised that a high voltage electricity transmission system was key for the development of renewable energy in the highlands .
maintenance problems but he said councillors did not feel that the proposal presented to them was acceptable .
the committee said it also wanted to wait for a government report on the possible link associated with high voltage overhead power lines and cases of childhood leukaemia .
mr rennilson said alternatives to the power line - such as laying it underground - must be explored at the earliest opportunity .
sse head of sustainable development , dr keith maclean , said under-grounding would cost much more and mean environmental and maintenance problems .
but he said the option of burying some sections had not been ruled out .
