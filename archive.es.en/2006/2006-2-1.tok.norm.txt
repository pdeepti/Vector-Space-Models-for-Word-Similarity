springer , publisher of the mass-circulation daily bild , had originally signed an agreement with prosiebensat.1 's owner , us-israeli billionaire haim saban , to acquire the broadcaster for 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.0 billion -rrb- in august .
but the merger was blocked both by the media watchdog kek and the federal cartel office on the grounds that it would give springer a dominant market position in advertising and too much influence over public opinion . in face of such fierce resistance , springer announced on wednesday that it was throwing in the towel . " the management board of axel springer and p7s1 holding -lrb- the investor group led by haim saban 's saban capital group -rrb- announced today that they have mutually agreed to terminate plans for axel springer to acquire prosiebensat.1 media , " the newspaper publisher said in a statement .

media reports have suggested that tf1 of france , nbc universal and viacom of the united states could now take a fresh look at the business . the prospect of a fresh takeover battle sent shares in prosiebensat.1 soaring in frankfurt .
the price of shares was showing a gain of 0.70 euros or 3.72 percent at 19.50 euros in mid-morning trade . springer drew the line initially , springer had conceded it was ready to sell one of the group 's four tv channels - the popular prosieben channel - to try and win regulatory approval for the deal .
alongside prosieben , prosiebensat.1 also owns the sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 channels .
but the federal anti-trust office had insisted that prosieben be sold before the takeover , a condition springer was unwilling to fulfill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer decided it was n't worth pursuing the deal springer could have sought special permission from the government to overturn the anti-trust office 's ruling .
but after " extensive analysis and careful consideration of the possibilities for an appeal and other available options , axel springer and p7s1 holding came to the conclusion that in light of the numerous economic and legal uncertainties , a possible appeal or a possible application for a ministerial permit would have resulted in unacceptable risks for all parties involved , " the springer statement continued . " as a consequence , neither the share purchase agreement dated august 5 , 2005 , nor the voluntary public takeover offer made to the shareholders of prosiebensat.1 media will be consummated , " it concluded . prosiebensat.1 chairman guillaume de posch said the takeover by springer " would have been a good solution .

but residents of the east founded a committee that fought hard to prevent another part of their culture from being swallowed up in the reunification process .
part of east german identity today , there are even areas in western berlin where broken traffic lights have been replaced with ones featuring the inimitable ampelmännchen . " the ossis said that one could not do away with everything that set them apart .
especially since it was something rather fun , " heckhausen told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german traffic light man 's fame is turning to notoriety . the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by traffic psychologist karl peglau after an increase in cars in east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible .
the ampelmännchen became a much-loved figure in east germany decades before he would become something of a mascot for berlin and one of the tourist attractions of the new german capital . in the 1980s , a cartoon ampelmann explained traffic rules to east german children on television and around the same time an east berlin-based businessman , joachim rossberg , began selling ampelmännchen memorabilia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.02.2006 keeping up with the pradas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has the talent to be a fashion player , but needs encouragement the week of all-night parties and forests of clothing racks known as berlin fashion week has come to an end .
the capital is a fashionista destination , but will it ever reach the iconic status of a new york or a paris ? so how big can berlin 's fashion scene get ?
as profitable as tokyo 's ?
as glamorous as new york 's ?
as legendary as paris ' ? anita bachelin smiles and then gives a half answer .
" it could be better , but in a different way , " she says .
she thumbs the dial on her blackberry in the vip lounge of the fashion trade show she and partner norbert tillman created in berlin from scratch in 2003 .
in two years , it has become the city 's biggest , joining with major-brand trade show bread & butter and three smaller trade fairs to firmly establish berlin as germany 's fashion capital . soho of europe the hype that has surrounded the city 's young design scene in recent years is the reason tens of thousands of buyers representing clients from los angeles to hong kong , international journalists and hundreds of labels have descended on berlin in the past five days . " berlin is not just fashion , it 's creativity , " says bachelin , fishing a ringing nokia out of her snakeskin purse .
" new yorkers say it ’ s the soho of europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premium has gone from 60 exhibitors in 2003 , to more than 600 this year but as the hype that has surrounded berlin 's burgeoning fashion scene inevitably fades , industry figures like bachelin and tillmann are fighting to ensure the city loses none of the traction it has gained in recent years . cheap rents and low costs of living have nurtured a booming creative scene in post-wall berlin that ranges from art to music , from film to fashion .
berlin designers sell in tokyo department stores , paris showrooms and are featured in magazine spreads .
this year , vogue doyenne anna wintour sent one of her assistants to check out the premium show , says bachelin . some way to go the growth of the city 's two big fairs has been so impressive - premium featured more than 600 exhibitors and bread & butter around 500 - that berlin city officials , who last year began sponsoring an additional trade show , have unified the shows under the title , berlin fashion week .
but if the name is supposed to invoke the glamour of milan , london and new york , the reality is different . " german fashion is not there yet , " said dylan ross , buyer for question air , which supplies stores in london .
" but its potential as a platform is enormous . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor wowereit , here with boris becker 's ex-wife , at a fashion event sunday unlike london - where the government hitched the city 's creative scene to its " cool britannia " campaign - berlin government officials have been slow to recognize the image gain and economic potential in the clothing business .
though it provides small atelier subsidies and other grants , the city has only invested 1.3 million euros in the industry between 1993 and 2005 , according to a economics ministry report .
neither premium nor bread & butter gets any financial support . " they do give us an ear , " says bachelin .
" but we 're -lrb- the ones -rrb- promoting berlin . " a unified effort things are beginning to change .
city officials like the city 's economics senator and mayor klaus wowereit are now trade show regulars , with wowereit giving a speech of thanks -lrb- in english -rrb- at an adidas originals runway show on sunday night .
the berlin trade show association started the " b in berlin " trade show in january 2005 , and joined with premium and new show " fifth floor " to form the " berlin fashion week " event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bread & butter catwalk show from the weekend but state support alone wo n't help . markus klosseck , designer and president of the label aemkei moved his company to berlin from new york two years ago .
though benefiting from the city 's cheap rents and its central european location , he thinks there needs to be more investment in retail and more cooperation between the various trade shows before berlin can be mentioned in the same breath as new york , london or tokyo . " what they 're doing now is not helping the buyer , " he said .
" there 's too many trade shows , too many events and the -lrb- buyers -rrb- are confused . " expansion plans bachelin says to be patient . “ it ’ s still coming , " she said .
" we ’ re talking about 3.5 years !
new york had ten years and paris had 100 years to establish itself . " for the time being , all bachelin and her colleagues can continue to do is spread berlin 's good reputation .
bread & butter last year launched a barcelona event that attracted 48,000 people during its first weekend .
in the coming weeks , premium will take seven berlin designers to milan and tokyo to feature in trade shows there .
" times are changing , " says bachelin . maybe berlin 's fashion status will as well . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star designer leaves berlin sometimes she made her students cry , but she also inspired them to be bold and inventive .
the quirkiest and loudest of all iconic designers , vivienne westwood , has left berlin , where she taught for the past 12 years . ´ -lrb- july 4 , 2005 -rrb- berlin becomes fashionista capital this weekend , berlin will drown in a sea of designer clothes , air kisses and runway models .
two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital .

the capital is a fashionista destination , but will it ever reach the iconic status of a new york or a paris ? so how big can berlin 's fashion scene get ?
as profitable as tokyo 's ?
as glamorous as new york 's ?
as legendary as paris ' ? anita bachelin smiles and then gives a half answer .
" it could be better , but in a different way , " she says .
she thumbs the dial on her blackberry in the vip lounge of the fashion trade show she and partner norbert tillman created in berlin from scratch in 2003 .
in two years , it has become the city 's biggest , joining with major-brand trade show bread & butter and three smaller trade fairs to firmly establish berlin as germany 's fashion capital . soho of europe the hype that has surrounded the city 's young design scene in recent years is the reason tens of thousands of buyers representing clients from los angeles to hong kong , international journalists and hundreds of labels have descended on berlin in the past five days . " berlin is not just fashion , it 's creativity , " says bachelin , fishing a ringing nokia out of her snakeskin purse .
" new yorkers say it ’ s the soho of europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premium has gone from 60 exhibitors in 2003 , to more than 600 this year but as the hype that has surrounded berlin 's burgeoning fashion scene inevitably fades , industry figures like bachelin and tillmann are fighting to ensure the city loses none of the traction it has gained in recent years . cheap rents and low costs of living have nurtured a booming creative scene in post-wall berlin that ranges from art to music , from film to fashion .
berlin designers sell in tokyo department stores , paris showrooms and are featured in magazine spreads .
this year , vogue doyenne anna wintour sent one of her assistants to check out the premium show , says bachelin . some way to go the growth of the city 's two big fairs has been so impressive - premium featured more than 600 exhibitors and bread & butter around 500 - that berlin city officials , who last year began sponsoring an additional trade show , have unified the shows under the title , berlin fashion week .
but if the name is supposed to invoke the glamour of milan , london and new york , the reality is different . " german fashion is not there yet , " said dylan ross , buyer for question air , which supplies stores in london .
" but its potential as a platform is enormous . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor wowereit , here with boris becker 's ex-wife , at a fashion event sunday unlike london - where the government hitched the city 's creative scene to its " cool britannia " campaign - berlin government officials have been slow to recognize the image gain and economic potential in the clothing business .
though it provides small atelier subsidies and other grants , the city has only invested 1.3 million euros in the industry between 1993 and 2005 , according to a economics ministry report .
neither premium nor bread & butter gets any financial support . " they do give us an ear , " says bachelin .
" but we 're -lrb- the ones -rrb- promoting berlin . " a unified effort things are beginning to change .
city officials like the city 's economics senator and mayor klaus wowereit are now trade show regulars , with wowereit giving a speech of thanks -lrb- in english -rrb- at an adidas originals runway show on sunday night .
the berlin trade show association started the " b in berlin " trade show in january 2005 , and joined with premium and new show " fifth floor " to form the " berlin fashion week " event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bread & butter catwalk show from the weekend but state support alone wo n't help . markus klosseck , designer and president of the label aemkei moved his company to berlin from new york two years ago .
though benefiting from the city 's cheap rents and its central european location , he thinks there needs to be more investment in retail and more cooperation between the various trade shows before berlin can be mentioned in the same breath as new york , london or tokyo . " what they 're doing now is not helping the buyer , " he said .
" there 's too many trade shows , too many events and the -lrb- buyers -rrb- are confused . " expansion plans bachelin says to be patient . “ it ’ s still coming , " she said .
" we ’ re talking about 3.5 years !
new york had ten years and paris had 100 years to establish itself . " for the time being , all bachelin and her colleagues can continue to do is spread berlin 's good reputation .
bread & butter last year launched a barcelona event that attracted 48,000 people during its first weekend .
in the coming weeks , premium will take seven berlin designers to milan and tokyo to feature in trade shows there .
" times are changing , " says bachelin . maybe berlin 's fashion status will as well . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star designer leaves berlin sometimes she made her students cry , but she also inspired them to be bold and inventive .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .
" experience has shown us that deporting these women quickly is only in the best interests of the culprits . " sally beeckman , a criminologist for pag-asa in brussels who helps victims in the courts and over various administrative hurdles , confirmed that investigations depend on these witnesses and that personal testimony is important in bringing cases to trial . " it 's kind of a give and take system , " she said .
" the person agrees to make a statement and to help in the investigation and the person gets the possibility to stay here even if it 's sometimes only temporary . " i n creased protectio n n eeded european parliamentarian gröner wants to see better protection for the victims , but she would also like to see prosecutors go after the men who go to prostitutes who they know are working against their will .
she said information campaigns would help protect women and sensitize europeans about the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's red light district " the world cup gives us an opportunity to see with our own eyes that there are thousands of women here who are being forced into prostitution , " she said .
" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .
it can not act in many cases on its own , but has to first get permission from national governments , which has slowed the fight against international human trafficking . still , most aid organizations doubt that germany will change its residency laws or go on the offensive against johns , even in the lead-up to the world cup and under political pressure from brussels . but for anna , at least , the outlook is pretty positive .
she herself said she just wants the basics : a house to live in , a nice job and to take care of her child . " to have just a normal life , like everybody , " she said . marlis schaum -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de concerns over projected influx of prostitutes for world cup germany is braced for an influx of not only three million football fans to next year 's world cup but also thousands of illegal sex workers from eastern europe .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .
" experience has shown us that deporting these women quickly is only in the best interests of the culprits . " sally beeckman , a criminologist for pag-asa in brussels who helps victims in the courts and over various administrative hurdles , confirmed that investigations depend on these witnesses and that personal testimony is important in bringing cases to trial . " it 's kind of a give and take system , " she said .

" i n creased protectio n n eeded european parliamentarian gröner wants to see better protection for the victims , but she would also like to see prosecutors go after the men who go to prostitutes who they know are working against their will .
she said information campaigns would help protect women and sensitize europeans about the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's red light district " the world cup gives us an opportunity to see with our own eyes that there are thousands of women here who are being forced into prostitution , " she said .
" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .
it can not act in many cases on its own , but has to first get permission from national governments , which has slowed the fight against international human trafficking . still , most aid organizations doubt that germany will change its residency laws or go on the offensive against johns , even in the lead-up to the world cup and under political pressure from brussels . but for anna , at least , the outlook is pretty positive .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .
" experience has shown us that deporting these women quickly is only in the best interests of the culprits . " sally beeckman , a criminologist for pag-asa in brussels who helps victims in the courts and over various administrative hurdles , confirmed that investigations depend on these witnesses and that personal testimony is important in bringing cases to trial . " it 's kind of a give and take system , " she said .
" the person agrees to make a statement and to help in the investigation and the person gets the possibility to stay here even if it 's sometimes only temporary . " i n creased protectio n n eeded european parliamentarian gröner wants to see better protection for the victims , but she would also like to see prosecutors go after the men who go to prostitutes who they know are working against their will .
she said information campaigns would help protect women and sensitize europeans about the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's red light district " the world cup gives us an opportunity to see with our own eyes that there are thousands of women here who are being forced into prostitution , " she said .
" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .

springer , publisher of the mass-circulation daily bild , had originally signed an agreement with prosiebensat.1 's owner , us-israeli billionaire haim saban , to acquire the broadcaster for 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.0 billion -rrb- in august .
but the merger was blocked both by the media watchdog kek and the federal cartel office on the grounds that it would give springer a dominant market position in advertising and too much influence over public opinion . in face of such fierce resistance , springer announced on wednesday that it was throwing in the towel . " the management board of axel springer and p7s1 holding -lrb- the investor group led by haim saban 's saban capital group -rrb- announced today that they have mutually agreed to terminate plans for axel springer to acquire prosiebensat.1 media , " the newspaper publisher said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saban said he 'd look for alternatives to springer saban issued a statement in munich expressing " disappointment " with the development .
he was nevertheless " extremely satisfied " with the tv group 's performance and would now examine " alternatives " to the springer deal , saban said . the development means the broadcaster could find another buyer .
media reports have suggested that tf1 of france , nbc universal and viacom of the united states could now take a fresh look at the business . the prospect of a fresh takeover battle sent shares in prosiebensat.1 soaring in frankfurt .
the price of shares was showing a gain of 0.70 euros or 3.72 percent at 19.50 euros in mid-morning trade . springer drew the line initially , springer had conceded it was ready to sell one of the group 's four tv channels - the popular prosieben channel - to try and win regulatory approval for the deal .
alongside prosieben , prosiebensat.1 also owns the sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 channels .
but the federal anti-trust office had insisted that prosieben be sold before the takeover , a condition springer was unwilling to fulfill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer decided it was n't worth pursuing the deal springer could have sought special permission from the government to overturn the anti-trust office 's ruling .
but after " extensive analysis and careful consideration of the possibilities for an appeal and other available options , axel springer and p7s1 holding came to the conclusion that in light of the numerous economic and legal uncertainties , a possible appeal or a possible application for a ministerial permit would have resulted in unacceptable risks for all parties involved , " the springer statement continued . " as a consequence , neither the share purchase agreement dated august 5 , 2005 , nor the voluntary public takeover offer made to the shareholders of prosiebensat.1 media will be consummated , " it concluded . prosiebensat.1 chairman guillaume de posch said the takeover by springer " would have been a good solution . "
the broadcaster would now focus on " expanding further under our own strength and concentrate on our operating business , " de posch said .
" our aim is strengthen our core tv business further and to diversify sales .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .
" experience has shown us that deporting these women quickly is only in the best interests of the culprits . " sally beeckman , a criminologist for pag-asa in brussels who helps victims in the courts and over various administrative hurdles , confirmed that investigations depend on these witnesses and that personal testimony is important in bringing cases to trial . " it 's kind of a give and take system , " she said .
" the person agrees to make a statement and to help in the investigation and the person gets the possibility to stay here even if it 's sometimes only temporary . " i n creased protectio n n eeded european parliamentarian gröner wants to see better protection for the victims , but she would also like to see prosecutors go after the men who go to prostitutes who they know are working against their will .
she said information campaigns would help protect women and sensitize europeans about the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's red light district " the world cup gives us an opportunity to see with our own eyes that there are thousands of women here who are being forced into prostitution , " she said .
" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .
it can not act in many cases on its own , but has to first get permission from national governments , which has slowed the fight against international human trafficking . still , most aid organizations doubt that germany will change its residency laws or go on the offensive against johns , even in the lead-up to the world cup and under political pressure from brussels . but for anna , at least , the outlook is pretty positive .
she herself said she just wants the basics : a house to live in , a nice job and to take care of her child .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.02.2006 traffic-light man in tug-of-war between east and west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus heckhausen 's right to use the traffic-light man is being contested he survived the fall of communism , but the trials and tribulations of the traffic-light man from former east germany are far from over . two businessmen - one from eastern germany and one from the west - are now waging a patent rights battle over the ampelmännchen which the press has played up as proof of the tension between the two parts of the once-divided country . markus heckhausen , a designer from tübingen in southern germany , moved to berlin in 1995 and two years later began selling items ranging from t-shirts to fridge magnets , flip-flops and fruit drops bearing the ampelmännchen - who was named after the german word for traffic light . by then the germans from the former east , or ossis , had won the battle to keep their iconic little figure with his hat and his arms spread wide in warning when the light is red .
initially after the iron curtain fell , the german authorities wanted to replace him with the skinnier , less expressive traffic symbol used in the rest of germany .
but residents of the east founded a committee that fought hard to prevent another part of their culture from being swallowed up in the reunification process .
part of east german identity today , there are even areas in western berlin where broken traffic lights have been replaced with ones featuring the inimitable ampelmännchen . " the ossis said that one could not do away with everything that set them apart .
especially since it was something rather fun , " heckhausen told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german traffic light man 's fame is turning to notoriety . the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by traffic psychologist karl peglau after an increase in cars in east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible .
the ampelmännchen became a much-loved figure in east germany decades before he would become something of a mascot for berlin and one of the tourist attractions of the new german capital . in the 1980s , a cartoon ampelmann explained traffic rules to east german children on television and around the same time an east berlin-based businessman , joachim rossberg , began selling ampelmännchen memorabilia .
battle between east and west ?
rossberg and heckhausen are now facing each other in court , with the former accusing his rival of having infringed his patents for ampelmännchen toys and brandy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rossberg 's company also makes traffic-light women " whether people like it or not , the ampelmännchen remains a symbol of the east .
my company is the one that originally began producing memorabilia , i was doing this long before the iron curtain came down , " rossberg said . heckhausen has countered that rossberg has not exercised his patent rights for the past five years and that they have therefore passed back into the public domain .
his ampelmännchen memorabilia company employs 30 people and made some 2.4 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- in 2005 . the entrepreneur angrily rejected the picture created in the press of a greedy wessi , using the nickname for western germans , stealing from a poor ossi . " it 's a cliche .
our litigation can hardly be seen as a battle between east and west , " he said . a court in leipzig , in the east of the country , is expected to rule on the matter on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.02.2006 traffic-light man in tug-of-war between east and west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus heckhausen 's right to use the traffic-light man is being contested he survived the fall of communism , but the trials and tribulations of the traffic-light man from former east germany are far from over . two businessmen - one from eastern germany and one from the west - are now waging a patent rights battle over the ampelmännchen which the press has played up as proof of the tension between the two parts of the once-divided country . markus heckhausen , a designer from tübingen in southern germany , moved to berlin in 1995 and two years later began selling items ranging from t-shirts to fridge magnets , flip-flops and fruit drops bearing the ampelmännchen - who was named after the german word for traffic light . by then the germans from the former east , or ossis , had won the battle to keep their iconic little figure with his hat and his arms spread wide in warning when the light is red .
initially after the iron curtain fell , the german authorities wanted to replace him with the skinnier , less expressive traffic symbol used in the rest of germany .
but residents of the east founded a committee that fought hard to prevent another part of their culture from being swallowed up in the reunification process .
part of east german identity today , there are even areas in western berlin where broken traffic lights have been replaced with ones featuring the inimitable ampelmännchen . " the ossis said that one could not do away with everything that set them apart .
especially since it was something rather fun , " heckhausen told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german traffic light man 's fame is turning to notoriety . the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by traffic psychologist karl peglau after an increase in cars in east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible .
the ampelmännchen became a much-loved figure in east germany decades before he would become something of a mascot for berlin and one of the tourist attractions of the new german capital . in the 1980s , a cartoon ampelmann explained traffic rules to east german children on television and around the same time an east berlin-based businessman , joachim rossberg , began selling ampelmännchen memorabilia .
battle between east and west ?
rossberg and heckhausen are now facing each other in court , with the former accusing his rival of having infringed his patents for ampelmännchen toys and brandy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rossberg 's company also makes traffic-light women " whether people like it or not , the ampelmännchen remains a symbol of the east .
my company is the one that originally began producing memorabilia , i was doing this long before the iron curtain came down , " rossberg said . heckhausen has countered that rossberg has not exercised his patent rights for the past five years and that they have therefore passed back into the public domain .
his ampelmännchen memorabilia company employs 30 people and made some 2.4 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- in 2005 . the entrepreneur angrily rejected the picture created in the press of a greedy wessi , using the nickname for western germans , stealing from a poor ossi . " it 's a cliche .
our litigation can hardly be seen as a battle between east and west , " he said . a court in leipzig , in the east of the country , is expected to rule on the matter on feb .

springer , publisher of the mass-circulation daily bild , had originally signed an agreement with prosiebensat.1 's owner , us-israeli billionaire haim saban , to acquire the broadcaster for 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.0 billion -rrb- in august .
but the merger was blocked both by the media watchdog kek and the federal cartel office on the grounds that it would give springer a dominant market position in advertising and too much influence over public opinion . in face of such fierce resistance , springer announced on wednesday that it was throwing in the towel . " the management board of axel springer and p7s1 holding -lrb- the investor group led by haim saban 's saban capital group -rrb- announced today that they have mutually agreed to terminate plans for axel springer to acquire prosiebensat.1 media , " the newspaper publisher said in a statement .

he was nevertheless " extremely satisfied " with the tv group 's performance and would now examine " alternatives " to the springer deal , saban said . the development means the broadcaster could find another buyer .
media reports have suggested that tf1 of france , nbc universal and viacom of the united states could now take a fresh look at the business . the prospect of a fresh takeover battle sent shares in prosiebensat.1 soaring in frankfurt .
the price of shares was showing a gain of 0.70 euros or 3.72 percent at 19.50 euros in mid-morning trade . springer drew the line initially , springer had conceded it was ready to sell one of the group 's four tv channels - the popular prosieben channel - to try and win regulatory approval for the deal .
alongside prosieben , prosiebensat.1 also owns the sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 channels .
but the federal anti-trust office had insisted that prosieben be sold before the takeover , a condition springer was unwilling to fulfill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer decided it was n't worth pursuing the deal springer could have sought special permission from the government to overturn the anti-trust office 's ruling .
but after " extensive analysis and careful consideration of the possibilities for an appeal and other available options , axel springer and p7s1 holding came to the conclusion that in light of the numerous economic and legal uncertainties , a possible appeal or a possible application for a ministerial permit would have resulted in unacceptable risks for all parties involved , " the springer statement continued . " as a consequence , neither the share purchase agreement dated august 5 , 2005 , nor the voluntary public takeover offer made to the shareholders of prosiebensat.1 media will be consummated , " it concluded . prosiebensat.1 chairman guillaume de posch said the takeover by springer " would have been a good solution .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .
" experience has shown us that deporting these women quickly is only in the best interests of the culprits . " sally beeckman , a criminologist for pag-asa in brussels who helps victims in the courts and over various administrative hurdles , confirmed that investigations depend on these witnesses and that personal testimony is important in bringing cases to trial . " it 's kind of a give and take system , " she said .
" the person agrees to make a statement and to help in the investigation and the person gets the possibility to stay here even if it 's sometimes only temporary . " i n creased protectio n n eeded european parliamentarian gröner wants to see better protection for the victims , but she would also like to see prosecutors go after the men who go to prostitutes who they know are working against their will .
she said information campaigns would help protect women and sensitize europeans about the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's red light district " the world cup gives us an opportunity to see with our own eyes that there are thousands of women here who are being forced into prostitution , " she said .
" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .
it can not act in many cases on its own , but has to first get permission from national governments , which has slowed the fight against international human trafficking . still , most aid organizations doubt that germany will change its residency laws or go on the offensive against johns , even in the lead-up to the world cup and under political pressure from brussels . but for anna , at least , the outlook is pretty positive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.02.2006 springer pulls plug on tv group takeover plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosiebensat.1 : ready for new for offers germany 's second-biggest commercial tv group , prosiebensat.1 , appeared to be up for sale again after would-be buyer , publisher axel springer , buried its ambition to take over the group in face of regulatory opposition . the prospects of a new takeover battle sent prosiebensat.1 shares sharply higher on the stock exchange .
springer , publisher of the mass-circulation daily bild , had originally signed an agreement with prosiebensat.1 's owner , us-israeli billionaire haim saban , to acquire the broadcaster for 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.0 billion -rrb- in august .
but the merger was blocked both by the media watchdog kek and the federal cartel office on the grounds that it would give springer a dominant market position in advertising and too much influence over public opinion . in face of such fierce resistance , springer announced on wednesday that it was throwing in the towel . " the management board of axel springer and p7s1 holding -lrb- the investor group led by haim saban 's saban capital group -rrb- announced today that they have mutually agreed to terminate plans for axel springer to acquire prosiebensat.1 media , " the newspaper publisher said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saban said he 'd look for alternatives to springer saban issued a statement in munich expressing " disappointment " with the development .
he was nevertheless " extremely satisfied " with the tv group 's performance and would now examine " alternatives " to the springer deal , saban said . the development means the broadcaster could find another buyer .
media reports have suggested that tf1 of france , nbc universal and viacom of the united states could now take a fresh look at the business . the prospect of a fresh takeover battle sent shares in prosiebensat.1 soaring in frankfurt .
the price of shares was showing a gain of 0.70 euros or 3.72 percent at 19.50 euros in mid-morning trade . springer drew the line initially , springer had conceded it was ready to sell one of the group 's four tv channels - the popular prosieben channel - to try and win regulatory approval for the deal .
alongside prosieben , prosiebensat.1 also owns the sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 channels .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .

" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .
it can not act in many cases on its own , but has to first get permission from national governments , which has slowed the fight against international human trafficking . still , most aid organizations doubt that germany will change its residency laws or go on the offensive against johns , even in the lead-up to the world cup and under political pressure from brussels . but for anna , at least , the outlook is pretty positive .

initially after the iron curtain fell , the german authorities wanted to replace him with the skinnier , less expressive traffic symbol used in the rest of germany .
but residents of the east founded a committee that fought hard to prevent another part of their culture from being swallowed up in the reunification process .
part of east german identity today , there are even areas in western berlin where broken traffic lights have been replaced with ones featuring the inimitable ampelmännchen . " the ossis said that one could not do away with everything that set them apart .
especially since it was something rather fun , " heckhausen told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german traffic light man 's fame is turning to notoriety . the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by traffic psychologist karl peglau after an increase in cars in east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible .
the ampelmännchen became a much-loved figure in east germany decades before he would become something of a mascot for berlin and one of the tourist attractions of the new german capital . in the 1980s , a cartoon ampelmann explained traffic rules to east german children on television and around the same time an east berlin-based businessman , joachim rossberg , began selling ampelmännchen memorabilia .
battle between east and west ?
rossberg and heckhausen are now facing each other in court , with the former accusing his rival of having infringed his patents for ampelmännchen toys and brandy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rossberg 's company also makes traffic-light women " whether people like it or not , the ampelmännchen remains a symbol of the east .
my company is the one that originally began producing memorabilia , i was doing this long before the iron curtain came down , " rossberg said . heckhausen has countered that rossberg has not exercised his patent rights for the past five years and that they have therefore passed back into the public domain .
his ampelmännchen memorabilia company employs 30 people and made some 2.4 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- in 2005 . the entrepreneur angrily rejected the picture created in the press of a greedy wessi , using the nickname for western germans , stealing from a poor ossi . " it 's a cliche .
our litigation can hardly be seen as a battle between east and west , " he said . a court in leipzig , in the east of the country , is expected to rule on the matter on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.02.2006 springer pulls plug on tv group takeover plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosiebensat.1 : ready for new for offers germany 's second-biggest commercial tv group , prosiebensat.1 , appeared to be up for sale again after would-be buyer , publisher axel springer , buried its ambition to take over the group in face of regulatory opposition . the prospects of a new takeover battle sent prosiebensat.1 shares sharply higher on the stock exchange .
springer , publisher of the mass-circulation daily bild , had originally signed an agreement with prosiebensat.1 's owner , us-israeli billionaire haim saban , to acquire the broadcaster for 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.0 billion -rrb- in august .
but the merger was blocked both by the media watchdog kek and the federal cartel office on the grounds that it would give springer a dominant market position in advertising and too much influence over public opinion . in face of such fierce resistance , springer announced on wednesday that it was throwing in the towel . " the management board of axel springer and p7s1 holding -lrb- the investor group led by haim saban 's saban capital group -rrb- announced today that they have mutually agreed to terminate plans for axel springer to acquire prosiebensat.1 media , " the newspaper publisher said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saban said he 'd look for alternatives to springer saban issued a statement in munich expressing " disappointment " with the development .
he was nevertheless " extremely satisfied " with the tv group 's performance and would now examine " alternatives " to the springer deal , saban said . the development means the broadcaster could find another buyer .
media reports have suggested that tf1 of france , nbc universal and viacom of the united states could now take a fresh look at the business . the prospect of a fresh takeover battle sent shares in prosiebensat.1 soaring in frankfurt .
the price of shares was showing a gain of 0.70 euros or 3.72 percent at 19.50 euros in mid-morning trade . springer drew the line initially , springer had conceded it was ready to sell one of the group 's four tv channels - the popular prosieben channel - to try and win regulatory approval for the deal .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .
" experience has shown us that deporting these women quickly is only in the best interests of the culprits . " sally beeckman , a criminologist for pag-asa in brussels who helps victims in the courts and over various administrative hurdles , confirmed that investigations depend on these witnesses and that personal testimony is important in bringing cases to trial . " it 's kind of a give and take system , " she said .
" the person agrees to make a statement and to help in the investigation and the person gets the possibility to stay here even if it 's sometimes only temporary . " i n creased protectio n n eeded european parliamentarian gröner wants to see better protection for the victims , but she would also like to see prosecutors go after the men who go to prostitutes who they know are working against their will .
she said information campaigns would help protect women and sensitize europeans about the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's red light district " the world cup gives us an opportunity to see with our own eyes that there are thousands of women here who are being forced into prostitution , " she said .
" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .
it can not act in many cases on its own , but has to first get permission from national governments , which has slowed the fight against international human trafficking . still , most aid organizations doubt that germany will change its residency laws or go on the offensive against johns , even in the lead-up to the world cup and under political pressure from brussels . but for anna , at least , the outlook is pretty positive .
she herself said she just wants the basics : a house to live in , a nice job and to take care of her child . " to have just a normal life , like everybody , " she said . marlis schaum -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de concerns over projected influx of prostitutes for world cup germany is braced for an influx of not only three million football fans to next year 's world cup but also thousands of illegal sex workers from eastern europe .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .
" experience has shown us that deporting these women quickly is only in the best interests of the culprits . " sally beeckman , a criminologist for pag-asa in brussels who helps victims in the courts and over various administrative hurdles , confirmed that investigations depend on these witnesses and that personal testimony is important in bringing cases to trial . " it 's kind of a give and take system , " she said .
" the person agrees to make a statement and to help in the investigation and the person gets the possibility to stay here even if it 's sometimes only temporary . " i n creased protectio n n eeded european parliamentarian gröner wants to see better protection for the victims , but she would also like to see prosecutors go after the men who go to prostitutes who they know are working against their will .
she said information campaigns would help protect women and sensitize europeans about the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's red light district " the world cup gives us an opportunity to see with our own eyes that there are thousands of women here who are being forced into prostitution , " she said .
" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .
it can not act in many cases on its own , but has to first get permission from national governments , which has slowed the fight against international human trafficking . still , most aid organizations doubt that germany will change its residency laws or go on the offensive against johns , even in the lead-up to the world cup and under political pressure from brussels . but for anna , at least , the outlook is pretty positive .
she herself said she just wants the basics : a house to live in , a nice job and to take care of her child . " to have just a normal life , like everybody , " she said . marlis schaum -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de concerns over projected influx of prostitutes for world cup germany is braced for an influx of not only three million football fans to next year 's world cup but also thousands of illegal sex workers from eastern europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.02.2006 keeping up with the pradas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has the talent to be a fashion player , but needs encouragement the week of all-night parties and forests of clothing racks known as berlin fashion week has come to an end .
the capital is a fashionista destination , but will it ever reach the iconic status of a new york or a paris ? so how big can berlin 's fashion scene get ?
as profitable as tokyo 's ?
as glamorous as new york 's ?
as legendary as paris ' ? anita bachelin smiles and then gives a half answer .
" it could be better , but in a different way , " she says .
she thumbs the dial on her blackberry in the vip lounge of the fashion trade show she and partner norbert tillman created in berlin from scratch in 2003 .
in two years , it has become the city 's biggest , joining with major-brand trade show bread & butter and three smaller trade fairs to firmly establish berlin as germany 's fashion capital . soho of europe the hype that has surrounded the city 's young design scene in recent years is the reason tens of thousands of buyers representing clients from los angeles to hong kong , international journalists and hundreds of labels have descended on berlin in the past five days . " berlin is not just fashion , it 's creativity , " says bachelin , fishing a ringing nokia out of her snakeskin purse .
" new yorkers say it ’ s the soho of europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premium has gone from 60 exhibitors in 2003 , to more than 600 this year but as the hype that has surrounded berlin 's burgeoning fashion scene inevitably fades , industry figures like bachelin and tillmann are fighting to ensure the city loses none of the traction it has gained in recent years . cheap rents and low costs of living have nurtured a booming creative scene in post-wall berlin that ranges from art to music , from film to fashion .
berlin designers sell in tokyo department stores , paris showrooms and are featured in magazine spreads .
this year , vogue doyenne anna wintour sent one of her assistants to check out the premium show , says bachelin . some way to go the growth of the city 's two big fairs has been so impressive - premium featured more than 600 exhibitors and bread & butter around 500 - that berlin city officials , who last year began sponsoring an additional trade show , have unified the shows under the title , berlin fashion week .
but if the name is supposed to invoke the glamour of milan , london and new york , the reality is different . " german fashion is not there yet , " said dylan ross , buyer for question air , which supplies stores in london .
" but its potential as a platform is enormous . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor wowereit , here with boris becker 's ex-wife , at a fashion event sunday unlike london - where the government hitched the city 's creative scene to its " cool britannia " campaign - berlin government officials have been slow to recognize the image gain and economic potential in the clothing business .
though it provides small atelier subsidies and other grants , the city has only invested 1.3 million euros in the industry between 1993 and 2005 , according to a economics ministry report .
neither premium nor bread & butter gets any financial support . " they do give us an ear , " says bachelin .

springer , publisher of the mass-circulation daily bild , had originally signed an agreement with prosiebensat.1 's owner , us-israeli billionaire haim saban , to acquire the broadcaster for 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.0 billion -rrb- in august .
but the merger was blocked both by the media watchdog kek and the federal cartel office on the grounds that it would give springer a dominant market position in advertising and too much influence over public opinion . in face of such fierce resistance , springer announced on wednesday that it was throwing in the towel . " the management board of axel springer and p7s1 holding -lrb- the investor group led by haim saban 's saban capital group -rrb- announced today that they have mutually agreed to terminate plans for axel springer to acquire prosiebensat.1 media , " the newspaper publisher said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saban said he 'd look for alternatives to springer saban issued a statement in munich expressing " disappointment " with the development .
he was nevertheless " extremely satisfied " with the tv group 's performance and would now examine " alternatives " to the springer deal , saban said . the development means the broadcaster could find another buyer .
media reports have suggested that tf1 of france , nbc universal and viacom of the united states could now take a fresh look at the business . the prospect of a fresh takeover battle sent shares in prosiebensat.1 soaring in frankfurt .
the price of shares was showing a gain of 0.70 euros or 3.72 percent at 19.50 euros in mid-morning trade . springer drew the line initially , springer had conceded it was ready to sell one of the group 's four tv channels - the popular prosieben channel - to try and win regulatory approval for the deal .
alongside prosieben , prosiebensat.1 also owns the sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 channels .
but the federal anti-trust office had insisted that prosieben be sold before the takeover , a condition springer was unwilling to fulfill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer decided it was n't worth pursuing the deal springer could have sought special permission from the government to overturn the anti-trust office 's ruling .
but after " extensive analysis and careful consideration of the possibilities for an appeal and other available options , axel springer and p7s1 holding came to the conclusion that in light of the numerous economic and legal uncertainties , a possible appeal or a possible application for a ministerial permit would have resulted in unacceptable risks for all parties involved , " the springer statement continued . " as a consequence , neither the share purchase agreement dated august 5 , 2005 , nor the voluntary public takeover offer made to the shareholders of prosiebensat.1 media will be consummated , " it concluded . prosiebensat.1 chairman guillaume de posch said the takeover by springer " would have been a good solution . "
the broadcaster would now focus on " expanding further under our own strength and concentrate on our operating business , " de posch said .

media reports have suggested that tf1 of france , nbc universal and viacom of the united states could now take a fresh look at the business . the prospect of a fresh takeover battle sent shares in prosiebensat.1 soaring in frankfurt .
the price of shares was showing a gain of 0.70 euros or 3.72 percent at 19.50 euros in mid-morning trade . springer drew the line initially , springer had conceded it was ready to sell one of the group 's four tv channels - the popular prosieben channel - to try and win regulatory approval for the deal .
alongside prosieben , prosiebensat.1 also owns the sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 channels .
but the federal anti-trust office had insisted that prosieben be sold before the takeover , a condition springer was unwilling to fulfill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer decided it was n't worth pursuing the deal springer could have sought special permission from the government to overturn the anti-trust office 's ruling .
but after " extensive analysis and careful consideration of the possibilities for an appeal and other available options , axel springer and p7s1 holding came to the conclusion that in light of the numerous economic and legal uncertainties , a possible appeal or a possible application for a ministerial permit would have resulted in unacceptable risks for all parties involved , " the springer statement continued . " as a consequence , neither the share purchase agreement dated august 5 , 2005 , nor the voluntary public takeover offer made to the shareholders of prosiebensat.1 media will be consummated , " it concluded . prosiebensat.1 chairman guillaume de posch said the takeover by springer " would have been a good solution . "
the broadcaster would now focus on " expanding further under our own strength and concentrate on our operating business , " de posch said .
" our aim is strengthen our core tv business further and to diversify sales .

initially after the iron curtain fell , the german authorities wanted to replace him with the skinnier , less expressive traffic symbol used in the rest of germany .
but residents of the east founded a committee that fought hard to prevent another part of their culture from being swallowed up in the reunification process .
part of east german identity today , there are even areas in western berlin where broken traffic lights have been replaced with ones featuring the inimitable ampelmännchen . " the ossis said that one could not do away with everything that set them apart .
especially since it was something rather fun , " heckhausen told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german traffic light man 's fame is turning to notoriety . the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by traffic psychologist karl peglau after an increase in cars in east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible .
the ampelmännchen became a much-loved figure in east germany decades before he would become something of a mascot for berlin and one of the tourist attractions of the new german capital . in the 1980s , a cartoon ampelmann explained traffic rules to east german children on television and around the same time an east berlin-based businessman , joachim rossberg , began selling ampelmännchen memorabilia .
battle between east and west ?
rossberg and heckhausen are now facing each other in court , with the former accusing his rival of having infringed his patents for ampelmännchen toys and brandy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rossberg 's company also makes traffic-light women " whether people like it or not , the ampelmännchen remains a symbol of the east .
my company is the one that originally began producing memorabilia , i was doing this long before the iron curtain came down , " rossberg said . heckhausen has countered that rossberg has not exercised his patent rights for the past five years and that they have therefore passed back into the public domain .
his ampelmännchen memorabilia company employs 30 people and made some 2.4 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- in 2005 . the entrepreneur angrily rejected the picture created in the press of a greedy wessi , using the nickname for western germans , stealing from a poor ossi . " it 's a cliche .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .
" experience has shown us that deporting these women quickly is only in the best interests of the culprits . " sally beeckman , a criminologist for pag-asa in brussels who helps victims in the courts and over various administrative hurdles , confirmed that investigations depend on these witnesses and that personal testimony is important in bringing cases to trial . " it 's kind of a give and take system , " she said .
" the person agrees to make a statement and to help in the investigation and the person gets the possibility to stay here even if it 's sometimes only temporary . " i n creased protectio n n eeded european parliamentarian gröner wants to see better protection for the victims , but she would also like to see prosecutors go after the men who go to prostitutes who they know are working against their will .
she said information campaigns would help protect women and sensitize europeans about the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's red light district " the world cup gives us an opportunity to see with our own eyes that there are thousands of women here who are being forced into prostitution , " she said .
" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .
it can not act in many cases on its own , but has to first get permission from national governments , which has slowed the fight against international human trafficking . still , most aid organizations doubt that germany will change its residency laws or go on the offensive against johns , even in the lead-up to the world cup and under political pressure from brussels . but for anna , at least , the outlook is pretty positive .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .
" experience has shown us that deporting these women quickly is only in the best interests of the culprits . " sally beeckman , a criminologist for pag-asa in brussels who helps victims in the courts and over various administrative hurdles , confirmed that investigations depend on these witnesses and that personal testimony is important in bringing cases to trial . " it 's kind of a give and take system , " she said .
" the person agrees to make a statement and to help in the investigation and the person gets the possibility to stay here even if it 's sometimes only temporary . " i n creased protectio n n eeded european parliamentarian gröner wants to see better protection for the victims , but she would also like to see prosecutors go after the men who go to prostitutes who they know are working against their will .
she said information campaigns would help protect women and sensitize europeans about the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's red light district " the world cup gives us an opportunity to see with our own eyes that there are thousands of women here who are being forced into prostitution , " she said .
" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .
it can not act in many cases on its own , but has to first get permission from national governments , which has slowed the fight against international human trafficking . still , most aid organizations doubt that germany will change its residency laws or go on the offensive against johns , even in the lead-up to the world cup and under political pressure from brussels . but for anna , at least , the outlook is pretty positive .

the winter months in germany give little reason to smile .
but by the time the summer and world cup rolls around , that should change : a three million euro friendliness campaign wants to guarantee it . tourists trying to flash a smile at the check-out girl at a german supermarket , or the deutsche bahn employee behind the train station counter are often met with blank stares . locals will claim that progress has been made in the german service mentality in recent years .
but most , including the world cup organizing committee , admit there 's still a ways to go . in early december franz beckenbauer and co. launched a three million euro -lrb- $ 3.5 million -rrb- " friendliness " campaign designed to infuse the german service and tourism industry with the smiles needed to deal with the estimated one million fans that will travel to germany for the world cup . sponsored by economics and technology ministry and the interior ministry the campaign is designed to quash the image of germany as a service wasteland , say organizers . 850 million reasons why " we wo n't get this opportunity again for another 50 years so it 's worth at least smiling for a few weeks , " said beckenbauer , the head of germany 's world cup organizing committee at the launch of the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckenbauer : smile at least for a few weeks organizers estimate that visitors will spend 850 million euros during the four-week world cup , from june 9 to july 9 .
the tourism industry is expecting 5 million additional overnight stays in the 12 world cup host cities . " we need to use the chance the world cup is giving us , so that people come again , " said economics minister michael glos . berlin 's efforts placards of smiling german personalities have already begun going up around the world cup cities .
service and transportation industry personnel will be given special training to answer world cup-related questions .

" skinny madness , " screamed the daily bild , the country 's top selling newspaper .
" do you want that , heidi klum ? " it asked , next to pictures of an anorexic 19-year-old named lisa pitney and klum herself in a string bikini . pitney , who was not a contestant on the show , told bild that she had always " admired " klum .
but she warned that " germany 's next top model , " in which a group of attractive young women are weeded out by a jury until one wins a modeling contract , was dangerous . " this show is simply awful , " she said .
" this is what destroys young girls and drives them to an obsession with being thin .

the capital is a fashionista destination , but will it ever reach the iconic status of a new york or a paris ? so how big can berlin 's fashion scene get ?
as profitable as tokyo 's ?
as glamorous as new york 's ?
as legendary as paris ' ? anita bachelin smiles and then gives a half answer .
" it could be better , but in a different way , " she says .
she thumbs the dial on her blackberry in the vip lounge of the fashion trade show she and partner norbert tillman created in berlin from scratch in 2003 .
in two years , it has become the city 's biggest , joining with major-brand trade show bread & butter and three smaller trade fairs to firmly establish berlin as germany 's fashion capital . soho of europe the hype that has surrounded the city 's young design scene in recent years is the reason tens of thousands of buyers representing clients from los angeles to hong kong , international journalists and hundreds of labels have descended on berlin in the past five days . " berlin is not just fashion , it 's creativity , " says bachelin , fishing a ringing nokia out of her snakeskin purse .
" new yorkers say it ’ s the soho of europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premium has gone from 60 exhibitors in 2003 , to more than 600 this year but as the hype that has surrounded berlin 's burgeoning fashion scene inevitably fades , industry figures like bachelin and tillmann are fighting to ensure the city loses none of the traction it has gained in recent years . cheap rents and low costs of living have nurtured a booming creative scene in post-wall berlin that ranges from art to music , from film to fashion .
berlin designers sell in tokyo department stores , paris showrooms and are featured in magazine spreads .
this year , vogue doyenne anna wintour sent one of her assistants to check out the premium show , says bachelin . some way to go the growth of the city 's two big fairs has been so impressive - premium featured more than 600 exhibitors and bread & butter around 500 - that berlin city officials , who last year began sponsoring an additional trade show , have unified the shows under the title , berlin fashion week .
but if the name is supposed to invoke the glamour of milan , london and new york , the reality is different . " german fashion is not there yet , " said dylan ross , buyer for question air , which supplies stores in london .
" but its potential as a platform is enormous . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor wowereit , here with boris becker 's ex-wife , at a fashion event sunday unlike london - where the government hitched the city 's creative scene to its " cool britannia " campaign - berlin government officials have been slow to recognize the image gain and economic potential in the clothing business .
though it provides small atelier subsidies and other grants , the city has only invested 1.3 million euros in the industry between 1993 and 2005 , according to a economics ministry report .
neither premium nor bread & butter gets any financial support . " they do give us an ear , " says bachelin .
" but we 're -lrb- the ones -rrb- promoting berlin . " a unified effort things are beginning to change .
city officials like the city 's economics senator and mayor klaus wowereit are now trade show regulars , with wowereit giving a speech of thanks -lrb- in english -rrb- at an adidas originals runway show on sunday night .
the berlin trade show association started the " b in berlin " trade show in january 2005 , and joined with premium and new show " fifth floor " to form the " berlin fashion week " event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bread & butter catwalk show from the weekend but state support alone wo n't help . markus klosseck , designer and president of the label aemkei moved his company to berlin from new york two years ago .
though benefiting from the city 's cheap rents and its central european location , he thinks there needs to be more investment in retail and more cooperation between the various trade shows before berlin can be mentioned in the same breath as new york , london or tokyo . " what they 're doing now is not helping the buyer , " he said .
" there 's too many trade shows , too many events and the -lrb- buyers -rrb- are confused . " expansion plans bachelin says to be patient . “ it ’ s still coming , " she said .
" we ’ re talking about 3.5 years !
new york had ten years and paris had 100 years to establish itself . " for the time being , all bachelin and her colleagues can continue to do is spread berlin 's good reputation .
bread & butter last year launched a barcelona event that attracted 48,000 people during its first weekend .
in the coming weeks , premium will take seven berlin designers to milan and tokyo to feature in trade shows there .
" times are changing , " says bachelin . maybe berlin 's fashion status will as well . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star designer leaves berlin sometimes she made her students cry , but she also inspired them to be bold and inventive .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .
" experience has shown us that deporting these women quickly is only in the best interests of the culprits . " sally beeckman , a criminologist for pag-asa in brussels who helps victims in the courts and over various administrative hurdles , confirmed that investigations depend on these witnesses and that personal testimony is important in bringing cases to trial . " it 's kind of a give and take system , " she said .
" the person agrees to make a statement and to help in the investigation and the person gets the possibility to stay here even if it 's sometimes only temporary . " i n creased protectio n n eeded european parliamentarian gröner wants to see better protection for the victims , but she would also like to see prosecutors go after the men who go to prostitutes who they know are working against their will .
she said information campaigns would help protect women and sensitize europeans about the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's red light district " the world cup gives us an opportunity to see with our own eyes that there are thousands of women here who are being forced into prostitution , " she said .
" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .
" experience has shown us that deporting these women quickly is only in the best interests of the culprits . " sally beeckman , a criminologist for pag-asa in brussels who helps victims in the courts and over various administrative hurdles , confirmed that investigations depend on these witnesses and that personal testimony is important in bringing cases to trial . " it 's kind of a give and take system , " she said .
" the person agrees to make a statement and to help in the investigation and the person gets the possibility to stay here even if it 's sometimes only temporary . " i n creased protectio n n eeded european parliamentarian gröner wants to see better protection for the victims , but she would also like to see prosecutors go after the men who go to prostitutes who they know are working against their will .
she said information campaigns would help protect women and sensitize europeans about the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's red light district " the world cup gives us an opportunity to see with our own eyes that there are thousands of women here who are being forced into prostitution , " she said .
" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .
" experience has shown us that deporting these women quickly is only in the best interests of the culprits . " sally beeckman , a criminologist for pag-asa in brussels who helps victims in the courts and over various administrative hurdles , confirmed that investigations depend on these witnesses and that personal testimony is important in bringing cases to trial . " it 's kind of a give and take system , " she said .
" the person agrees to make a statement and to help in the investigation and the person gets the possibility to stay here even if it 's sometimes only temporary . " i n creased protectio n n eeded european parliamentarian gröner wants to see better protection for the victims , but she would also like to see prosecutors go after the men who go to prostitutes who they know are working against their will .
she said information campaigns would help protect women and sensitize europeans about the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's red light district " the world cup gives us an opportunity to see with our own eyes that there are thousands of women here who are being forced into prostitution , " she said .
" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .
it can not act in many cases on its own , but has to first get permission from national governments , which has slowed the fight against international human trafficking . still , most aid organizations doubt that germany will change its residency laws or go on the offensive against johns , even in the lead-up to the world cup and under political pressure from brussels . but for anna , at least , the outlook is pretty positive .
she herself said she just wants the basics : a house to live in , a nice job and to take care of her child .

the capital is a fashionista destination , but will it ever reach the iconic status of a new york or a paris ? so how big can berlin 's fashion scene get ?
as profitable as tokyo 's ?
as glamorous as new york 's ?
as legendary as paris ' ? anita bachelin smiles and then gives a half answer .
" it could be better , but in a different way , " she says .
she thumbs the dial on her blackberry in the vip lounge of the fashion trade show she and partner norbert tillman created in berlin from scratch in 2003 .
in two years , it has become the city 's biggest , joining with major-brand trade show bread & butter and three smaller trade fairs to firmly establish berlin as germany 's fashion capital . soho of europe the hype that has surrounded the city 's young design scene in recent years is the reason tens of thousands of buyers representing clients from los angeles to hong kong , international journalists and hundreds of labels have descended on berlin in the past five days . " berlin is not just fashion , it 's creativity , " says bachelin , fishing a ringing nokia out of her snakeskin purse .
" new yorkers say it ’ s the soho of europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premium has gone from 60 exhibitors in 2003 , to more than 600 this year but as the hype that has surrounded berlin 's burgeoning fashion scene inevitably fades , industry figures like bachelin and tillmann are fighting to ensure the city loses none of the traction it has gained in recent years . cheap rents and low costs of living have nurtured a booming creative scene in post-wall berlin that ranges from art to music , from film to fashion .
berlin designers sell in tokyo department stores , paris showrooms and are featured in magazine spreads .
this year , vogue doyenne anna wintour sent one of her assistants to check out the premium show , says bachelin . some way to go the growth of the city 's two big fairs has been so impressive - premium featured more than 600 exhibitors and bread & butter around 500 - that berlin city officials , who last year began sponsoring an additional trade show , have unified the shows under the title , berlin fashion week .
but if the name is supposed to invoke the glamour of milan , london and new york , the reality is different . " german fashion is not there yet , " said dylan ross , buyer for question air , which supplies stores in london .
" but its potential as a platform is enormous . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor wowereit , here with boris becker 's ex-wife , at a fashion event sunday unlike london - where the government hitched the city 's creative scene to its " cool britannia " campaign - berlin government officials have been slow to recognize the image gain and economic potential in the clothing business .
though it provides small atelier subsidies and other grants , the city has only invested 1.3 million euros in the industry between 1993 and 2005 , according to a economics ministry report .
neither premium nor bread & butter gets any financial support . " they do give us an ear , " says bachelin .
" but we 're -lrb- the ones -rrb- promoting berlin . " a unified effort things are beginning to change .
city officials like the city 's economics senator and mayor klaus wowereit are now trade show regulars , with wowereit giving a speech of thanks -lrb- in english -rrb- at an adidas originals runway show on sunday night .
the berlin trade show association started the " b in berlin " trade show in january 2005 , and joined with premium and new show " fifth floor " to form the " berlin fashion week " event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bread & butter catwalk show from the weekend but state support alone wo n't help . markus klosseck , designer and president of the label aemkei moved his company to berlin from new york two years ago .
though benefiting from the city 's cheap rents and its central european location , he thinks there needs to be more investment in retail and more cooperation between the various trade shows before berlin can be mentioned in the same breath as new york , london or tokyo . " what they 're doing now is not helping the buyer , " he said .
" there 's too many trade shows , too many events and the -lrb- buyers -rrb- are confused . " expansion plans bachelin says to be patient . “ it ’ s still coming , " she said .
" we ’ re talking about 3.5 years !
new york had ten years and paris had 100 years to establish itself . " for the time being , all bachelin and her colleagues can continue to do is spread berlin 's good reputation .
bread & butter last year launched a barcelona event that attracted 48,000 people during its first weekend .
in the coming weeks , premium will take seven berlin designers to milan and tokyo to feature in trade shows there .
" times are changing , " says bachelin . maybe berlin 's fashion status will as well . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star designer leaves berlin sometimes she made her students cry , but she also inspired them to be bold and inventive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.02.2006 springer pulls plug on tv group takeover plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosiebensat.1 : ready for new for offers germany 's second-biggest commercial tv group , prosiebensat.1 , appeared to be up for sale again after would-be buyer , publisher axel springer , buried its ambition to take over the group in face of regulatory opposition . the prospects of a new takeover battle sent prosiebensat.1 shares sharply higher on the stock exchange .
springer , publisher of the mass-circulation daily bild , had originally signed an agreement with prosiebensat.1 's owner , us-israeli billionaire haim saban , to acquire the broadcaster for 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.0 billion -rrb- in august .
but the merger was blocked both by the media watchdog kek and the federal cartel office on the grounds that it would give springer a dominant market position in advertising and too much influence over public opinion . in face of such fierce resistance , springer announced on wednesday that it was throwing in the towel . " the management board of axel springer and p7s1 holding -lrb- the investor group led by haim saban 's saban capital group -rrb- announced today that they have mutually agreed to terminate plans for axel springer to acquire prosiebensat.1 media , " the newspaper publisher said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saban said he 'd look for alternatives to springer saban issued a statement in munich expressing " disappointment " with the development .
he was nevertheless " extremely satisfied " with the tv group 's performance and would now examine " alternatives " to the springer deal , saban said . the development means the broadcaster could find another buyer .
media reports have suggested that tf1 of france , nbc universal and viacom of the united states could now take a fresh look at the business . the prospect of a fresh takeover battle sent shares in prosiebensat.1 soaring in frankfurt .
the price of shares was showing a gain of 0.70 euros or 3.72 percent at 19.50 euros in mid-morning trade . springer drew the line initially , springer had conceded it was ready to sell one of the group 's four tv channels - the popular prosieben channel - to try and win regulatory approval for the deal .
alongside prosieben , prosiebensat.1 also owns the sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 channels .
but the federal anti-trust office had insisted that prosieben be sold before the takeover , a condition springer was unwilling to fulfill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer decided it was n't worth pursuing the deal springer could have sought special permission from the government to overturn the anti-trust office 's ruling .
but after " extensive analysis and careful consideration of the possibilities for an appeal and other available options , axel springer and p7s1 holding came to the conclusion that in light of the numerous economic and legal uncertainties , a possible appeal or a possible application for a ministerial permit would have resulted in unacceptable risks for all parties involved , " the springer statement continued . " as a consequence , neither the share purchase agreement dated august 5 , 2005 , nor the voluntary public takeover offer made to the shareholders of prosiebensat.1 media will be consummated , " it concluded . prosiebensat.1 chairman guillaume de posch said the takeover by springer " would have been a good solution . "
the broadcaster would now focus on " expanding further under our own strength and concentrate on our operating business , " de posch said .
" our aim is strengthen our core tv business further and to diversify sales .

springer , publisher of the mass-circulation daily bild , had originally signed an agreement with prosiebensat.1 's owner , us-israeli billionaire haim saban , to acquire the broadcaster for 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.0 billion -rrb- in august .
but the merger was blocked both by the media watchdog kek and the federal cartel office on the grounds that it would give springer a dominant market position in advertising and too much influence over public opinion . in face of such fierce resistance , springer announced on wednesday that it was throwing in the towel . " the management board of axel springer and p7s1 holding -lrb- the investor group led by haim saban 's saban capital group -rrb- announced today that they have mutually agreed to terminate plans for axel springer to acquire prosiebensat.1 media , " the newspaper publisher said in a statement .

springer , publisher of the mass-circulation daily bild , had originally signed an agreement with prosiebensat.1 's owner , us-israeli billionaire haim saban , to acquire the broadcaster for 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.0 billion -rrb- in august .
but the merger was blocked both by the media watchdog kek and the federal cartel office on the grounds that it would give springer a dominant market position in advertising and too much influence over public opinion . in face of such fierce resistance , springer announced on wednesday that it was throwing in the towel . " the management board of axel springer and p7s1 holding -lrb- the investor group led by haim saban 's saban capital group -rrb- announced today that they have mutually agreed to terminate plans for axel springer to acquire prosiebensat.1 media , " the newspaper publisher said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saban said he 'd look for alternatives to springer saban issued a statement in munich expressing " disappointment " with the development .
he was nevertheless " extremely satisfied " with the tv group 's performance and would now examine " alternatives " to the springer deal , saban said . the development means the broadcaster could find another buyer .
media reports have suggested that tf1 of france , nbc universal and viacom of the united states could now take a fresh look at the business . the prospect of a fresh takeover battle sent shares in prosiebensat.1 soaring in frankfurt .
the price of shares was showing a gain of 0.70 euros or 3.72 percent at 19.50 euros in mid-morning trade . springer drew the line initially , springer had conceded it was ready to sell one of the group 's four tv channels - the popular prosieben channel - to try and win regulatory approval for the deal .
alongside prosieben , prosiebensat.1 also owns the sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 channels .
but the federal anti-trust office had insisted that prosieben be sold before the takeover , a condition springer was unwilling to fulfill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer decided it was n't worth pursuing the deal springer could have sought special permission from the government to overturn the anti-trust office 's ruling .
but after " extensive analysis and careful consideration of the possibilities for an appeal and other available options , axel springer and p7s1 holding came to the conclusion that in light of the numerous economic and legal uncertainties , a possible appeal or a possible application for a ministerial permit would have resulted in unacceptable risks for all parties involved , " the springer statement continued . " as a consequence , neither the share purchase agreement dated august 5 , 2005 , nor the voluntary public takeover offer made to the shareholders of prosiebensat.1 media will be consummated , " it concluded . prosiebensat.1 chairman guillaume de posch said the takeover by springer " would have been a good solution .

initially after the iron curtain fell , the german authorities wanted to replace him with the skinnier , less expressive traffic symbol used in the rest of germany .
but residents of the east founded a committee that fought hard to prevent another part of their culture from being swallowed up in the reunification process .
part of east german identity today , there are even areas in western berlin where broken traffic lights have been replaced with ones featuring the inimitable ampelmännchen . " the ossis said that one could not do away with everything that set them apart .
especially since it was something rather fun , " heckhausen told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german traffic light man 's fame is turning to notoriety . the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by traffic psychologist karl peglau after an increase in cars in east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible .
the ampelmännchen became a much-loved figure in east germany decades before he would become something of a mascot for berlin and one of the tourist attractions of the new german capital . in the 1980s , a cartoon ampelmann explained traffic rules to east german children on television and around the same time an east berlin-based businessman , joachim rossberg , began selling ampelmännchen memorabilia .

my company is the one that originally began producing memorabilia , i was doing this long before the iron curtain came down , " rossberg said . heckhausen has countered that rossberg has not exercised his patent rights for the past five years and that they have therefore passed back into the public domain .
his ampelmännchen memorabilia company employs 30 people and made some 2.4 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- in 2005 . the entrepreneur angrily rejected the picture created in the press of a greedy wessi , using the nickname for western germans , stealing from a poor ossi . " it 's a cliche .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.02.2006 springer pulls plug on tv group takeover plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosiebensat.1 : ready for new for offers germany 's second-biggest commercial tv group , prosiebensat.1 , appeared to be up for sale again after would-be buyer , publisher axel springer , buried its ambition to take over the group in face of regulatory opposition . the prospects of a new takeover battle sent prosiebensat.1 shares sharply higher on the stock exchange .
springer , publisher of the mass-circulation daily bild , had originally signed an agreement with prosiebensat.1 's owner , us-israeli billionaire haim saban , to acquire the broadcaster for 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.0 billion -rrb- in august .
but the merger was blocked both by the media watchdog kek and the federal cartel office on the grounds that it would give springer a dominant market position in advertising and too much influence over public opinion . in face of such fierce resistance , springer announced on wednesday that it was throwing in the towel . " the management board of axel springer and p7s1 holding -lrb- the investor group led by haim saban 's saban capital group -rrb- announced today that they have mutually agreed to terminate plans for axel springer to acquire prosiebensat.1 media , " the newspaper publisher said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saban said he 'd look for alternatives to springer saban issued a statement in munich expressing " disappointment " with the development .
he was nevertheless " extremely satisfied " with the tv group 's performance and would now examine " alternatives " to the springer deal , saban said . the development means the broadcaster could find another buyer .
media reports have suggested that tf1 of france , nbc universal and viacom of the united states could now take a fresh look at the business . the prospect of a fresh takeover battle sent shares in prosiebensat.1 soaring in frankfurt .
the price of shares was showing a gain of 0.70 euros or 3.72 percent at 19.50 euros in mid-morning trade . springer drew the line initially , springer had conceded it was ready to sell one of the group 's four tv channels - the popular prosieben channel - to try and win regulatory approval for the deal .
alongside prosieben , prosiebensat.1 also owns the sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 channels .
but the federal anti-trust office had insisted that prosieben be sold before the takeover , a condition springer was unwilling to fulfill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer decided it was n't worth pursuing the deal springer could have sought special permission from the government to overturn the anti-trust office 's ruling .
but after " extensive analysis and careful consideration of the possibilities for an appeal and other available options , axel springer and p7s1 holding came to the conclusion that in light of the numerous economic and legal uncertainties , a possible appeal or a possible application for a ministerial permit would have resulted in unacceptable risks for all parties involved , " the springer statement continued . " as a consequence , neither the share purchase agreement dated august 5 , 2005 , nor the voluntary public takeover offer made to the shareholders of prosiebensat.1 media will be consummated , " it concluded . prosiebensat.1 chairman guillaume de posch said the takeover by springer " would have been a good solution . "
the broadcaster would now focus on " expanding further under our own strength and concentrate on our operating business , " de posch said .
" our aim is strengthen our core tv business further and to diversify sales .

springer , publisher of the mass-circulation daily bild , had originally signed an agreement with prosiebensat.1 's owner , us-israeli billionaire haim saban , to acquire the broadcaster for 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.0 billion -rrb- in august .
but the merger was blocked both by the media watchdog kek and the federal cartel office on the grounds that it would give springer a dominant market position in advertising and too much influence over public opinion . in face of such fierce resistance , springer announced on wednesday that it was throwing in the towel . " the management board of axel springer and p7s1 holding -lrb- the investor group led by haim saban 's saban capital group -rrb- announced today that they have mutually agreed to terminate plans for axel springer to acquire prosiebensat.1 media , " the newspaper publisher said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saban said he 'd look for alternatives to springer saban issued a statement in munich expressing " disappointment " with the development .
he was nevertheless " extremely satisfied " with the tv group 's performance and would now examine " alternatives " to the springer deal , saban said . the development means the broadcaster could find another buyer .
media reports have suggested that tf1 of france , nbc universal and viacom of the united states could now take a fresh look at the business . the prospect of a fresh takeover battle sent shares in prosiebensat.1 soaring in frankfurt .
the price of shares was showing a gain of 0.70 euros or 3.72 percent at 19.50 euros in mid-morning trade . springer drew the line initially , springer had conceded it was ready to sell one of the group 's four tv channels - the popular prosieben channel - to try and win regulatory approval for the deal .
alongside prosieben , prosiebensat.1 also owns the sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 channels .
but the federal anti-trust office had insisted that prosieben be sold before the takeover , a condition springer was unwilling to fulfill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer decided it was n't worth pursuing the deal springer could have sought special permission from the government to overturn the anti-trust office 's ruling .
but after " extensive analysis and careful consideration of the possibilities for an appeal and other available options , axel springer and p7s1 holding came to the conclusion that in light of the numerous economic and legal uncertainties , a possible appeal or a possible application for a ministerial permit would have resulted in unacceptable risks for all parties involved , " the springer statement continued . " as a consequence , neither the share purchase agreement dated august 5 , 2005 , nor the voluntary public takeover offer made to the shareholders of prosiebensat.1 media will be consummated , " it concluded . prosiebensat.1 chairman guillaume de posch said the takeover by springer " would have been a good solution . "
the broadcaster would now focus on " expanding further under our own strength and concentrate on our operating business , " de posch said .
" our aim is strengthen our core tv business further and to diversify sales .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .
" experience has shown us that deporting these women quickly is only in the best interests of the culprits . " sally beeckman , a criminologist for pag-asa in brussels who helps victims in the courts and over various administrative hurdles , confirmed that investigations depend on these witnesses and that personal testimony is important in bringing cases to trial . " it 's kind of a give and take system , " she said .
" the person agrees to make a statement and to help in the investigation and the person gets the possibility to stay here even if it 's sometimes only temporary . " i n creased protectio n n eeded european parliamentarian gröner wants to see better protection for the victims , but she would also like to see prosecutors go after the men who go to prostitutes who they know are working against their will .
she said information campaigns would help protect women and sensitize europeans about the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's red light district " the world cup gives us an opportunity to see with our own eyes that there are thousands of women here who are being forced into prostitution , " she said .
" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .
it can not act in many cases on its own , but has to first get permission from national governments , which has slowed the fight against international human trafficking . still , most aid organizations doubt that germany will change its residency laws or go on the offensive against johns , even in the lead-up to the world cup and under political pressure from brussels . but for anna , at least , the outlook is pretty positive .

but many prostitutes wo n't be working by choice .
the eu says germany should do more about this . anna is bulgarian , 20 years old , and until recently worked in brussels , but not because she wants to .
she was brought here three years ago against her will and forced to work as a prostitute .
just last month , she was finally able to escape the men who kept her prisoner .
the police brought to her to pag-asa , an organization who helps the victims of human trafficking . " it 's a hard period for me but pag-asa is doing their best to help me and people like me , " she said .
" i feel good here and i think things are going to change . " the chances of anna 's life taking a turn for the better improved substantially when she agreed to testify in court against those who kept her here .
as long as the investigation continues , belgian authorities will allow anna to stay in the country , take language courses and work .
if the court recognizes her as a victim of human trafficking , she can apply for a permanent belgian residency permit .
such provisions are nearly unique in europe ; only italy has similar regulations . harder i n germa n y in most of the federal states in germany , for example , anna would have less of a chance to stay .
according to lissy gröner , a social democratic member of the european parliament , germany needs to improve its protections for victims of human trafficking - especially in the lead-up to the world cup , where it is estimated up to 40,000 prostitutes will travel to germany , thousands of them against their will . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an influx of up to 40,000 prostitutes is expected during the world cup " if a woman is ready to testify , she has to be protected in the country where she is seeking refuge , " she said .
" experience has shown us that deporting these women quickly is only in the best interests of the culprits . " sally beeckman , a criminologist for pag-asa in brussels who helps victims in the courts and over various administrative hurdles , confirmed that investigations depend on these witnesses and that personal testimony is important in bringing cases to trial . " it 's kind of a give and take system , " she said .
" the person agrees to make a statement and to help in the investigation and the person gets the possibility to stay here even if it 's sometimes only temporary . " i n creased protectio n n eeded european parliamentarian gröner wants to see better protection for the victims , but she would also like to see prosecutors go after the men who go to prostitutes who they know are working against their will .
she said information campaigns would help protect women and sensitize europeans about the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's red light district " the world cup gives us an opportunity to see with our own eyes that there are thousands of women here who are being forced into prostitution , " she said .
" justice ministers , european commission heads and even the european parliament , do n't close your eyes ! " but the issue of forced prostitution is politically sensitive and the problem is seen differently in different eu member states .
often in eastern european countries , where there are fewer women in political positions , the issue often gets put on the back burner , or not taken very seriously . that poses a problem for europol , the european policing authority .
it can not act in many cases on its own , but has to first get permission from national governments , which has slowed the fight against international human trafficking . still , most aid organizations doubt that germany will change its residency laws or go on the offensive against johns , even in the lead-up to the world cup and under political pressure from brussels . but for anna , at least , the outlook is pretty positive .

springer , publisher of the mass-circulation daily bild , had originally signed an agreement with prosiebensat.1 's owner , us-israeli billionaire haim saban , to acquire the broadcaster for 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.0 billion -rrb- in august .
but the merger was blocked both by the media watchdog kek and the federal cartel office on the grounds that it would give springer a dominant market position in advertising and too much influence over public opinion . in face of such fierce resistance , springer announced on wednesday that it was throwing in the towel . " the management board of axel springer and p7s1 holding -lrb- the investor group led by haim saban 's saban capital group -rrb- announced today that they have mutually agreed to terminate plans for axel springer to acquire prosiebensat.1 media , " the newspaper publisher said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saban said he 'd look for alternatives to springer saban issued a statement in munich expressing " disappointment " with the development .
he was nevertheless " extremely satisfied " with the tv group 's performance and would now examine " alternatives " to the springer deal , saban said . the development means the broadcaster could find another buyer .
media reports have suggested that tf1 of france , nbc universal and viacom of the united states could now take a fresh look at the business . the prospect of a fresh takeover battle sent shares in prosiebensat.1 soaring in frankfurt .
the price of shares was showing a gain of 0.70 euros or 3.72 percent at 19.50 euros in mid-morning trade . springer drew the line initially , springer had conceded it was ready to sell one of the group 's four tv channels - the popular prosieben channel - to try and win regulatory approval for the deal .
alongside prosieben , prosiebensat.1 also owns the sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 channels .
but the federal anti-trust office had insisted that prosieben be sold before the takeover , a condition springer was unwilling to fulfill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer decided it was n't worth pursuing the deal springer could have sought special permission from the government to overturn the anti-trust office 's ruling .
but after " extensive analysis and careful consideration of the possibilities for an appeal and other available options , axel springer and p7s1 holding came to the conclusion that in light of the numerous economic and legal uncertainties , a possible appeal or a possible application for a ministerial permit would have resulted in unacceptable risks for all parties involved , " the springer statement continued . " as a consequence , neither the share purchase agreement dated august 5 , 2005 , nor the voluntary public takeover offer made to the shareholders of prosiebensat.1 media will be consummated , " it concluded . prosiebensat.1 chairman guillaume de posch said the takeover by springer " would have been a good solution . "
the broadcaster would now focus on " expanding further under our own strength and concentrate on our operating business , " de posch said .
" our aim is strengthen our core tv business further and to diversify sales .

springer , publisher of the mass-circulation daily bild , had originally signed an agreement with prosiebensat.1 's owner , us-israeli billionaire haim saban , to acquire the broadcaster for 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.0 billion -rrb- in august .
but the merger was blocked both by the media watchdog kek and the federal cartel office on the grounds that it would give springer a dominant market position in advertising and too much influence over public opinion . in face of such fierce resistance , springer announced on wednesday that it was throwing in the towel . " the management board of axel springer and p7s1 holding -lrb- the investor group led by haim saban 's saban capital group -rrb- announced today that they have mutually agreed to terminate plans for axel springer to acquire prosiebensat.1 media , " the newspaper publisher said in a statement .

media reports have suggested that tf1 of france , nbc universal and viacom of the united states could now take a fresh look at the business . the prospect of a fresh takeover battle sent shares in prosiebensat.1 soaring in frankfurt .
the price of shares was showing a gain of 0.70 euros or 3.72 percent at 19.50 euros in mid-morning trade . springer drew the line initially , springer had conceded it was ready to sell one of the group 's four tv channels - the popular prosieben channel - to try and win regulatory approval for the deal .
alongside prosieben , prosiebensat.1 also owns the sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 channels .
but the federal anti-trust office had insisted that prosieben be sold before the takeover , a condition springer was unwilling to fulfill .

but after " extensive analysis and careful consideration of the possibilities for an appeal and other available options , axel springer and p7s1 holding came to the conclusion that in light of the numerous economic and legal uncertainties , a possible appeal or a possible application for a ministerial permit would have resulted in unacceptable risks for all parties involved , " the springer statement continued . " as a consequence , neither the share purchase agreement dated august 5 , 2005 , nor the voluntary public takeover offer made to the shareholders of prosiebensat.1 media will be consummated , " it concluded . prosiebensat.1 chairman guillaume de posch said the takeover by springer " would have been a good solution .

the capital is a fashionista destination , but will it ever reach the iconic status of a new york or a paris ? so how big can berlin 's fashion scene get ?
as profitable as tokyo 's ?
as glamorous as new york 's ?
as legendary as paris ' ? anita bachelin smiles and then gives a half answer .
" it could be better , but in a different way , " she says .
she thumbs the dial on her blackberry in the vip lounge of the fashion trade show she and partner norbert tillman created in berlin from scratch in 2003 .
in two years , it has become the city 's biggest , joining with major-brand trade show bread & butter and three smaller trade fairs to firmly establish berlin as germany 's fashion capital . soho of europe the hype that has surrounded the city 's young design scene in recent years is the reason tens of thousands of buyers representing clients from los angeles to hong kong , international journalists and hundreds of labels have descended on berlin in the past five days . " berlin is not just fashion , it 's creativity , " says bachelin , fishing a ringing nokia out of her snakeskin purse .
" new yorkers say it ’ s the soho of europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premium has gone from 60 exhibitors in 2003 , to more than 600 this year but as the hype that has surrounded berlin 's burgeoning fashion scene inevitably fades , industry figures like bachelin and tillmann are fighting to ensure the city loses none of the traction it has gained in recent years . cheap rents and low costs of living have nurtured a booming creative scene in post-wall berlin that ranges from art to music , from film to fashion .
berlin designers sell in tokyo department stores , paris showrooms and are featured in magazine spreads .
this year , vogue doyenne anna wintour sent one of her assistants to check out the premium show , says bachelin . some way to go the growth of the city 's two big fairs has been so impressive - premium featured more than 600 exhibitors and bread & butter around 500 - that berlin city officials , who last year began sponsoring an additional trade show , have unified the shows under the title , berlin fashion week .
but if the name is supposed to invoke the glamour of milan , london and new york , the reality is different . " german fashion is not there yet , " said dylan ross , buyer for question air , which supplies stores in london .
" but its potential as a platform is enormous . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor wowereit , here with boris becker 's ex-wife , at a fashion event sunday unlike london - where the government hitched the city 's creative scene to its " cool britannia " campaign - berlin government officials have been slow to recognize the image gain and economic potential in the clothing business .
though it provides small atelier subsidies and other grants , the city has only invested 1.3 million euros in the industry between 1993 and 2005 , according to a economics ministry report .
neither premium nor bread & butter gets any financial support . " they do give us an ear , " says bachelin .
" but we 're -lrb- the ones -rrb- promoting berlin . " a unified effort things are beginning to change .
city officials like the city 's economics senator and mayor klaus wowereit are now trade show regulars , with wowereit giving a speech of thanks -lrb- in english -rrb- at an adidas originals runway show on sunday night .
the berlin trade show association started the " b in berlin " trade show in january 2005 , and joined with premium and new show " fifth floor " to form the " berlin fashion week " event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bread & butter catwalk show from the weekend but state support alone wo n't help . markus klosseck , designer and president of the label aemkei moved his company to berlin from new york two years ago .
though benefiting from the city 's cheap rents and its central european location , he thinks there needs to be more investment in retail and more cooperation between the various trade shows before berlin can be mentioned in the same breath as new york , london or tokyo . " what they 're doing now is not helping the buyer , " he said .
" there 's too many trade shows , too many events and the -lrb- buyers -rrb- are confused . " expansion plans bachelin says to be patient . “ it ’ s still coming , " she said .
" we ’ re talking about 3.5 years !
new york had ten years and paris had 100 years to establish itself . " for the time being , all bachelin and her colleagues can continue to do is spread berlin 's good reputation .
bread & butter last year launched a barcelona event that attracted 48,000 people during its first weekend .
in the coming weeks , premium will take seven berlin designers to milan and tokyo to feature in trade shows there .
" times are changing , " says bachelin . maybe berlin 's fashion status will as well . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star designer leaves berlin sometimes she made her students cry , but she also inspired them to be bold and inventive .
the quirkiest and loudest of all iconic designers , vivienne westwood , has left berlin , where she taught for the past 12 years . ´ -lrb- july 4 , 2005 -rrb- berlin becomes fashionista capital this weekend , berlin will drown in a sea of designer clothes , air kisses and runway models .
two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital .
-lrb- july 16 , 2004 -rrb- designer blames recession for fashion faux pas while the rest of germany is busy blaming the economy and the government for all sorts of social woes , the designer jil sander believes the current recession has made a more serious impact - on men 's fashion sense .

steuer - himself a 1997 pairs world champion and 1998 olympic bronze medalist - has been accused of working as an informant for the stasi , the east german secret police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo steuer has not much to smile about these days under the name torsten , he allegedly supplied stasi officials with information about other ice skaters , including katarina witt , from 1985 to 1989 . the issue is one that german sports asssociations have grappled with since reunification as many top athletes and sports functionaries from the former east germany had some involvement with the stasi . olympic registratio n despite ba n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steuer and his partner , mandy wötzel , during their performance at the 1998 olympic winter games in nagano , japan as a result , an independent review board has been set up to evaluate people 's roles .

" what 's happening to me is crazy , " steuer told dpa news service , adding that his charges are suffering as a result . will medal hopefuls skate ? savchenko and szolkowy , who took home silver at the european championships in lyon in mid-january , stand a good chance to receive medals in turin as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.02.2006 keeping up with the pradas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has the talent to be a fashion player , but needs encouragement the week of all-night parties and forests of clothing racks known as berlin fashion week has come to an end .
the capital is a fashionista destination , but will it ever reach the iconic status of a new york or a paris ? so how big can berlin 's fashion scene get ?
as profitable as tokyo 's ?
as glamorous as new york 's ?
as legendary as paris ' ? anita bachelin smiles and then gives a half answer .
" it could be better , but in a different way , " she says .
she thumbs the dial on her blackberry in the vip lounge of the fashion trade show she and partner norbert tillman created in berlin from scratch in 2003 .
in two years , it has become the city 's biggest , joining with major-brand trade show bread & butter and three smaller trade fairs to firmly establish berlin as germany 's fashion capital . soho of europe the hype that has surrounded the city 's young design scene in recent years is the reason tens of thousands of buyers representing clients from los angeles to hong kong , international journalists and hundreds of labels have descended on berlin in the past five days . " berlin is not just fashion , it 's creativity , " says bachelin , fishing a ringing nokia out of her snakeskin purse .
" new yorkers say it ’ s the soho of europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premium has gone from 60 exhibitors in 2003 , to more than 600 this year but as the hype that has surrounded berlin 's burgeoning fashion scene inevitably fades , industry figures like bachelin and tillmann are fighting to ensure the city loses none of the traction it has gained in recent years . cheap rents and low costs of living have nurtured a booming creative scene in post-wall berlin that ranges from art to music , from film to fashion .
berlin designers sell in tokyo department stores , paris showrooms and are featured in magazine spreads .
this year , vogue doyenne anna wintour sent one of her assistants to check out the premium show , says bachelin . some way to go the growth of the city 's two big fairs has been so impressive - premium featured more than 600 exhibitors and bread & butter around 500 - that berlin city officials , who last year began sponsoring an additional trade show , have unified the shows under the title , berlin fashion week .
but if the name is supposed to invoke the glamour of milan , london and new york , the reality is different . " german fashion is not there yet , " said dylan ross , buyer for question air , which supplies stores in london .
" but its potential as a platform is enormous . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor wowereit , here with boris becker 's ex-wife , at a fashion event sunday unlike london - where the government hitched the city 's creative scene to its " cool britannia " campaign - berlin government officials have been slow to recognize the image gain and economic potential in the clothing business .
though it provides small atelier subsidies and other grants , the city has only invested 1.3 million euros in the industry between 1993 and 2005 , according to a economics ministry report .
neither premium nor bread & butter gets any financial support . " they do give us an ear , " says bachelin .
" but we 're -lrb- the ones -rrb- promoting berlin . " a unified effort things are beginning to change .
city officials like the city 's economics senator and mayor klaus wowereit are now trade show regulars , with wowereit giving a speech of thanks -lrb- in english -rrb- at an adidas originals runway show on sunday night .
the berlin trade show association started the " b in berlin " trade show in january 2005 , and joined with premium and new show " fifth floor " to form the " berlin fashion week " event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bread & butter catwalk show from the weekend but state support alone wo n't help . markus klosseck , designer and president of the label aemkei moved his company to berlin from new york two years ago .
though benefiting from the city 's cheap rents and its central european location , he thinks there needs to be more investment in retail and more cooperation between the various trade shows before berlin can be mentioned in the same breath as new york , london or tokyo . " what they 're doing now is not helping the buyer , " he said .
" there 's too many trade shows , too many events and the -lrb- buyers -rrb- are confused . " expansion plans bachelin says to be patient . “ it ’ s still coming , " she said .
" we ’ re talking about 3.5 years !
new york had ten years and paris had 100 years to establish itself . " for the time being , all bachelin and her colleagues can continue to do is spread berlin 's good reputation .
bread & butter last year launched a barcelona event that attracted 48,000 people during its first weekend .
in the coming weeks , premium will take seven berlin designers to milan and tokyo to feature in trade shows there .
" times are changing , " says bachelin . maybe berlin 's fashion status will as well . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de star designer leaves berlin sometimes she made her students cry , but she also inspired them to be bold and inventive .
the quirkiest and loudest of all iconic designers , vivienne westwood , has left berlin , where she taught for the past 12 years . ´ -lrb- july 4 , 2005 -rrb- berlin becomes fashionista capital this weekend , berlin will drown in a sea of designer clothes , air kisses and runway models .
two of europe ’ s hottest fashion events have arrived , cementing the city ’ s reputation as germany ’ s new fashion capital .
-lrb- july 16 , 2004 -rrb- designer blames recession for fashion faux pas while the rest of germany is busy blaming the economy and the government for all sorts of social woes , the designer jil sander believes the current recession has made a more serious impact - on men 's fashion sense .

springer , publisher of the mass-circulation daily bild , had originally signed an agreement with prosiebensat.1 's owner , us-israeli billionaire haim saban , to acquire the broadcaster for 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.0 billion -rrb- in august .
but the merger was blocked both by the media watchdog kek and the federal cartel office on the grounds that it would give springer a dominant market position in advertising and too much influence over public opinion . in face of such fierce resistance , springer announced on wednesday that it was throwing in the towel . " the management board of axel springer and p7s1 holding -lrb- the investor group led by haim saban 's saban capital group -rrb- announced today that they have mutually agreed to terminate plans for axel springer to acquire prosiebensat.1 media , " the newspaper publisher said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saban said he 'd look for alternatives to springer saban issued a statement in munich expressing " disappointment " with the development .
he was nevertheless " extremely satisfied " with the tv group 's performance and would now examine " alternatives " to the springer deal , saban said . the development means the broadcaster could find another buyer .
media reports have suggested that tf1 of france , nbc universal and viacom of the united states could now take a fresh look at the business . the prospect of a fresh takeover battle sent shares in prosiebensat.1 soaring in frankfurt .
the price of shares was showing a gain of 0.70 euros or 3.72 percent at 19.50 euros in mid-morning trade . springer drew the line initially , springer had conceded it was ready to sell one of the group 's four tv channels - the popular prosieben channel - to try and win regulatory approval for the deal .
alongside prosieben , prosiebensat.1 also owns the sat.1 , kabel1 and n24 channels .
but the federal anti-trust office had insisted that prosieben be sold before the takeover , a condition springer was unwilling to fulfill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer decided it was n't worth pursuing the deal springer could have sought special permission from the government to overturn the anti-trust office 's ruling .
but after " extensive analysis and careful consideration of the possibilities for an appeal and other available options , axel springer and p7s1 holding came to the conclusion that in light of the numerous economic and legal uncertainties , a possible appeal or a possible application for a ministerial permit would have resulted in unacceptable risks for all parties involved , " the springer statement continued . " as a consequence , neither the share purchase agreement dated august 5 , 2005 , nor the voluntary public takeover offer made to the shareholders of prosiebensat.1 media will be consummated , " it concluded . prosiebensat.1 chairman guillaume de posch said the takeover by springer " would have been a good solution . "
the broadcaster would now focus on " expanding further under our own strength and concentrate on our operating business , " de posch said .
" our aim is strengthen our core tv business further and to diversify sales .

initially after the iron curtain fell , the german authorities wanted to replace him with the skinnier , less expressive traffic symbol used in the rest of germany .
but residents of the east founded a committee that fought hard to prevent another part of their culture from being swallowed up in the reunification process .
part of east german identity today , there are even areas in western berlin where broken traffic lights have been replaced with ones featuring the inimitable ampelmännchen . " the ossis said that one could not do away with everything that set them apart .
especially since it was something rather fun , " heckhausen told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german traffic light man 's fame is turning to notoriety . the ampelmännchen was created in 1961 by traffic psychologist karl peglau after an increase in cars in east germany made the streets more dangerous for pedestrians . peglau wanted a symbol that would appeal to children and could easily be read by the elderly .
he deliberately made the figure as clear , and cute , as possible .
the ampelmännchen became a much-loved figure in east germany decades before he would become something of a mascot for berlin and one of the tourist attractions of the new german capital . in the 1980s , a cartoon ampelmann explained traffic rules to east german children on television and around the same time an east berlin-based businessman , joachim rossberg , began selling ampelmännchen memorabilia .
battle between east and west ?
rossberg and heckhausen are now facing each other in court , with the former accusing his rival of having infringed his patents for ampelmännchen toys and brandy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rossberg 's company also makes traffic-light women " whether people like it or not , the ampelmännchen remains a symbol of the east .
my company is the one that originally began producing memorabilia , i was doing this long before the iron curtain came down , " rossberg said . heckhausen has countered that rossberg has not exercised his patent rights for the past five years and that they have therefore passed back into the public domain .
his ampelmännchen memorabilia company employs 30 people and made some 2.4 million euros -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- in 2005 . the entrepreneur angrily rejected the picture created in the press of a greedy wessi , using the nickname for western germans , stealing from a poor ossi . " it 's a cliche .
our litigation can hardly be seen as a battle between east and west , " he said . a court in leipzig , in the east of the country , is expected to rule on the matter on feb .

tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken from her so long ago , and we are grateful for the good life of coretta scott king .
each time i am invited to this rostrum , i am humbled by the privilege , and mindful of the history we have seen together .
we have gathered under this capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement .
we have served america through one of the most consequential periods of our history - and it has been my honour to serve with you .
in a system of two parties , two chambers , and two elected branches , there will always be differences and debate .
but even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone , and our differences can not be allowed to harden into anger .
to confront the great issues before us , we must act in a spirit of good will and respect for one another - and i will do my part .
tonight the state of our union is strong - and together we will make it stronger .
in this decisive year , you and i will make choices that determine both the future and the character of our country .
we will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom - or retreat from our duties in the hope of an easier life .
leadership we will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world economy - or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity .
in a complex and challenging time , the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting - yet it ends in danger and decline .
the only way to protect our people - the only way to secure the peace - the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership - so the united states of america will continue to lead .
far from being a hopeless dream , the advance of freedom is the great story of our time abroad , our nation is committed to a historic , long-term goal - we seek the end of tyranny in our world .
some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism .
in reality , the future security of america depends on it .
on september 11 , 2001 , we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state 7,000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country .
dictatorships shelter terrorists , feed resentment and radicalism , and seek weapons of mass destruction .
democracies replace resentment with hope , respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbours , and join the fight against terror .
every step toward freedom in the world makes our country safer , and so we will act boldly in freedom 's cause .
far from being a hopeless dream , the advance of freedom is the great story of our time .
in 1945 , there were about two dozen lonely democracies on earth .
today , there are 122 .
and we are writing a new chapter in the story of self-government - with women lining up to vote in afghanistan - and millions of iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink - and men and women from lebanon to egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom .
at the start of 2006 , more than half the people of our world live in democratic nations .
and we do not forget the other half - in places like syria , burma , zimbabwe , north korea , and iran - because the demands of justice , and the peace of this world , require their freedom as well .
' no surrender ' no one can deny the success of freedom , but some men rage and fight against it .
and one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical islam - the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death .
terrorists like -lsb- osama -rsb- bin laden are serious about mass murder - and all of us must take their declared intentions seriously .
they seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the middle east , and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder .
their aim is to seize power in iraq , and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against america and the world .
lacking the military strength to challenge us directly , the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear .
when they murder children at a school in beslan - or blow up commuters in london - or behead a bound captive - the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will , allowing the violent to inherit the earth .
but they have miscalculated : we love our freedom , and we will fight to keep it .
once again , we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed , and move this world toward peace in a time of testing , we can not find security by abandoning our commitments and retreating within our borders .
if we were to leave these vicious attackers alone , they would not leave us alone .
they would simply move the battlefield to our own shores .
there is no peace in retreat .
and there is no honour in retreat .
by allowing radical islam to work its will - by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself - we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals , or even in our own courage .
but our enemies and our friends can be certain : the united states will not retreat from the world , and we will never surrender to evil .
america rejects the false comfort of isolationism .
we are the nation that saved liberty in europe , and liberated death camps , and helped raise up democracies , and faced down an evil empire .
once again , we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed , and move this world toward peace .
we remain on the offensive against terror networks .
we have killed or captured many of their leaders - and for the others , their day will come .
we remain on the offensive in afghanistan - where a fine president and national assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions of a new democracy .
and we are on the offensive in iraq , with a clear plan for victory .
first , we are helping iraqis build an inclusive government , so that old resentments will be eased , and the insurgency marginalized .
second , we are continuing reconstruction efforts , and helping the iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy , so all iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom .
third , we are striking terrorist targets while we train iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating the enemy .
iraqis are showing their courage every day , and we are proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom .
our work in iraq is difficult , because our enemy is brutal .
but that brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy .
in less than three years , that nation has gone from dictatorship , to liberation , to sovereignty , to a constitution , to national elections .
at the same time , our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration , clearing out insurgent strongholds , and turning over territory to iraqi security forces .
i am confident in our plan for victory - i am confident in the will of the iraqi people - i am confident in the skill and spirit of our military .
fellow citizens , we are in this fight to win , and we are winning .
troop levels the road of victory is the road that will take our troops home .
as we make progress on the ground , and iraqi forces increasingly take the lead , we should be able to further decrease our troop levels - but those decisions will be made by our military commanders , not by politicians in washington dc .
our coalition has learned from experience in iraq .
we have adjusted our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction .
along the way , we have benefited from responsible criticism and counsel offered by members of congress of both parties .
in the coming year , i will continue to reach out and seek your good advice .
we must keep our word , defeat our enemies , and stand behind the american military in its vital mission yet there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success , and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure .
hindsight alone is not wisdom .
and second-guessing is not a strategy .
with so much in the balance , those of us in public office have a duty to speak with candour .
a sudden withdrawal of our forces from iraq would abandon our iraqi allies to death and prison - put men like bin laden and -lsb- abu musab -rsb- al-zarqawi in charge of a strategic country - and show that a pledge from america means little .
members of congress : however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past , our nation has only one option : we must keep our word , defeat our enemies , and stand behind the american military in its vital mission .
our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices - and showing a sense of duty stronger than all fear .
they know what it is like to fight house to house in a maze of streets - to wear heavy gear in the desert heat - to see a comrade killed by a roadside bomb .
and those who know the costs also know the stakes .
' never falter ' marine staff sergeant dan clay was killed last month fighting the enemy in falluja .
he left behind a letter to his family , but his words could just as well be addressed to every american .
here is what dan wrote : " i know what honour is .
it has been an honour to protect and serve all of you .
i faced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to .
never falter !
do n't hesitate to honour and support those of us who have the honour of protecting that which is worth protecting . "
staff sergeant dan clay 's wife , lisa , and his mom and dad , sara jo and bud , are with us this evening .
our nation is grateful to the fallen , who live in the memory of our country .
we are grateful to all who volunteer to wear our nation 's uniform - and as we honour our brave troops , let us never forget the sacrifices of america 's military families .
the iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions our offensive against terror involves more than military action .
ultimately , the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change .
so the united states of america supports democratic reform across the broader middle east .
elections are vital - but they are only the beginning .
raising up a democracy requires the rule of law , protection of minorities , and strong , accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote .
the great people of egypt have voted in a multi-party presidential election - and now their government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism .
the palestinian people have voted in elections - now the leaders of hamas must recognize israel , disarm , reject terrorism , and work for lasting peace .
saudi arabia has taken the first steps of reform - now it can offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts .
democracies in the middle east will not look like our own , because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens .
yet liberty is the future of every nation in the middle east , because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity .
the same is true of iran , a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people .
the regime in that country sponsors terrorists in the palestinian territories and in lebanon - and that must come to an end .
the iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions - and the nations of the world must not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons .
america will continue to rally the world to confront these threats .
and tonight , let me speak directly to the citizens of iran : america respects you , and we respect your country .
we respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom .
and our nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic iran .
compassion to overcome dangers in our world , we must also take the offensive by encouraging economic progress , fighting disease , and spreading hope in hopeless lands .
isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies , it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need .
we show compassion abroad because americans believe in the god-given dignity and worth of a villager with hiv / aids , or an infant with malaria , or a refugee fleeing genocide , or a young girl sold into slavery .
we also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty , corruption , and despair are sources of terrorism , organized crime , human trafficking , and the drug trade .
in recent years , you and i have taken unprecedented action to fight aids and malaria , expand the education of girls , and reward developing nations that are moving forward with economic and political reform .
for people everywhere , the united states is a partner for a better life .
short-changing these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of our world , undercut our long-term security , and dull the conscience of our country .
i urge members of congress to serve the interests of america by showing the compassion of america .
vigilance at home our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home .
the enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us .
fortunately , this nation has superb professionals in law enforcement , intelligence , the military , and homeland security .
these men and women are dedicating their lives to protecting us all , and they deserve our support and our thanks .
they also deserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking and organized crime - so i ask you to reauthorize the patriot act .
it is said that prior to the attacks of september 11 , our government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy .
if there are people inside our country who are talking with al-qaeda , we want to know about it we now know that two of the hijackers in the united states placed telephone calls to al-qaeda operatives overseas .
but we did not know about their plans until it was too late .
so to prevent another attack - based on authority given to me by the constitution and by statute - i have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected al-qaeda operatives and affiliates to and from america .
previous presidents have used the same constitutional authority i have - and federal courts have approved the use of that authority .
appropriate members of congress have been kept informed .
this terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks .
it remains essential to the security of america .
if there are people inside our country who are talking with al-qaeda , we want to know about it - because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again .
in all these areas - from the disruption of terror networks , to victory in iraq , to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions - we need the support of friends and allies .
to draw that support , we must always be clear in our principles and willing to act .
the only alternative to american leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world .
yet we also choose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth .
american leaders - from roosevelt to truman to kennedy to reagan - rejected isolation and retreat , because they knew that america is always more secure when freedom is on the march .
our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy - a war that will be fought by presidents of both parties , who will need steady bipartisan support from the congress .
and tonight i ask for yours .
together , let us protect our country , support the men and women who defend us , and lead this world toward freedom .
strong economy here at home , america also has a great opportunity : we will build the prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world .
our economy is healthy , and vigorous , and growing faster than other major industrialized nations .
in the last two-and-a-half years , america has created 4.6 million new jobs - more than japan and the european union combined .
even in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters , the american people have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world .
the american economy is pre-eminent - but we can not afford to be complacent .
in a dynamic world economy , we are seeing new competitors like china and india .
this creates uncertainty , which makes it easier to feed peoples fears .
and so we are seeing some old temptations return .
and our economy grows when americans have more of their own money to spend , save , and invest protectionists want to escape competition , pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy .
others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy , centralizing more power in washington and increasing taxes .
we hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy - even though this economy could not function without them .
all these are forms of economic retreat , and they lead in the same direction - toward a stagnant and second-rate economy .
tonight i will set out a better path - an agenda for a nation that competes with confidence - an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs .
americans should not fear our economic future , because we intend to shape it .
keeping america competitive begins with keeping our economy growing .
and our economy grows when americans have more of their own money to spend , save , and invest .
in the last five years , the tax relief you passed has left $ 880bn in the hands of american workers , investors , small businesses , and families - and they have used it to help produce more than four years of uninterrupted economic growth .
yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few years .
if we do nothing , american families will face a massive tax increase they do not expect and will not welcome .
because america needs more than a temporary expansion , we need more than temporary tax relief .
i urge the congress to act responsibly , and make the tax cuts permanent .
keeping america competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars .
every year of my presidency , we have reduced the growth of non-security discretionary spending - and last year you passed bills that cut this spending .
this year my budget will cut it again , and reduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities .
by passing these reforms , we will save the american taxpayer another $ 14bn next year - and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009 .
i am pleased that members of congress are working on earmark reform - because the federal budget has too many special interest projects .
and we can tackle this problem together , if you pass the line-item veto .
baby boomers we must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending , or entitlements .
this year , the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60 , including two of my dad 's favourite people - me , and president bill clinton .
this milestone is more than a personal crisis - it is a national challenge .
the retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the federal government .
by 2030 , spending for social security , medicare , and medicaid alone will be almost 60 % of the entire federal budget .
and that will present future congresses with impossible choices - staggering tax increases , immense deficits , or deep cuts in every category of spending .
congress did not act last year on my proposal to save social security , yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away - and with every year we fail to act , the situation gets worse .
with open markets and a level playing field , no one can out-produce or out-compete the american worker so tonight , i ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on social security , medicare , and medicaid .
this commission should include members of congress of both parties , and offer bipartisan answers .
we need to put aside partisan politics , work together , and get this problem solved .
keeping america competitive requires us to open more markets for all that americans make and grow .
one out of every five factory jobs in america is related to global trade , and we want people everywhere to buy american .
with open markets and a level playing field , no one can out-produce or out-compete the american worker .
keeping america competitive requires an immigration system that upholds our laws , reflects our values , and serves the interests of our economy .
our nation needs orderly and secure borders .
to meet this goal , we must have stronger immigration enforcement and border protection .
and we must have a rational , humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty - allows temporary jobs for people who seek them legally - and reduces smuggling and crime at the border .
keeping america competitive requires affordable health care .
our government has a responsibility to help provide health care for the poor and the elderly , and we are meeting that responsibility .
for all americans , we must confront the rising cost of care - strengthen the doctor-patient relationship - and help people afford the insurance coverage they need .
we will make wider use of electronic records and other health information technology , to help control costs and reduce dangerous medical errors .
we will strengthen health savings accounts - by making sure individuals and small business employees can buy insurance with the same advantages that people working for big businesses now get .
we will do more to make this coverage portable , so workers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their health insurance .
and because lawsuits are driving many good doctors out of practice - leaving women in nearly 1,500 american counties without a single ob-gyn - i ask the congress to pass medical liability reform this year .
oil addiction keeping america competitive requires affordable energy .
here we have a serious problem : america is addicted to oil , which is often imported from unstable parts of the world .
the best way to break this addiction is through technology .
since 2001 , we have spent nearly $ 10bn to develop cleaner , cheaper , more reliable alternative energy sources - and we are on the threshold of incredible advances .
so tonight , i announce the advanced energy initiative - a 22 % increase in clean-energy research at the department of energy , to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas .
this country can move beyond a petroleum-based economy and make our dependence on middle eastern oil a thing of the past to change how we power our homes and offices , we will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired plants ; revolutionary solar and wind technologies ; and clean , safe nuclear energy .
we must also change how we power our automobiles .
we will increase our research in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars , and in pollution-free cars that run on hydrogen .
we will also fund additional research in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol , not just from corn but from wood chips , stalks , or switch grass .
our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six years .
breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal : to replace more than 75 % of our oil imports from the middle east by 2025 .
by applying the talent and technology of america , this country can dramatically improve our environment - move beyond a petroleum-based economy - and make our dependence on middle eastern oil a thing of the past .
human resources and to keep america competitive , one commitment is necessary above all : we must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity .
our greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated , hard-working , ambitious people - and we are going to keep that edge .
tonight i announce the american competitiveness initiative , to encourage innovation throughout our economy , and to give our nations children a firm grounding in math and science .
first : i propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years .
this funding will support the work of americas most creative minds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology , supercomputing , and alternative energy sources .
second : i propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit , to encourage bolder private-sector investment in technology .
with more research in both the public and private sectors , we will improve our quality of life - and ensure that america will lead the world in opportunity and innovation for decades to come .
third : we need to encourage children to take more math and science , and make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations .
we have made a good start in the early grades with the no child left behind act , which is raising standards and lifting test scores across our country .
in recent years , america has become a more hopeful nation tonight i propose to train 70,000 high school teachers , to lead advanced-placement courses in math and science - bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms - and give early help to students who struggle with math , so they have a better chance at good , high-wage jobs .
if we ensure that america 's children succeed in life , they will ensure that america succeeds in the world .
preparing our nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can share .
i urge you to support the american competitiveness initiative - and together we will show the world what the american people can achieve .
hopeful society america is a great force for freedom and prosperity .
yet our greatness is not measured in power or luxuries , but by who we are and how we treat one another .
so we strive to be a compassionate , decent , hopeful society .
in recent years , america has become a more hopeful nation .
violent crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s .
welfare cases have dropped by more than half over the past decade .
drug use among youth is down 19 % since 2001 .
there are fewer abortions in america than at any point in the last three decades , and the number of children born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a row .
these gains are evidence of a quiet transformation - a revolution of conscience , in which a rising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibility is a life of fulfilment .
government has played a role .
wise policies such as welfare reform , drug education , and support for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our country .
and everyone here tonight , democrat and republican , has a right to be proud of this record .
yet many americans , especially parents , still have deep concerns about the direction of our culture , and the health of our most basic institutions .
they are concerned about unethical conduct by public officials , and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage .
and they worry about children in our society who need direction and love - and about fellow citizens still displaced by natural disaster - and about suffering caused by treatable disease .
as we look at these challenges , we must never give in to the belief that america is in decline , or that our culture is doomed to unravel .
the american people know better than that .
we have proven the pessimists wrong before - and we will do it again .
a hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under law .
the supreme court now has two superb new members , chief justice john roberts and justice sam alito .
i thank the senate for confirming both of them .
and i will continue to nominate men and women who understand that judges must be servants of the law , and not legislate from the bench .
today marks the official retirement of a very special american .
for 24 years of faithful service to our nation , the united states is grateful to justice sandra day o 'connor .
cloning ban a hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners , and that recognize the matchless value of every life .
tonight i ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research - human cloning in all its forms - creating or implanting embryos for experiments - creating human-animal hybrids - and buying , selling , or patenting human embryos .
human life is a gift from our creator - and that gift should never be discarded , devalued , or put up for sale .
a hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust .
honourable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the ethical standards of washington - and i support your efforts .
each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility - and that is a pledge we must never forget , never dismiss , and never betray .
as we renew the promise of our institutions , let us also show the character of america in our compassion and care for one another .
a hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and love .
through the helping america 's youth initiative , we are encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a child - and this good work is led by our first lady , laura bush .
this year we will add resources to encourage young people to stay in school - so more of america 's youth can raise their sights and achieve their dreams .
more than a million americans live with hiv , and half of all aids cases occur among african-americans a hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency - and stays at it until they are back on their feet .
so far the federal government has committed $ 85bn to the people of the gulf coast and new orleans .
we are removing debris , repairing highways , and building stronger levees .
we are providing business loans and housing assistance .
yet as we meet these immediate needs , we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived .
in new orleans and in other places , many of our fellow citizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country .
the answer is not only temporary relief , but schools that teach every child - and job skills that bring upward mobility - and more opportunities to own a home and start a business .
as we recover from a disaster , let us also work for the day when all americans are protected by justice , equal in hope , and rich in opportunity .
a hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like hiv / aids , which can be prevented , and treated , and defeated .
more than a million americans live with hiv , and half of all aids cases occur among african-americans .
i ask congress to reform and reauthorize the ryan white act - and provide new funding to states , so we end the waiting lists for aids medicine in america .
we will also lead a nationwide effort , working closely with african-american churches and faith-based groups , to deliver rapid hiv tests to millions , end the stigma of aids , and come closer to the day when there are no new infections in america .
fellow citizens , we have been called to leadership in a period of consequence .
we have entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite .
we see great changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives .
and sometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc , toward an unknown shore .
yet the destination of history is determined by human action , and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing .
lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery .
martin luther king could have stopped at birmingham or at selma , and achieved only half a victory over segregation .
the united states could have accepted the permanent division of europe , and been complicit in the oppression of others .
today , having come far in our own historical journey , we must decide : will we turn back , or finish well ?
before history is written down in books , it is written in courage .
like americans before us , we will show that courage and we will finish well .
we will lead freedoms advance .
we will compete and excel in the global economy .
we will renew the defining moral commitments of this land .
and so we move forward - optimistic about our country , faithful to its cause , and confident of victories to come .
thank you , god bless you , and may god bless america .

tonight we are comforted by the hope of a glad reunion with the husband who was taken from her so long ago , and we are grateful for the good life of coretta scott king .
each time i am invited to this rostrum , i am humbled by the privilege , and mindful of the history we have seen together .
we have gathered under this capitol dome in moments of national mourning and national achievement .
we have served america through one of the most consequential periods of our history - and it has been my honour to serve with you .
in a system of two parties , two chambers , and two elected branches , there will always be differences and debate .
but even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone , and our differences can not be allowed to harden into anger .
to confront the great issues before us , we must act in a spirit of good will and respect for one another - and i will do my part .
tonight the state of our union is strong - and together we will make it stronger .
in this decisive year , you and i will make choices that determine both the future and the character of our country .
we will choose to act confidently in pursuing the enemies of freedom - or retreat from our duties in the hope of an easier life .
leadership we will choose to build our prosperity by leading the world economy - or shut ourselves off from trade and opportunity .
in a complex and challenging time , the road of isolationism and protectionism may seem broad and inviting - yet it ends in danger and decline .
the only way to protect our people - the only way to secure the peace - the only way to control our destiny is by our leadership - so the united states of america will continue to lead .
far from being a hopeless dream , the advance of freedom is the great story of our time abroad , our nation is committed to a historic , long-term goal - we seek the end of tyranny in our world .
some dismiss that goal as misguided idealism .
in reality , the future security of america depends on it .
on september 11 , 2001 , we found that problems originating in a failed and oppressive state 7,000 miles away could bring murder and destruction to our country .
dictatorships shelter terrorists , feed resentment and radicalism , and seek weapons of mass destruction .
democracies replace resentment with hope , respect the rights of their citizens and their neighbours , and join the fight against terror .
every step toward freedom in the world makes our country safer , and so we will act boldly in freedom 's cause .
far from being a hopeless dream , the advance of freedom is the great story of our time .
in 1945 , there were about two dozen lonely democracies on earth .
today , there are 122 .
and we are writing a new chapter in the story of self-government - with women lining up to vote in afghanistan - and millions of iraqis marking their liberty with purple ink - and men and women from lebanon to egypt debating the rights of individuals and the necessity of freedom .
at the start of 2006 , more than half the people of our world live in democratic nations .
and we do not forget the other half - in places like syria , burma , zimbabwe , north korea , and iran - because the demands of justice , and the peace of this world , require their freedom as well .
' no surrender ' no one can deny the success of freedom , but some men rage and fight against it .
and one of the main sources of reaction and opposition is radical islam - the perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death .
terrorists like -lsb- osama -rsb- bin laden are serious about mass murder - and all of us must take their declared intentions seriously .
they seek to impose a heartless system of totalitarian control throughout the middle east , and arm themselves with weapons of mass murder .
their aim is to seize power in iraq , and use it as a safe haven to launch attacks against america and the world .
lacking the military strength to challenge us directly , the terrorists have chosen the weapon of fear .
when they murder children at a school in beslan - or blow up commuters in london - or behead a bound captive - the terrorists hope these horrors will break our will , allowing the violent to inherit the earth .
but they have miscalculated : we love our freedom , and we will fight to keep it .
once again , we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed , and move this world toward peace in a time of testing , we can not find security by abandoning our commitments and retreating within our borders .
if we were to leave these vicious attackers alone , they would not leave us alone .
they would simply move the battlefield to our own shores .
there is no peace in retreat .
and there is no honour in retreat .
by allowing radical islam to work its will - by leaving an assaulted world to fend for itself - we would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals , or even in our own courage .
but our enemies and our friends can be certain : the united states will not retreat from the world , and we will never surrender to evil .
america rejects the false comfort of isolationism .
we are the nation that saved liberty in europe , and liberated death camps , and helped raise up democracies , and faced down an evil empire .
once again , we accept the call of history to deliver the oppressed , and move this world toward peace .
we remain on the offensive against terror networks .
we have killed or captured many of their leaders - and for the others , their day will come .
we remain on the offensive in afghanistan - where a fine president and national assembly are fighting terror while building the institutions of a new democracy .
and we are on the offensive in iraq , with a clear plan for victory .
first , we are helping iraqis build an inclusive government , so that old resentments will be eased , and the insurgency marginalized .
second , we are continuing reconstruction efforts , and helping the iraqi government to fight corruption and build a modern economy , so all iraqis can experience the benefits of freedom .
third , we are striking terrorist targets while we train iraqi forces that are increasingly capable of defeating the enemy .
iraqis are showing their courage every day , and we are proud to be their allies in the cause of freedom .
our work in iraq is difficult , because our enemy is brutal .
but that brutality has not stopped the dramatic progress of a new democracy .
in less than three years , that nation has gone from dictatorship , to liberation , to sovereignty , to a constitution , to national elections .
at the same time , our coalition has been relentless in shutting off terrorist infiltration , clearing out insurgent strongholds , and turning over territory to iraqi security forces .
i am confident in our plan for victory - i am confident in the will of the iraqi people - i am confident in the skill and spirit of our military .
fellow citizens , we are in this fight to win , and we are winning .
troop levels the road of victory is the road that will take our troops home .
as we make progress on the ground , and iraqi forces increasingly take the lead , we should be able to further decrease our troop levels - but those decisions will be made by our military commanders , not by politicians in washington dc .
our coalition has learned from experience in iraq .
we have adjusted our military tactics and changed our approach to reconstruction .
along the way , we have benefited from responsible criticism and counsel offered by members of congress of both parties .
in the coming year , i will continue to reach out and seek your good advice .
we must keep our word , defeat our enemies , and stand behind the american military in its vital mission yet there is a difference between responsible criticism that aims for success , and defeatism that refuses to acknowledge anything but failure .
hindsight alone is not wisdom .
and second-guessing is not a strategy .
with so much in the balance , those of us in public office have a duty to speak with candour .
a sudden withdrawal of our forces from iraq would abandon our iraqi allies to death and prison - put men like bin laden and -lsb- abu musab -rsb- al-zarqawi in charge of a strategic country - and show that a pledge from america means little .
members of congress : however we feel about the decisions and debates of the past , our nation has only one option : we must keep our word , defeat our enemies , and stand behind the american military in its vital mission .
our men and women in uniform are making sacrifices - and showing a sense of duty stronger than all fear .
they know what it is like to fight house to house in a maze of streets - to wear heavy gear in the desert heat - to see a comrade killed by a roadside bomb .
and those who know the costs also know the stakes .
' never falter ' marine staff sergeant dan clay was killed last month fighting the enemy in falluja .
he left behind a letter to his family , but his words could just as well be addressed to every american .
here is what dan wrote : " i know what honour is .
it has been an honour to protect and serve all of you .
i faced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to .
never falter !
do n't hesitate to honour and support those of us who have the honour of protecting that which is worth protecting . "
staff sergeant dan clay 's wife , lisa , and his mom and dad , sara jo and bud , are with us this evening .
our nation is grateful to the fallen , who live in the memory of our country .
we are grateful to all who volunteer to wear our nation 's uniform - and as we honour our brave troops , let us never forget the sacrifices of america 's military families .
the iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions our offensive against terror involves more than military action .
ultimately , the only way to defeat the terrorists is to defeat their dark vision of hatred and fear by offering the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change .
so the united states of america supports democratic reform across the broader middle east .
elections are vital - but they are only the beginning .
raising up a democracy requires the rule of law , protection of minorities , and strong , accountable institutions that last longer than a single vote .
the great people of egypt have voted in a multi-party presidential election - and now their government should open paths of peaceful opposition that will reduce the appeal of radicalism .
the palestinian people have voted in elections - now the leaders of hamas must recognize israel , disarm , reject terrorism , and work for lasting peace .
saudi arabia has taken the first steps of reform - now it can offer its people a better future by pressing forward with those efforts .
democracies in the middle east will not look like our own , because they will reflect the traditions of their own citizens .
yet liberty is the future of every nation in the middle east , because liberty is the right and hope of all humanity .
the same is true of iran , a nation now held hostage by a small clerical elite that is isolating and repressing its people .
the regime in that country sponsors terrorists in the palestinian territories and in lebanon - and that must come to an end .
the iranian government is defying the world with its nuclear ambitions - and the nations of the world must not permit the iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons .
america will continue to rally the world to confront these threats .
and tonight , let me speak directly to the citizens of iran : america respects you , and we respect your country .
we respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom .
and our nation hopes one day to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic iran .
compassion to overcome dangers in our world , we must also take the offensive by encouraging economic progress , fighting disease , and spreading hope in hopeless lands .
isolationism would not only tie our hands in fighting enemies , it would keep us from helping our friends in desperate need .
we show compassion abroad because americans believe in the god-given dignity and worth of a villager with hiv / aids , or an infant with malaria , or a refugee fleeing genocide , or a young girl sold into slavery .
we also show compassion abroad because regions overwhelmed by poverty , corruption , and despair are sources of terrorism , organized crime , human trafficking , and the drug trade .
in recent years , you and i have taken unprecedented action to fight aids and malaria , expand the education of girls , and reward developing nations that are moving forward with economic and political reform .
for people everywhere , the united states is a partner for a better life .
short-changing these efforts would increase the suffering and chaos of our world , undercut our long-term security , and dull the conscience of our country .
i urge members of congress to serve the interests of america by showing the compassion of america .
vigilance at home our country must also remain on the offensive against terrorism here at home .
the enemy has not lost the desire or capability to attack us .
fortunately , this nation has superb professionals in law enforcement , intelligence , the military , and homeland security .
these men and women are dedicating their lives to protecting us all , and they deserve our support and our thanks .
they also deserve the same tools they already use to fight drug trafficking and organized crime - so i ask you to reauthorize the patriot act .
it is said that prior to the attacks of september 11 , our government failed to connect the dots of the conspiracy .
if there are people inside our country who are talking with al-qaeda , we want to know about it we now know that two of the hijackers in the united states placed telephone calls to al-qaeda operatives overseas .
but we did not know about their plans until it was too late .
so to prevent another attack - based on authority given to me by the constitution and by statute - i have authorized a terrorist surveillance program to aggressively pursue the international communications of suspected al-qaeda operatives and affiliates to and from america .
previous presidents have used the same constitutional authority i have - and federal courts have approved the use of that authority .
appropriate members of congress have been kept informed .
this terrorist surveillance program has helped prevent terrorist attacks .
it remains essential to the security of america .
if there are people inside our country who are talking with al-qaeda , we want to know about it - because we will not sit back and wait to be hit again .
in all these areas - from the disruption of terror networks , to victory in iraq , to the spread of freedom and hope in troubled regions - we need the support of friends and allies .
to draw that support , we must always be clear in our principles and willing to act .
the only alternative to american leadership is a dramatically more dangerous and anxious world .
yet we also choose to lead because it is a privilege to serve the values that gave us birth .
american leaders - from roosevelt to truman to kennedy to reagan - rejected isolation and retreat , because they knew that america is always more secure when freedom is on the march .
our own generation is in a long war against a determined enemy - a war that will be fought by presidents of both parties , who will need steady bipartisan support from the congress .
and tonight i ask for yours .
together , let us protect our country , support the men and women who defend us , and lead this world toward freedom .
strong economy here at home , america also has a great opportunity : we will build the prosperity of our country by strengthening our economic leadership in the world .
our economy is healthy , and vigorous , and growing faster than other major industrialized nations .
in the last two-and-a-half years , america has created 4.6 million new jobs - more than japan and the european union combined .
even in the face of higher energy prices and natural disasters , the american people have turned in an economic performance that is the envy of the world .
the american economy is pre-eminent - but we can not afford to be complacent .
in a dynamic world economy , we are seeing new competitors like china and india .
this creates uncertainty , which makes it easier to feed peoples fears .
and so we are seeing some old temptations return .
and our economy grows when americans have more of their own money to spend , save , and invest protectionists want to escape competition , pretending that we can keep our high standard of living while walling off our economy .
others say that the government needs to take a larger role in directing the economy , centralizing more power in washington and increasing taxes .
we hear claims that immigrants are somehow bad for the economy - even though this economy could not function without them .
all these are forms of economic retreat , and they lead in the same direction - toward a stagnant and second-rate economy .
tonight i will set out a better path - an agenda for a nation that competes with confidence - an agenda that will raise standards of living and generate new jobs .
americans should not fear our economic future , because we intend to shape it .
keeping america competitive begins with keeping our economy growing .
and our economy grows when americans have more of their own money to spend , save , and invest .
in the last five years , the tax relief you passed has left $ 880bn in the hands of american workers , investors , small businesses , and families - and they have used it to help produce more than four years of uninterrupted economic growth .
yet the tax relief is set to expire in the next few years .
if we do nothing , american families will face a massive tax increase they do not expect and will not welcome .
because america needs more than a temporary expansion , we need more than temporary tax relief .
i urge the congress to act responsibly , and make the tax cuts permanent .
keeping america competitive requires us to be good stewards of tax dollars .
every year of my presidency , we have reduced the growth of non-security discretionary spending - and last year you passed bills that cut this spending .
this year my budget will cut it again , and reduce or eliminate more than 140 programs that are performing poorly or not fulfilling essential priorities .
by passing these reforms , we will save the american taxpayer another $ 14bn next year - and stay on track to cut the deficit in half by 2009 .
i am pleased that members of congress are working on earmark reform - because the federal budget has too many special interest projects .
and we can tackle this problem together , if you pass the line-item veto .
baby boomers we must also confront the larger challenge of mandatory spending , or entitlements .
this year , the first of about 78 million baby boomers turn 60 , including two of my dad 's favourite people - me , and president bill clinton .
this milestone is more than a personal crisis - it is a national challenge .
the retirement of the baby boom generation will put unprecedented strains on the federal government .
by 2030 , spending for social security , medicare , and medicaid alone will be almost 60 % of the entire federal budget .
and that will present future congresses with impossible choices - staggering tax increases , immense deficits , or deep cuts in every category of spending .
congress did not act last year on my proposal to save social security , yet the rising cost of entitlements is a problem that is not going away - and with every year we fail to act , the situation gets worse .
with open markets and a level playing field , no one can out-produce or out-compete the american worker so tonight , i ask you to join me in creating a commission to examine the full impact of baby boom retirements on social security , medicare , and medicaid .
this commission should include members of congress of both parties , and offer bipartisan answers .
we need to put aside partisan politics , work together , and get this problem solved .
keeping america competitive requires us to open more markets for all that americans make and grow .
one out of every five factory jobs in america is related to global trade , and we want people everywhere to buy american .
with open markets and a level playing field , no one can out-produce or out-compete the american worker .
keeping america competitive requires an immigration system that upholds our laws , reflects our values , and serves the interests of our economy .
our nation needs orderly and secure borders .
to meet this goal , we must have stronger immigration enforcement and border protection .
and we must have a rational , humane guest worker program that rejects amnesty - allows temporary jobs for people who seek them legally - and reduces smuggling and crime at the border .
keeping america competitive requires affordable health care .
our government has a responsibility to help provide health care for the poor and the elderly , and we are meeting that responsibility .
for all americans , we must confront the rising cost of care - strengthen the doctor-patient relationship - and help people afford the insurance coverage they need .
we will make wider use of electronic records and other health information technology , to help control costs and reduce dangerous medical errors .
we will strengthen health savings accounts - by making sure individuals and small business employees can buy insurance with the same advantages that people working for big businesses now get .
we will do more to make this coverage portable , so workers can switch jobs without having to worry about losing their health insurance .
and because lawsuits are driving many good doctors out of practice - leaving women in nearly 1,500 american counties without a single ob-gyn - i ask the congress to pass medical liability reform this year .
oil addiction keeping america competitive requires affordable energy .
here we have a serious problem : america is addicted to oil , which is often imported from unstable parts of the world .
the best way to break this addiction is through technology .
since 2001 , we have spent nearly $ 10bn to develop cleaner , cheaper , more reliable alternative energy sources - and we are on the threshold of incredible advances .
so tonight , i announce the advanced energy initiative - a 22 % increase in clean-energy research at the department of energy , to push for breakthroughs in two vital areas .
this country can move beyond a petroleum-based economy and make our dependence on middle eastern oil a thing of the past to change how we power our homes and offices , we will invest more in zero-emission coal-fired plants ; revolutionary solar and wind technologies ; and clean , safe nuclear energy .
we must also change how we power our automobiles .
we will increase our research in better batteries for hybrid and electric cars , and in pollution-free cars that run on hydrogen .
we will also fund additional research in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol , not just from corn but from wood chips , stalks , or switch grass .
our goal is to make this new kind of ethanol practical and competitive within six years .
breakthroughs on this and other new technologies will help us reach another great goal : to replace more than 75 % of our oil imports from the middle east by 2025 .
by applying the talent and technology of america , this country can dramatically improve our environment - move beyond a petroleum-based economy - and make our dependence on middle eastern oil a thing of the past .
human resources and to keep america competitive , one commitment is necessary above all : we must continue to lead the world in human talent and creativity .
our greatest advantage in the world has always been our educated , hard-working , ambitious people - and we are going to keep that edge .
tonight i announce the american competitiveness initiative , to encourage innovation throughout our economy , and to give our nations children a firm grounding in math and science .
first : i propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years .
this funding will support the work of americas most creative minds as they explore promising areas such as nanotechnology , supercomputing , and alternative energy sources .
second : i propose to make permanent the research and development tax credit , to encourage bolder private-sector investment in technology .
with more research in both the public and private sectors , we will improve our quality of life - and ensure that america will lead the world in opportunity and innovation for decades to come .
third : we need to encourage children to take more math and science , and make sure those courses are rigorous enough to compete with other nations .
we have made a good start in the early grades with the no child left behind act , which is raising standards and lifting test scores across our country .
in recent years , america has become a more hopeful nation tonight i propose to train 70,000 high school teachers , to lead advanced-placement courses in math and science - bring 30,000 math and science professionals to teach in classrooms - and give early help to students who struggle with math , so they have a better chance at good , high-wage jobs .
if we ensure that america 's children succeed in life , they will ensure that america succeeds in the world .
preparing our nation to compete in the world is a goal that all of us can share .
i urge you to support the american competitiveness initiative - and together we will show the world what the american people can achieve .
hopeful society america is a great force for freedom and prosperity .
yet our greatness is not measured in power or luxuries , but by who we are and how we treat one another .
so we strive to be a compassionate , decent , hopeful society .
in recent years , america has become a more hopeful nation .
violent crime rates have fallen to their lowest levels since the 1970s .
welfare cases have dropped by more than half over the past decade .
drug use among youth is down 19 % since 2001 .
there are fewer abortions in america than at any point in the last three decades , and the number of children born to teenage mothers has been falling for a dozen years in a row .
these gains are evidence of a quiet transformation - a revolution of conscience , in which a rising generation is finding that a life of personal responsibility is a life of fulfilment .
government has played a role .
wise policies such as welfare reform , drug education , and support for abstinence and adoption have made a difference in the character of our country .
and everyone here tonight , democrat and republican , has a right to be proud of this record .
yet many americans , especially parents , still have deep concerns about the direction of our culture , and the health of our most basic institutions .
they are concerned about unethical conduct by public officials , and discouraged by activist courts that try to redefine marriage .
and they worry about children in our society who need direction and love - and about fellow citizens still displaced by natural disaster - and about suffering caused by treatable disease .
as we look at these challenges , we must never give in to the belief that america is in decline , or that our culture is doomed to unravel .
the american people know better than that .
we have proven the pessimists wrong before - and we will do it again .
a hopeful society depends on courts that deliver equal justice under law .
the supreme court now has two superb new members , chief justice john roberts and justice sam alito .
i thank the senate for confirming both of them .
and i will continue to nominate men and women who understand that judges must be servants of the law , and not legislate from the bench .
today marks the official retirement of a very special american .
for 24 years of faithful service to our nation , the united states is grateful to justice sandra day o 'connor .
cloning ban a hopeful society has institutions of science and medicine that do not cut ethical corners , and that recognize the matchless value of every life .
tonight i ask you to pass legislation to prohibit the most egregious abuses of medical research - human cloning in all its forms - creating or implanting embryos for experiments - creating human-animal hybrids - and buying , selling , or patenting human embryos .
human life is a gift from our creator - and that gift should never be discarded , devalued , or put up for sale .
a hopeful society expects elected officials to uphold the public trust .
honourable people in both parties are working on reforms to strengthen the ethical standards of washington - and i support your efforts .
each of us has made a pledge to be worthy of public responsibility - and that is a pledge we must never forget , never dismiss , and never betray .
as we renew the promise of our institutions , let us also show the character of america in our compassion and care for one another .
a hopeful society gives special attention to children who lack direction and love .
through the helping america 's youth initiative , we are encouraging caring adults to get involved in the life of a child - and this good work is led by our first lady , laura bush .
this year we will add resources to encourage young people to stay in school - so more of america 's youth can raise their sights and achieve their dreams .
more than a million americans live with hiv , and half of all aids cases occur among african-americans a hopeful society comes to the aid of fellow citizens in times of suffering and emergency - and stays at it until they are back on their feet .
so far the federal government has committed $ 85bn to the people of the gulf coast and new orleans .
we are removing debris , repairing highways , and building stronger levees .
we are providing business loans and housing assistance .
yet as we meet these immediate needs , we must also address deeper challenges that existed before the storm arrived .
in new orleans and in other places , many of our fellow citizens have felt excluded from the promise of our country .
the answer is not only temporary relief , but schools that teach every child - and job skills that bring upward mobility - and more opportunities to own a home and start a business .
as we recover from a disaster , let us also work for the day when all americans are protected by justice , equal in hope , and rich in opportunity .
a hopeful society acts boldly to fight diseases like hiv / aids , which can be prevented , and treated , and defeated .
more than a million americans live with hiv , and half of all aids cases occur among african-americans .
i ask congress to reform and reauthorize the ryan white act - and provide new funding to states , so we end the waiting lists for aids medicine in america .
we will also lead a nationwide effort , working closely with african-american churches and faith-based groups , to deliver rapid hiv tests to millions , end the stigma of aids , and come closer to the day when there are no new infections in america .
fellow citizens , we have been called to leadership in a period of consequence .
we have entered a great ideological conflict we did nothing to invite .
we see great changes in science and commerce that will influence all our lives .
and sometimes it can seem that history is turning in a wide arc , toward an unknown shore .
yet the destination of history is determined by human action , and every great movement of history comes to a point of choosing .
lincoln could have accepted peace at the cost of disunity and continued slavery .
martin luther king could have stopped at birmingham or at selma , and achieved only half a victory over segregation .
the united states could have accepted the permanent division of europe , and been complicit in the oppression of others .
today , having come far in our own historical journey , we must decide : will we turn back , or finish well ?
before history is written down in books , it is written in courage .
like americans before us , we will show that courage and we will finish well .
we will lead freedoms advance .
we will compete and excel in the global economy .
we will renew the defining moral commitments of this land .
and so we move forward - optimistic about our country , faithful to its cause , and confident of victories to come .
thank you , god bless you , and may god bless america .

reese co-stars with joaquin phoenix as the country singer june carter cash - and , amazingly , she sings all her own songs : " that was the most challenging part of the role , " she told breakfast 's dermot murnaghan and sian williams .
" i had to learn to sing : i 'd never sung professionally . "
reese and her co-star joaquin spent six months learning to sing country .
and they recorded their concert scenes in front of a real audience .
" i had the most terrible stage fright , " reese told us .
" it started off with about 100 people there , but by the last performance there were two and a half thousand . "
reese may not have sung in public before - but she did have one major advantage : she actually comes from nashville tennessee - and already knew exactly who june carter cash was .
" it was pretty daunting : i grew up knowing the history of june carter cash and her family , " she told us .
reece 's husband is also up for an oscar , in the race movie , crash .

in his state of the union speech , mr bush said he hoped that america would one day be a close ally of a free and democratic iran .
he said iran was a nation held hostage by a small clerical elite , an elite which was isolating and repressing the iranian people .
the president also renewed his demand that hamas lay down its weapons .
this was a speech aimed equally at america and the world .
it was a speech which was partly a rallying call to the domestic audience , with passionate passages about education and the need for americans to be true to the moral callings of their nation .
but it was also partly a re-statement of the bush doctrine : that democracy inoculates nations from the hatreds and madness which lead to war .
you might think that is true ; you might not .
but you know the president believes it .
liberty call the us , he said , would continue to confront the threat posed by tehran 's nuclear ambitions but he said he wanted to speak directly to the people of iran .
america , mr bush said , respects you .
we respect your right to choose your own future and win your own freedom .
america hoped one day to be the closest of friends with a democratic iran .
mr bush 's words were simultaneously translated into farsi on the state department website , an attempt at outreach which has never been tried before .
the president renewed his call for hamas to reject violence and recognise israel .
but mr bush did make it plain that he was not about to rein in his democratic project .
liberty , he said , was the future of every nation in the middle east .
but in what appeared to be a recognition that this might be difficult to achieve , mr bush went on to issue a stark warning to americans .
we are addicted to oil , he said - it was a serious problem which must be solved through the use of technology to find alternatives .

former london buses managing director peter hendy , 52 , who worked as a bus driver while a trainee , takes over the top job from bob kiley on wednesday .
preparing for the 2012 games will be just one item in a bulging in-tray .
" it 's a bit daunting , i think london expects a lot from its transport system , " he told bbc news .
" if you are in charge of delivering it , you should be a bit daunted . "
" i get lots of time to read stuff on the train " peter hendy the married father-of-two has plenty of first hand experience of the public transport network .
he has a four-hour daily commute between his home in bath , somerset , to transport for london 's -lrb- tfl -rrb- headquarters by way of a train and two buses .
" i get lots of time to read stuff on the train , " he said .
" i think anybody would say that we have still got a lot more to do , but on my daily journey , the bit within london has improved within the last five years . "
starting at london transport as a graduate trainee in 1975 , he did short stints as a bus conductor and driver , both based in hammersmith , west london , and later headed up bus firm centrewest and was uk bus deputy director for firstgroup .
from 2001 mr hendy was the boss of london buses , during the biggest package of improvements to bus services in central london in 50 years .
among some of his tasks in his new £ 320,000-a-year role will be trying to get the crossrail project off the ground as well as preparing london for the 2012 olympics .
" it 's really important that that stuff is on target and delivered - i think we have got a good chance of doing that , " he said .
he also hopes to oversee a five-year £ 10bn investment plan and hold the government and public private partnership -lrb- ppp -rrb- firms to their promises on modernising the ageing tube system .
mr hendy said he would be able to work with the firms - sometimes criticised by his predecessor - and had no objection to " people making a profit " . "
we have to make ppp work " peter hendy he added : " nobody i have met thinks it -lrb- ppp -rrb- was the best way of doing it , but we have got it and we have to make it work .
" our best bet is contractors who do a good job , who deliver what we want , on time . "
but he told bbc news that his main priority was more modest .
" every day we have got millions of people using our public transport , highways , walking and cycling , " he said .
" we have got to give them the best service we can .
we have n't got everything right , some things take much longer than others .
" the tube is under a competent management but it 's going to take a long time to repair the ravages of the lack of investment and neglect the system has suffered . "

former london buses managing director peter hendy , 52 , who worked as a bus driver while a trainee , takes over the top job from bob kiley on wednesday .
preparing for the 2012 games will be just one item in a bulging in-tray .
" it 's a bit daunting , i think london expects a lot from its transport system , " he told bbc news .
" if you are in charge of delivering it , you should be a bit daunted . "
i get lots of time to read stuff on the train peter hendy the married father-of-two has plenty of first hand experience of the public transport network .
he has a four-hour daily commute between his home in bath , somerset , to transport for london 's -lrb- tfl -rrb- headquarters by way of a train and two buses .
" i get lots of time to read stuff on the train , " he said .
" i think anybody would say that we have still got a lot more to do , but on my daily journey , the bit within london has improved within the last five years . "
starting at london transport as a graduate trainee in 1975 , he did short stints as a bus conductor and driver , both based in hammersmith , west london , and later headed up bus firm centrewest and was uk bus deputy director for firstgroup .
bob kiley had opposed the introduction of ppp on the tube from 2001 mr hendy was the boss of london buses , during the biggest package of improvements to bus services in central london in 50 years .
among some of his tasks in his new £ 320,000-a-year role will be trying to get the crossrail project off the ground as well as preparing london for the 2012 olympics .
" it 's really important that that stuff is on target and delivered - i think we have got a good chance of doing that , " he said .
he also hopes to oversee a five-year £ 10bn investment plan and hold the government and public private partnership -lrb- ppp -rrb- firms to their promises on modernising the ageing tube system .
mr hendy said he would be able to work with the firms - sometimes criticised by his predecessor - and had no objection to " people making a profit " .
we have to make ppp work peter hendy he added : " nobody i have met thinks it -lrb- ppp -rrb- was the best way of doing it , but we have got it and we have to make it work .
" our best bet is contractors who do a good job , who deliver what we want , on time . "
but he told bbc news that his main priority was more modest .
" every day we have got millions of people using our public transport , highways , walking and cycling , " he said .
" we have got to give them the best service we can .
we have n't got everything right , some things take much longer than others .
" the tube is under a competent management but it 's going to take a long time to repair the ravages of the lack of investment and neglect the system has suffered . "

former london buses managing director peter hendy , 52 , who worked as a bus driver while a trainee , takes over the top job from bob kiley on wednesday .
preparing for the 2012 games will be just one item in a bulging in-tray .
" it 's a bit daunting , i think london expects a lot from its transport system , " he told bbc news .
" if you are in charge of delivering it , you should be a bit daunted . "
i get lots of time to read stuff on the train peter hendy the married father-of-two has plenty of first hand experience of the public transport network .
he has a four-hour daily commute between his home in bath , somerset , to transport for london 's -lrb- tfl -rrb- headquarters by way of a train and two buses .
" i get lots of time to read stuff on the train , " he said .
" i think anybody would say that we have still got a lot more to do , but on my daily journey , the bit within london has improved within the last five years . "
starting at london transport as a graduate trainee in 1975 , he did short stints as a bus conductor and driver , both based in hammersmith , west london , and later headed up bus firm centrewest and was uk bus deputy director for firstgroup .
bob kiley had opposed the introduction of ppp on the tube from 2001 mr hendy was the boss of london buses , during the biggest package of improvements to bus services in central london in 50 years .
among some of his tasks in his new £ 320,000-a-year role will be trying to get the crossrail project off the ground as well as preparing london for the 2012 olympics .
" it 's really important that that stuff is on target and delivered - i think we have got a good chance of doing that , " he said .
he also hopes to oversee a five-year £ 10bn investment plan and hold the government and public private partnership -lrb- ppp -rrb- firms to their promises on modernising the ageing tube system .
mr hendy said he would be able to work with the firms - sometimes criticised by his predecessor - and had no objection to " people making a profit " .
we have to make ppp work peter hendy he added : " nobody i have met thinks it -lrb- ppp -rrb- was the best way of doing it , but we have got it and we have to make it work .
" our best bet is contractors who do a good job , who deliver what we want , on time . "
but he told bbc news that his main priority was more modest .
" every day we have got millions of people using our public transport , highways , walking and cycling , " he said .
" we have got to give them the best service we can .
we have n't got everything right , some things take much longer than others .
" the tube is under a competent management but it 's going to take a long time to repair the ravages of the lack of investment and neglect the system has suffered . "

president gloria arroyo 's government says raising the value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- rate from 10 % to 12 % is a key reform .
the tax hike is unpopular , but analysts say it is essential for the government to raise revenues and cut its debt .
they say the higher vat will raise the chances of the philippines getting an upgrade from credit rating agencies .
last year the agencies cut their outlooks to negative over concerns about delays to the reforms as the president battled allegations of vote rigging .
protests the government expects extra revenues of about $ 1.4bn -lrb- £ 790m -rrb- -rrb- this year after it expanded the items covered by vat last year , and then raised the rate on wednesday .
but the broader and higher tax has proved deeply unpopular as millions of impoverished filipinos try to cope with higher fuel , electricity and transport costs following a surge in global oil prices .
leftist groups held small protests around the country against the vat changes .
filipinos rushed to shops and petrol stations on tuesday to stock up before the rate went up .
when mrs arroyo was elected to a fresh term in 2004 she vowed to put the country 's financial house in order .
but if the economy is to see any real results , she must also improve tax collection , which , because of corruption and evasion , is among the lowest in asia .

the horror of the deaths has driven mrs pemberton 's brother , frank mullane , to try to prevent other such tragedies .
his efforts have already won an agreement , the first of its kind in the uk , to hold a review of the deaths to help shape future investigations .
we will not sign up to a whitewash or anything short of something that will help stop these murders frank mullane mr mullane , from swindon , wiltshire , is due to go to the high court on wednesday to fight for an overhaul of how the review will take place , before it has even got under way .
but the 44-year-old makes it clear he is not out to cause trouble , just to ensure that the probe brings real change .
he told the bbc news website : " we are not in it to be adversarial .
we are not in it for retribution , or to beat anyone up over it .
police delayed entering the house for several hours " the family want to be seen as progressive .
we want to create change .
" but we will not sign up to a whitewash or anything short of something that will help stop these murders . "
julia and william pemberton were killed at their home in hermitage , near newbury , berkshire .
mrs pemberton 's estranged husband alan , 48 , then turned the gun on himself .
at the time of the tragedy , mr pemberton was already the subject of a court order banning him from going anywhere near the family home .
at the inquest , which heard the transcript of mrs pemberton 's 999 call , east berkshire coroner peter bedford recorded verdicts of unlawful killing and said police could not have prevented their deaths .
something is broken and it needs fixing frank mullane but mr mullane has always claimed the murders only came after a series of incidents which he believes should have been recognised as clear alarm bells .
early last year , home office minister baroness scotland asked thames valley police to hold a formal homicide review into the tragedy .
originally set to begin last october , the inquiry was put on hold when mr mullane began legal action to widen its remit .
he wants a judicial review of its scope , to make sure his family - and other families in the future - can have their say , and provide vital information .
" families have information and insights about the various compromises victims of domestic violence have to make .
independent witnesses " we could give insights into how julia felt about the agencies ' response .
we could help them see the red flags , the larger risk indicators .
" we know two women get killed every week in england and wales and we feel we have a duty to use our experience to help bring about change . "
mr mullane also hopes the high court judge will back his desire for more independent witnesses to give evidence at the review .
he insists that , if successful , the review will help identify " clusters " of abuse cases where indicators of a possible tragedy could be found .
he does , however , remain realistic , saying he is " clear that we can not protect all of -lrb- the victims -rrb- " before simply adding : " but we believe something is broken and it needs fixing . "
a spokeswoman for the review 's commissioners - the west berkshire safer communities partnership , which includes police , the local authority and other agencies - declined to comment ahead of the court hearing .

oh my god , help me " - the last words of julia pemberton .
mrs pemberton and her 16-year-old son william were shot dead by her abusive husband in november 2003 .
the horror of the deaths has driven mrs pemberton 's brother , frank mullane , to try to prevent other such tragedies .
his efforts have already won an agreement , the first of its kind in the uk , to hold a review of the deaths to help shape future investigations .
we will not sign up to a whitewash or anything short of something that will help stop these murders frank mullane mr mullane , from swindon , wiltshire , is due to go to the high court on wednesday to fight for an overhaul of how the review will take place , before it has even got under way .
but the 44-year-old makes it clear he is not out to cause trouble , just to ensure that the probe brings real change .
he told the bbc news website : " we are not in it to be adversarial .
we are not in it for retribution , or to beat anyone up over it .
police delayed entering the house for several hours " the family want to be seen as progressive .
we want to create change .
" but we will not sign up to a whitewash or anything short of something that will help stop these murders . "
julia and william pemberton were killed at their home in hermitage , near newbury , berkshire .
mrs pemberton 's estranged husband alan , 48 , then turned the gun on himself .
at the time of the tragedy , mr pemberton was already the subject of a court order banning him from going anywhere near the family home .
at the inquest , which heard the transcript of mrs pemberton 's 999 call , east berkshire coroner peter bedford recorded verdicts of unlawful killing and said police could not have prevented their deaths .
something is broken and it needs fixing frank mullane but mr mullane has always claimed the murders only came after a series of incidents which he believes should have been recognised as clear alarm bells .
early last year , home office minister baroness scotland asked thames valley police to hold a formal homicide review into the tragedy .
originally set to begin last october , the inquiry was put on hold when mr mullane began legal action to widen its remit .
he wants a judicial review of its scope , to make sure his family - and other families in the future - can have their say , and provide vital information .
" families have information and insights about the various compromises victims of domestic violence have to make .
independent witnesses " we could give insights into how julia felt about the agencies ' response .
we could help them see the red flags , the larger risk indicators .
" we know two women get killed every week in england and wales and we feel we have a duty to use our experience to help bring about change . "
mr mullane also hopes the high court judge will back his desire for more independent witnesses to give evidence at the review .
he insists that , if successful , the review will help identify " clusters " of abuse cases where indicators of a possible tragedy could be found .
he does , however , remain realistic , saying he is " clear that we can not protect all of -lrb- the victims -rrb- " before simply adding : " but we believe something is broken and it needs fixing . "

his people were gravely affected by last year 's drought , but as he explains , he is determined to fight back .
last year , the earth was bare .
nothing grew .
there were no rains .
tchiena - a cold and strong wind - was blowing everywhere .
our animals had no shelter because there was no grass left .
our animals could not hide , their bellies were empty and they started shivering .
we tried to find bags of millet , there was no millet .
bags of groundnuts , there was no groundnuts .
beans - there were no beans .
those who had food benefited from our plight .
they sold it on to us at double the normal price .
a lot of elderly people died , as well as children who could not get milk .
last year , the nomads lost thousands of animals .
my family lost 59 - we 've only got 14 left .
this is why we 've stopped travelling .
we are all staying around the well i bought three years ago .
rains at last it 's very hard for a nomad to lose his animals .
he lives with them , can eat because of them , can buy clothes for his children because of them .
we also need animals to get married .
we can not live without them .
and we do n't know any other job .
animals are central to a nomad 's way of life if we lose our cattle - it 's very serious .
we do n't know where to go and what to do .
a lot of our youths have left their families to work for other people in towns .
a lot of people now rely on outside help for food .
since december 2004 we have been meeting regularly to try and find solutions .
a lot of europeans driving big luxury cars came to help us .
they did n't stay for very long - so they could not really grasp everything that was happening to us .
the situation has now improved - the rains came at last , so now our animals have enough pasture to eat .
but we have not been able to rebuild our herds yet - we need many more years of good rains and harvests before we can get back to where we were before the drought .
astonished i 'm now in france looking for people to sell our traditional goods such as embroidered shirts , jewellery and leather bags .
now that we have got no more cows , we need to find another way to earn our living .
but it is very difficult .
first , it was very hard to get a visa .
then , i was questioned by french customs officials for about an hour before they let me into the country .
i have been able to sell some goods but just to friends of friends , when they organise little exhbitions in their houses .
the other day , i was stopped in marseilles by some policemen , who asked me for my papers - and if i was selling drugs .
i was astonished .
we are not asking for europe 's help - we want to deal with them , as equals .

his people were gravely affected by last year 's drought , but as he explains , he is determined to fight back .
last year , the earth was bare .
nothing grew .
there were no rains .
tchiena - a cold and strong wind - was blowing everywhere .
our animals had no shelter because there was no grass left .
our animals could not hide , their bellies were empty and they started shivering .
we tried to find bags of millet , there was no millet .
bags of groundnuts , there was no groundnuts .
beans - there were no beans .
those who had food benefited from our plight .
they sold it on to us at double the normal price .
a lot of elderly people died , as well as children who could not get milk .
last year , the nomads lost thousands of animals .
my family lost 59 - we 've only got 14 left .
this is why we 've stopped travelling .
we are all staying around the well i bought three years ago .
rains at last it 's very hard for a nomad to lose his animals .
he lives with them , can eat because of them , can buy clothes for his children because of them .
we also need animals to get married .
we can not live without them .
and we do n't know any other job .
animals are central to a nomad 's way of life if we lose our cattle - it 's very serious .
we do n't know where to go and what to do .
a lot of our youths have left their families to work for other people in towns .
a lot of people now rely on outside help for food .
since december 2004 we have been meeting regularly to try and find solutions .
a lot of europeans driving big luxury cars came to help us .
they did n't stay for very long - so they could not really grasp everything that was happening to us .
the situation has now improved - the rains came at last , so now our animals have enough pasture to eat .
but we have not been able to rebuild our herds yet - we need many more years of good rains and harvests before we can get back to where we were before the drought .
astonished i 'm now in france looking for people to sell our traditional goods such as embroidered shirts , jewellery and leather bags .
now that we have got no more cows , we need to find another way to earn our living .
but it is very difficult .
first , it was very hard to get a visa .
then , i was questioned by french customs officials for about an hour before they let me into the country .
i have been able to sell some goods but just to friends of friends , when they organise little exhbitions in their houses .
the other day , i was stopped in marseilles by some policemen , who asked me for my papers - and if i was selling drugs .

only six out of every 10 are now freed within two days of eligibility dates , a national audit office report reveals .
prisons , courts and probation should improve the way offenders are assessed for early release , the report says .
it also suggests delays by the private tag-operating firms in reporting curfew breaches increases risks to the public .
securicor justice services and premier monitoring services failed to report nearly one out of every eight breaches to the home office within three days , increasing the risk an offender would abscond or commit further crime , the report says .
it took between eight days and two months to return more than one out of every four offenders who breached curfews to prison , the auditors found in a study of 290 cases . "
to ensure that a curfew is effective , it is essential that the contractors and criminal justice agencies work together to ensure that offenders are always tagged promptly and that any breaches of their curfew are dealt with quickly " national audit office head sir john bourn and for one out of every 10 offenders , it took between two months and a year .
the tagging scheme , which allows inmates to be freed up to 135 days early , is a " cost-effective " alternative to jail , the report says .
tagging an offender for 90 days was £ 5,200 cheaper than keeping them behind bars , it adds .
two auditors were tagged for a week as part of their investigation , keeping diaries of their movements to compare with the operating companies ' records .
curfew breaches national audit office head sir john bourn said : " electronic monitoring represents value for money , providing a cost-effective alternative to custody for offenders who do not pose a risk to the public .
" however , to ensure that a curfew is effective , it is essential that the contractors and criminal justice agencies work together to ensure that offenders are always tagged promptly and that any breaches of their curfew are dealt with quickly . "
a home office spokeswoman said : " although performance is generally very good , in some cases there are delays .
" better communication between the criminal justice agencies involved will do much to reduce these . "
a spokesman for serco , premier monitoring 's parent company , said : " we are always determined to improve our performance and have done so since the cases sampled by the national audit office , which date back as far as 2002 in some cases . "
it does feel as though you are still under surveillance , in a form of custody , because you have to obey the rules " former tory minister jonathan aitken " currently we are achieving 97 % compliance with our contractual targets for fitting tags and 100 % compliance for reporting breaches .
" we are pleased that this report recognises electronic monitoring has an important role to play in the criminal justice system and that the technology is robust and effective . "
former tory minister jonathan aitken served seven months of an 18-month sentence for perjury and perverting the course of justice before being tagged .
he told bbc news tagging was effective if properly enforced .
" it does feel as though you are still under surveillance , in a form of custody , because you have to obey the rules .
" you have to be in your home , from six in the evening until six in the morning - not a bad punishment at all for a middle-aged man who likes being at home with his family anyway , but quite a restriction for a young man who likes to go pubbing and clubbing . "

only six out of every 10 are now freed within two days of eligibility dates , a national audit office report reveals .
prisons , courts and probation should improve the way offenders are assessed for early release , the report says .
it also suggests delays by the private tag-operating firms in reporting curfew breaches increases risks to the public .
securicor justice services and premier monitoring services failed to report nearly one out of every eight breaches to the home office within three days , increasing the risk an offender would abscond or commit further crime , the report says .
it took between eight days and two months to return more than one out of every four offenders who breached curfews to prison , the auditors found in a study of 290 cases .
to ensure that a curfew is effective , it is essential that the contractors and criminal justice agencies work together to ensure that offenders are always tagged promptly and that any breaches of their curfew are dealt with quickly national audit office head sir john bourn and for one out of every 10 offenders , it took between two months and a year .
the tagging scheme , which allows inmates to be freed up to 135 days early , is a " cost-effective " alternative to jail , the report says .
tagging an offender for 90 days was £ 5,200 cheaper than keeping them behind bars , it adds .
two auditors were tagged for a week as part of their investigation , keeping diaries of their movements to compare with the operating companies ' records .

" however , to ensure that a curfew is effective , it is essential that the contractors and criminal justice agencies work together to ensure that offenders are always tagged promptly and that any breaches of their curfew are dealt with quickly . "
a home office spokeswoman said : " although performance is generally very good , in some cases there are delays .
" better communication between the criminal justice agencies involved will do much to reduce these . "
a spokesman for serco , premier monitoring 's parent company , said : " we are always determined to improve our performance and have done so since the cases sampled by the national audit office , which date back as far as 2002 in some cases .

former tory minister jonathan aitken served seven months of an 18-month sentence for perjury and perverting the course of justice before being tagged .
he told bbc news tagging was effective if properly enforced .

only six out of every 10 are now freed within two days of eligibility dates , a national audit office report reveals .
prisons , courts and probation should improve the way offenders are assessed for early release , the report says .
it also suggests delays by the private tag-operating firms in reporting curfew breaches increases risks to the public .
securicor justice services and premier monitoring services failed to report nearly one out of every eight breaches to the home office within three days , increasing the risk an offender would abscond or commit further crime , the report says .
it took between eight days and two months to return more than one out of every four offenders who breached curfews to prison , the auditors found in a study of 290 cases .
to ensure that a curfew is effective , it is essential that the contractors and criminal justice agencies work together to ensure that offenders are always tagged promptly and that any breaches of their curfew are dealt with quickly national audit office head sir john bourn and for one out of every 10 offenders , it took between two months and a year .
the tagging scheme , which allows inmates to be freed up to 135 days early , is a " cost-effective " alternative to jail , the report says .
tagging an offender for 90 days was £ 5,200 cheaper than keeping them behind bars , it adds .
two auditors were tagged for a week as part of their investigation , keeping diaries of their movements to compare with the operating companies ' records .
curfew breaches national audit office head sir john bourn said : " electronic monitoring represents value for money , providing a cost-effective alternative to custody for offenders who do not pose a risk to the public .
" however , to ensure that a curfew is effective , it is essential that the contractors and criminal justice agencies work together to ensure that offenders are always tagged promptly and that any breaches of their curfew are dealt with quickly . "
a home office spokeswoman said : " although performance is generally very good , in some cases there are delays .
" better communication between the criminal justice agencies involved will do much to reduce these . "
a spokesman for serco , premier monitoring 's parent company , said : " we are always determined to improve our performance and have done so since the cases sampled by the national audit office , which date back as far as 2002 in some cases .
it does feel as though you are still under surveillance , in a form of custody , because you have to obey the rules former tory minister jonathan aitken " currently we are achieving 97 % compliance with our contractual targets for fitting tags and 100 % compliance for reporting breaches .
" we are pleased that this report recognises electronic monitoring has an important role to play in the criminal justice system and that the technology is robust and effective . "
former tory minister jonathan aitken served seven months of an 18-month sentence for perjury and perverting the course of justice before being tagged .
he told bbc news tagging was effective if properly enforced .
" it does feel as though you are still under surveillance , in a form of custody , because you have to obey the rules .
" you have to be in your home , from six in the evening until six in the morning - not a bad punishment at all for a middle-aged man who likes being at home with his family anyway , but quite a restriction for a young man who likes to go pubbing and clubbing . "

when evita first hit the stage in 1978 , it broke west end box office records , made stars of its cast , spawned a hit single and confirmed the golden touch of composer andrew lloyd webber .
joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat and jesus christ superstar had already wowed theatre fans and cats , starlight express and the phantom of the opera were still to come .
lloyd webber now says evita was the high point of his partnership with lyricist tim rice , and he is getting rather enthusiastic about bringing it back .
the original ran until the mid-1980s and lloyd webber and rice decided it was not a good idea to revive it on the back of madonna 's star turn in the evita film in 1996 .
but everything has now fallen into place for a return , he says , and a dynamic director , michael grandage , has been found to revamp it with a modern touch .
authentically argentine with more opportunity to soak up latin american music than he had in the 1970s , he also wants to make the new show more authentically argentine .
helping him in that task is elena roger , the first argentine to play the country 's former first lady eva peron in the lead role . "
to have a girl who comes in with a fistful of tango albums which she wants me to hear is really pretty exciting " andrew lloyd webber lloyd webber and grandage auditioned " some really quite well-known actresses on both sides of the pond " , the composer says .
but in the end , they were all too influenced by previous evita stars - be it elaine paige or madonna - whereas roger was influenced only by eva " evita " peron herself .
" we 're very excited to have a girl who 's the real thing , " lloyd webber says .
" she came over to england under her own steam and contacted a girl in our office who is argentinian and she blew us away . "
the 31-year-old buenos aries native has a " strong view " of how peron should be portrayed , he says .
" although she 's far too young to have seen eva peron , i suppose it 's so much a part of argentine culture .
' best person ' " and from my point of view , looking at the orchestration , to have a girl who comes in with a fistful of tango albums which she wants me to hear is really pretty exciting because she can guide me . "
there was no temptation to recruit an established star to put more bums on seats , he says , adding he has always tried to pick the best person for the role .
as for the prospect of madonna reprising her film role , lloyd webber says he did not bother asking because she is too old and would be unable to commit to a west end run .
" i really do think madonna is extraordinary but i just know she would n't be interested in doing it , there 's just no point in talking to her about it , " he says .
as well as reworking the music for evita , lloyd webber is also preparing to put on the sound of music .
" i very passionately believe it 's never been done in the way rodgers and hammerstein intended it , " he says .
but that does not mean he is shying away from new work .
the receptions for his latest shows the woman in white , the beautiful game and bombay dreams were relatively disappointing - by lloyd webber 's standards .
no rush he freely admits he was " never really happy " with the computer-generated sets in the woman in white , which he did not produce and which is closing later this month .
he also says the current hungarian version of his football musical the beautiful game is " so much better than the london production " . "

lloyd webber said evita actress elena roger was " the real thing " when evita first hit the stage in 1978 , it broke west end box office records , made stars of its cast , spawned a hit single and confirmed the golden touch of composer andrew lloyd webber .
joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat and jesus christ superstar had already wowed theatre fans and cats , starlight express and the phantom of the opera were still to come .
lloyd webber now says evita was the high point of his partnership with lyricist tim rice , and he is getting rather enthusiastic about bringing it back .
the original ran until the mid-1980s and lloyd webber and rice decided it was not a good idea to revive it on the back of madonna 's star turn in the evita film in 1996 .
but everything has now fallen into place for a return , he says , and a dynamic director , michael grandage , has been found to revamp it with a modern touch .
authentically argentine with more opportunity to soak up latin american music than he had in the 1970s , he also wants to make the new show more authentically argentine .
helping him in that task is elena roger , the first argentine to play the country 's former first lady eva peron in the lead role .
to have a girl who comes in with a fistful of tango albums which she wants me to hear is really pretty exciting andrew lloyd webber lloyd webber and grandage auditioned " some really quite well-known actresses on both sides of the pond " , the composer says .
but in the end , they were all too influenced by previous evita stars - be it elaine paige or madonna - whereas roger was influenced only by eva " evita " peron herself .
" we 're very excited to have a girl who 's the real thing , " lloyd webber says .
" she came over to england under her own steam and contacted a girl in our office who is argentinian and she blew us away . "

president bush " tried to give his administration a new start " but while the spectacle of his speech was undimmed , many commentators saw in its ideas a president with his sails trimmed by harsh political and financial realities .
susan page , from the usa today newspaper , suggests that mr bush " strode into the house of representatives with the same texas-sized confidence as ever " .
yet she adds that " the substance of the proposals bush outlined reflected the realities of his sixth year in office ... the erosion of his job-approval rating , the constraints of a federal budget deficit ... the limits of the time left in his term and the costs of the war that divides the nation . "
the president , page writes , " launched a second start of his second term with a downsized domestic agenda and an acknowledgement that his presidency will be judged in large part by the outcome of the conflict in iraq " .
it is a view shared by dan balz from the washington post .
" coming off his most difficult year in office , president bush used his state of the union address last night to try to give his embattled administration a new start , speaking expansively about his aspirations for the final years of his presidency - but offering a scaled-down blueprint for governing , " balz writes .
" the president has never lacked for big ambitions ... and he restated many of them last night .
but his address lacked the rhetorical lift of some of his best efforts of the past , and the domestic policy agenda , although lengthy , included initiatives that have been around for some time .

' tough paragraph ' for the congressional quarterly magazine , it was a speech of " few risks " , that followed " a tumultuous year that left some of his domestic initiatives in tatters " .
but cnn political analyst jeff greenfield takes the view that mr bush had played to his strength with a speech tough on national security and the war on terror , and with domestic initiatives that would appeal to his conservative base .
it was significant that he focused on economic issues pushed hard by business , rather than on the social agenda of religious conservatives business week " all you have to remember about this state of the union address was one paragraph and two audience members , " greenfield says .

the two audience members were chief justice john roberts and just-confirmed justice sam alito .
" together they tell you all you need to know about how the president , and the republicans , intend to wage their fight to retain control of the congress this fall , " he adds , referring to the november mid-term elections .
business week magazine declares the president 's address : " a pro-business state of the union . "
it says mr bush 's domestic agenda " was dominated by an ' american competitiveness initiative ' that 's strongly supported by the vast majority of the business community , from large corporations to main street shops " .
" while only a few items on bush 's wish-list were new to a state of the union audience , it was significant that he focused on economic issues pushed hard by business , rather than on the social agenda of religious conservatives , " the magazine adds .

the newly formed wrexham , shropshire and marylebone railway company -lrb- wsmr -rrb- plans to run five trains a day between north-east wales and london from 2007 .
the company said the journey time would be cut to three hours 15 minutes .
travellers currently have to change trains in chester , crewe or birmingham for a train into london euston .
the planned service would stop in ruabon , chirk and gobowen as well as shrewsbury , telford , cosford and wolverhampton .
a spokesperson for wsmr said the company - a joint venture formed by renaissance trains ltd and laing rail - had been negotiating with network rail for some time .
we would expect the average fare to be £ 25 return mike jones , renaissance renaissance currently operates hull trains and laing has the chiltern railways franchise .
director of renaissance mike jones said plans for the service were " well underway " .
" we have an agreed timetable - not yet with network rail - but with train planners at laing rail who own chiltern railways .
" they have identified five paths to run services from shrewsbury and we believe it will be possible to extend those to wrexham , " he said .
anything that adds to the number of trains going from north wales into london is to be welcomed prof stuart cole , wales transport research centre he added that the fares being offered to passengers travelling on the route would be competitive .
" on the basis of our business plan , we would expect the average fare to be £ 25 return - that would be the average fare we would expect people to pay to make the service viable , " he said .
transport experts have welcomed the proposals saying that the new service could compete with the bigger rail companies including virgin rail .
professor stuart cole , director of wales transport research centre at the university of glamorgan said : " anything that adds to the number of trains going from north wales into the midlands of england and into london is to be welcomed .
" hull trains is an independent company that 's been successful and is still running its services - it 's found a niche and hopefully this is a niche that will be successful .
" there is a good chance they can pull a number of passengers away from that -lrb- virgin rail -rrb- service . "
wrexham mp ian lucas said that the service was long overdue for the area .
" i hope this will be a success , and it could take some of the pressure off the west coast main line , " he said .
