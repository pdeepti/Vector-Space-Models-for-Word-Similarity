the explosions that send the particles on their way largely remain a mystery to scientists , but they are hoping for added insight from a pair of satellites launched into space a few days go . " we are at the dawning of a new age of solar observations , " russ howard of the naval research laboratory said at a nasa news conference .
" we 're going to be viewing things in a new dimension for us . " while the sun 's surface appears to be a calm yellow disc , it 's actually an enormous and actively changing star that 's altered by massive explosions of electrified gas and particles known as coronal mass ejections .
while astronomers have long known of the ejections existence , studying their size and scope from the single angle provided by one satellite is difficult . broadside view of earth and sun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each of the satellites contains 16 pieces of scientific equipment after circling once around the moon to gain speed , the satellites will head in opposite directions - one ahead of the earth 's orbit and one behind - to provide a view of both the earth and sun when they settle into their final positions for the two-year mission . " the highly complicated cameras on board will make it possible to follow the explosions from the sun to the earth from two satellites at the same time , " said volker bothmer of the university of göttingen 's institute for astrophysics , who is organizing german participation in nasa 's stereo project . short for solar terrestrial relations observatory , the " space weather " project aims to see what effects the particle ejections - which can spread to a size of 30 million kilometers -lrb- nearly 19 million miles -rrb- - have on the earth . " we want to learn to understand how the solar storms are created , about their three-dimensional development between the sun and the earth and finally about their effects on the earth itself , " bothmer said . current satellite helpful , but not ideal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the particle ejections have the potential to destroy other satellites orbiting the earth information provided by the current satellite soho , created in cooperation by the americans and the europeans , often only gives vague clues that the particle ejections are racing toward earth , sometimes catching scientists by surprise when a wave of material washes over the planet . " what we know today is that from a small , localized region of the sun , magnetic loops spread into very large structures within minutes and move toward earth at speeds of up to 3,000 kilometers per second -lrb- 1,864 miles per second -rrb- , making the ejection 's period of time from sun to the earth range from a few days to a few hours , " bothmer said .
" the earth is like a needle that pokes through a massive bubble gum balloon . " and like anyone who has tried to pull bubblegum out of their hair , the explosions can also have serious consequences , including destruction of electronics on orbiting satellites and even possibly knocking out electricity on earth . at the end of the two-year , $ 550 million -lrb- 437 million euro -rrb- project , the " behind " spacecraft will be flung completely away from earth , and will become a satellite of the sun , while the " ahead " spacecraft will curve back to fly past the moon a second time six weeks later and then be flung out in the opposite direction . dirk lorenzen -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches satellite to boost climate research the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change .

" this is about many thousands of billions of euros and environmental markets that are going to be decisive in the 21st century , " he told reporters in berlin at the presentation of the paper called " memorandum for a new deal between business , environmental and employment . " he said gas-saving cars , clean power plants and recycling technologies must be recognized as the booming markets of the future and suggested creating an " industrial cabinet , " which would provide market stimuli for innovation in the green sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants germany to invest heavily in green technology gabriel said investing in environmental technologies would result in a " double dividend , " since it would protect the environment while earning green-oriented german firms billions . germany is already one of the world leaders in green technology , which puts the country in a strong position to lead in sectors such as renewable energy , fuel and energy-saving devices and clear power plants which produce very little or no carbon dioxide emissions , which are largely responsible for climate change . " instead of hindering markets and their growth , we have to refashion them in ecological and sustainable ways , " gabriel said . consequences of climate change could be " disastrous " gabriel 's policy paper coincides with a stark warning by former world bank chief economist sir nicholas stern that the world could face economic fallout in the future on the scale of the great depression of the 1930s if it did n't invest now in green taxes or emissions trading programs . in a report released in london on monday , stern singled out the united states , china and india as economic powerhouses whose backing is crucial for a global solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir nicholas stern did n't mince his words " there is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change , if we act now and act internationally , " he said , launching his 600-page report in london .
" the task is urgent .
delaying action even by a decade or two will take us into dangerous territory . " his message was backed by british prime minister tony blair , who was at the report 's launch in central london with his finance minister and likely successor gordon brown . " should we fail to rise to this challenge , i do n't believe we will be able to explain ourselves to future generations , " said blair , warning of " disastrous " consequences for the planet unless action was taken swiftly . inaction to prove costly the stern review estimates that worldwide inaction could cost the equivalent of between five and 20 percent of global gross domestic product every year , forever . by contrast , the cost of action is equivalent to one percent of gdp , a " manageable " increase equivalent to a one-time price increase of goods of one percent , stern said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spell of dry weather and high ozone levels has damaged trees to address the situation , the economist called for carbon pricing , policies to support low-carbon technologies and more education of individuals about how they can tackle climate change . he also advocated the expansion of international frameworks on emissions trading , technology cooperation , deforestation and adaptation to climate change to develop a co-ordinated approach to climate change . brown also announced that former us vice-president al gore , who earlier this year released " an inconvenient truth , " a documentary about climate change , will become one of his personal advisors on green issues . stern warned that global warming , if left unchecked , could lead to economic upheaval on the scale of the great depression , or climate catastrophes many times worse than last year 's hurricane katrina in the us . he also suggested that rich countries should pay more than poor ones to offset their higher levels of carbon emissions . " the poor countries will be hit earliest and hardest , " he said .
" it is only right that the rich countries should pay a little more . " his report is thought to be the first heavyweight contribution to the debate on climate change by an economist rather than a scientist . environmentalists hail study the study was welcomed by green groups and others . " the stern review is a wake-up call to the world , " said hans verolme , director of environmental group wwf 's global climate change program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the world is drying out the report " provides a step-change in the way we think about climate change , " said beverley darkin of the chatham house think tank in london . " it is no longer an issue to be tackled solely by those working on environment and science issues . " eu urged to do more european commission president jose manuel barroso said on monday that the eu must step up its own fight against global warming , saying at a conference in lisbon that he would unveil proposals next year to increase energy efficiency and step up the use of renewable energies . he also urged eu governments to open up debate on the use of nuclear energy . " we can not hide from the issue , " he said .
" a debate on nuclear energy in europe should not be taboo . " france produces almost 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants while germany , which relies on nuclear energy for 30 percent of its needs , plans to shut all nuclear power stations by 2021 .

the explosions that send the particles on their way largely remain a mystery to scientists , but they are hoping for added insight from a pair of satellites launched into space a few days go . " we are at the dawning of a new age of solar observations , " russ howard of the naval research laboratory said at a nasa news conference .
" we 're going to be viewing things in a new dimension for us . " while the sun 's surface appears to be a calm yellow disc , it 's actually an enormous and actively changing star that 's altered by massive explosions of electrified gas and particles known as coronal mass ejections .
while astronomers have long known of the ejections existence , studying their size and scope from the single angle provided by one satellite is difficult . broadside view of earth and sun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each of the satellites contains 16 pieces of scientific equipment after circling once around the moon to gain speed , the satellites will head in opposite directions - one ahead of the earth 's orbit and one behind - to provide a view of both the earth and sun when they settle into their final positions for the two-year mission . " the highly complicated cameras on board will make it possible to follow the explosions from the sun to the earth from two satellites at the same time , " said volker bothmer of the university of göttingen 's institute for astrophysics , who is organizing german participation in nasa 's stereo project . short for solar terrestrial relations observatory , the " space weather " project aims to see what effects the particle ejections - which can spread to a size of 30 million kilometers -lrb- nearly 19 million miles -rrb- - have on the earth . " we want to learn to understand how the solar storms are created , about their three-dimensional development between the sun and the earth and finally about their effects on the earth itself , " bothmer said . current satellite helpful , but not ideal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the particle ejections have the potential to destroy other satellites orbiting the earth information provided by the current satellite soho , created in cooperation by the americans and the europeans , often only gives vague clues that the particle ejections are racing toward earth , sometimes catching scientists by surprise when a wave of material washes over the planet . " what we know today is that from a small , localized region of the sun , magnetic loops spread into very large structures within minutes and move toward earth at speeds of up to 3,000 kilometers per second -lrb- 1,864 miles per second -rrb- , making the ejection 's period of time from sun to the earth range from a few days to a few hours , " bothmer said .
" the earth is like a needle that pokes through a massive bubble gum balloon . " and like anyone who has tried to pull bubblegum out of their hair , the explosions can also have serious consequences , including destruction of electronics on orbiting satellites and even possibly knocking out electricity on earth . at the end of the two-year , $ 550 million -lrb- 437 million euro -rrb- project , the " behind " spacecraft will be flung completely away from earth , and will become a satellite of the sun , while the " ahead " spacecraft will curve back to fly past the moon a second time six weeks later and then be flung out in the opposite direction . dirk lorenzen -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe launches satellite to boost climate research the most complex earth observation satellite ever to be placed into orbit is to be launched monday as part of a 15-year program to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting and our understanding of climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 30.10.2006 war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski reaffirmed familiar stances during their meeting on monday germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .
but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

" this is about many thousands of billions of euros and environmental markets that are going to be decisive in the 21st century , " he told reporters in berlin at the presentation of the paper called " memorandum for a new deal between business , environmental and employment . " he said gas-saving cars , clean power plants and recycling technologies must be recognized as the booming markets of the future and suggested creating an " industrial cabinet , " which would provide market stimuli for innovation in the green sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants germany to invest heavily in green technology gabriel said investing in environmental technologies would result in a " double dividend , " since it would protect the environment while earning green-oriented german firms billions . germany is already one of the world leaders in green technology , which puts the country in a strong position to lead in sectors such as renewable energy , fuel and energy-saving devices and clear power plants which produce very little or no carbon dioxide emissions , which are largely responsible for climate change . " instead of hindering markets and their growth , we have to refashion them in ecological and sustainable ways , " gabriel said . consequences of climate change could be " disastrous " gabriel 's policy paper coincides with a stark warning by former world bank chief economist sir nicholas stern that the world could face economic fallout in the future on the scale of the great depression of the 1930s if it did n't invest now in green taxes or emissions trading programs . in a report released in london on monday , stern singled out the united states , china and india as economic powerhouses whose backing is crucial for a global solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir nicholas stern did n't mince his words " there is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change , if we act now and act internationally , " he said , launching his 600-page report in london .
" the task is urgent .
delaying action even by a decade or two will take us into dangerous territory . " his message was backed by british prime minister tony blair , who was at the report 's launch in central london with his finance minister and likely successor gordon brown . " should we fail to rise to this challenge , i do n't believe we will be able to explain ourselves to future generations , " said blair , warning of " disastrous " consequences for the planet unless action was taken swiftly . inaction to prove costly the stern review estimates that worldwide inaction could cost the equivalent of between five and 20 percent of global gross domestic product every year , forever . by contrast , the cost of action is equivalent to one percent of gdp , a " manageable " increase equivalent to a one-time price increase of goods of one percent , stern said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spell of dry weather and high ozone levels has damaged trees to address the situation , the economist called for carbon pricing , policies to support low-carbon technologies and more education of individuals about how they can tackle climate change . he also advocated the expansion of international frameworks on emissions trading , technology cooperation , deforestation and adaptation to climate change to develop a co-ordinated approach to climate change . brown also announced that former us vice-president al gore , who earlier this year released " an inconvenient truth , " a documentary about climate change , will become one of his personal advisors on green issues . stern warned that global warming , if left unchecked , could lead to economic upheaval on the scale of the great depression , or climate catastrophes many times worse than last year 's hurricane katrina in the us . he also suggested that rich countries should pay more than poor ones to offset their higher levels of carbon emissions . " the poor countries will be hit earliest and hardest , " he said .
" it is only right that the rich countries should pay a little more . " his report is thought to be the first heavyweight contribution to the debate on climate change by an economist rather than a scientist . environmentalists hail study the study was welcomed by green groups and others . " the stern review is a wake-up call to the world , " said hans verolme , director of environmental group wwf 's global climate change program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the world is drying out the report " provides a step-change in the way we think about climate change , " said beverley darkin of the chatham house think tank in london . " it is no longer an issue to be tackled solely by those working on environment and science issues . " eu urged to do more european commission president jose manuel barroso said on monday that the eu must step up its own fight against global warming , saying at a conference in lisbon that he would unveil proposals next year to increase energy efficiency and step up the use of renewable energies . he also urged eu governments to open up debate on the use of nuclear energy . " we can not hide from the issue , " he said .
" a debate on nuclear energy in europe should not be taboo . " france produces almost 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants while germany , which relies on nuclear energy for 30 percent of its needs , plans to shut all nuclear power stations by 2021 .

the federal office for radiation protection must first approve the transport .
safety experts and environmentalists have expressed concerns about the plans .
they said the risks involved in transporting radioactive materials by air instead of by train , the most common means of transportation , could be higher . " we have always stood against transporting nuclear waste by air , " said heinz smital , a greenpeace nuclear expert based in hamburg .
" the consequences of an air attack or accident on a plane carrying radioactive material are unpredictable .
uranium , which has been 80 percent enriched , can be weapons grade , " he added . although the nuclear material to be transported on dec .
1 contains only 36 percent uranium , it could easily become a " dirty bomb " in the wrong hands , smital told die welt daily . air transport more vulnerable security experts say that air transport is particularly vulnerable to an international terrorist attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste transports in germany are usually accompanied by protests " arrangements for transporting material and security procedures are outlined in great detail in agreements with contractors .
if such information is ever leaked to outsiders , potential terrorists could easily get their hands on radioactive materials , " said a high level national security official . the 200-kilogram load of nuclear waste was produced by a former soviet reactor in rossendorf , on the outskirts of dresden , and was shut down after german reunification in 1991 .
under a cold war agreement by the international atomic energy agency , nuclear material is supposed to be returned to its country of origin . special plane to transport uranium other experts say that a specially adapted plane for transporting uranium enriched material is safer than by train . " that way less can happen to it than on the road or on train tracks , " udo helwig , the director of the german association for nuclear technology and analysis -lrb- vkta -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . using aircraft was an economical means of transport , an environmental ministry spokesman thomas hagbeck suggested .
" considering the length of the trip , it makes sense to use air transport , " he said . since 2003 , there have been four air shipments of german nuclear waste to russia . preparations to take weeks since mainly non-reactive uranium is being sent back , the dangers from radioactivity should be minimal , according to helwig .
the waste will be brought to the dresden airport in a secure container truck , with the flight being organized by the russians themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian activists protest nuclear waste dumping preparations for flying the waste will take four weeks and would need to undergo vigorous international safety criteria .
the waste will be returned to the russian atomic reactor in podolsk , which is about 30 kilometers -lrb- around 19 miles -rrb- south of moscow , where it will be reprocessed for further use .

" our decision to increase our order has been made after an extensive review of the recent problems at airbus , " qantas chief executive geoff dixon said in a statement . " we are convinced that these problems relate to industrialization issues at airbus and will be remedied , and in no way relate to the technical capacity of the a380 . " airbus parent , the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , announced earlier this month that production problems had forced it to delay a380 deliveries by another year on average , the third setback for the program since june 2005 . airbus has also sharply revised down its profit targets for the a380 project , saying it will now have to sell 420 planes to break even instead of 270 as previously announced .
the qantas order brings to 167 the total of a380s sold so far by airbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting the final touches on the a380 has been a giant headache for airbus " the a380 has breakthrough technology and everything we have seen reinforces our view that it is the best available aircraft for qantas , " dixon said . the a380s will be deployed on dense long-haul routes from australia to the united states , britain , europe and possibly the middle east .
the 20 airliners are due to be delivered between august 2008 and 2015 .
qantas has an option for 12 more of the superjumbo jets . the a380 has a list price of around $ 280 million -lrb- 220 million euros -rrb- and can carry 555 passengers . dixon said the terms of the new contract provided , among other things , protection against any further delay in the a380 delivery schedule . boeing , too qantas had also contracted with boeing to acquire up to 115 b787 " dreamliner " aircraft from 2008 , dixon noted , saying the new generation aircraft had " the very latest technology for aircraft in the 300-seater range . " " the boeing 787 and the airbus a380 both have up to 20 percent lower operating costs than existing aircraft and will form the nucleus of the fleets out to 2015 for qantas and our low-cost airline jetstar , " dixon said . qantas would use a combination of outright purchase and operating leases in acquiring the aircraft . " all the costs of these new aircraft will be met by operating cash flows , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 's first flight qantas had also decided to buy five more boeing 737-800 aircraft for delivery from february 2008 .
qantas this month upgraded its full year earnings guidance in a statement to the airline 's annual general meeting . " given recent improvements in our trading conditions , we now expect the current year 's results to exceed last year 's , " qantas chair margaret jackson told shareholders . qantas reported a net profit of $ 3.63 million for the year to june - a 30 percent slump over the previous year which was blamed on spiralling fuel costs . emirates audit on monday , airbus said that it was not worried by a visit by auditors from emirates airlines to check on the progress of its a380 superjumbo jets on order .
emirates is the a380 's biggest customer , having ordered 43 planes worth $ 13 billion . airbus press officer justin dubon told the associated press that it was " something agreed to at the time of christina streiff , the former ceo who was replaced on oct .

but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .

but when the love potion she bought from a witch did n't work , she demanded her money back .
she got it . when a lover leaves , the person left behind can sometimes resort to drastic measures .
one german woman in just such a situation did n't take the stalking route or throw herself off a cliff .
she went to a self-professed " love witch , " who she hired to use magical means to force her ex to change his mind . the heartbroken woman paid 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,270 -rrb- for a love potion , which involved a ritual carried out over several months during the full moon . however , her former lover 's heart remained cold as a stone .

" this is about many thousands of billions of euros and environmental markets that are going to be decisive in the 21st century , " he told reporters in berlin at the presentation of the paper called " memorandum for a new deal between business , environmental and employment . " he said gas-saving cars , clean power plants and recycling technologies must be recognized as the booming markets of the future and suggested creating an " industrial cabinet , " which would provide market stimuli for innovation in the green sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants germany to invest heavily in green technology gabriel said investing in environmental technologies would result in a " double dividend , " since it would protect the environment while earning green-oriented german firms billions . germany is already one of the world leaders in green technology , which puts the country in a strong position to lead in sectors such as renewable energy , fuel and energy-saving devices and clear power plants which produce very little or no carbon dioxide emissions , which are largely responsible for climate change . " instead of hindering markets and their growth , we have to refashion them in ecological and sustainable ways , " gabriel said . consequences of climate change could be " disastrous " gabriel 's policy paper coincides with a stark warning by former world bank chief economist sir nicholas stern that the world could face economic fallout in the future on the scale of the great depression of the 1930s if it did n't invest now in green taxes or emissions trading programs . in a report released in london on monday , stern singled out the united states , china and india as economic powerhouses whose backing is crucial for a global solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir nicholas stern did n't mince his words " there is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change , if we act now and act internationally , " he said , launching his 600-page report in london .
" the task is urgent .
delaying action even by a decade or two will take us into dangerous territory . " his message was backed by british prime minister tony blair , who was at the report 's launch in central london with his finance minister and likely successor gordon brown . " should we fail to rise to this challenge , i do n't believe we will be able to explain ourselves to future generations , " said blair , warning of " disastrous " consequences for the planet unless action was taken swiftly . inaction to prove costly the stern review estimates that worldwide inaction could cost the equivalent of between five and 20 percent of global gross domestic product every year , forever . by contrast , the cost of action is equivalent to one percent of gdp , a " manageable " increase equivalent to a one-time price increase of goods of one percent , stern said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spell of dry weather and high ozone levels has damaged trees to address the situation , the economist called for carbon pricing , policies to support low-carbon technologies and more education of individuals about how they can tackle climate change . he also advocated the expansion of international frameworks on emissions trading , technology cooperation , deforestation and adaptation to climate change to develop a co-ordinated approach to climate change . brown also announced that former us vice-president al gore , who earlier this year released " an inconvenient truth , " a documentary about climate change , will become one of his personal advisors on green issues . stern warned that global warming , if left unchecked , could lead to economic upheaval on the scale of the great depression , or climate catastrophes many times worse than last year 's hurricane katrina in the us . he also suggested that rich countries should pay more than poor ones to offset their higher levels of carbon emissions . " the poor countries will be hit earliest and hardest , " he said .
" it is only right that the rich countries should pay a little more . " his report is thought to be the first heavyweight contribution to the debate on climate change by an economist rather than a scientist . environmentalists hail study the study was welcomed by green groups and others . " the stern review is a wake-up call to the world , " said hans verolme , director of environmental group wwf 's global climate change program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the world is drying out the report " provides a step-change in the way we think about climate change , " said beverley darkin of the chatham house think tank in london . " it is no longer an issue to be tackled solely by those working on environment and science issues . " eu urged to do more european commission president jose manuel barroso said on monday that the eu must step up its own fight against global warming , saying at a conference in lisbon that he would unveil proposals next year to increase energy efficiency and step up the use of renewable energies . he also urged eu governments to open up debate on the use of nuclear energy . " we can not hide from the issue , " he said .
" a debate on nuclear energy in europe should not be taboo . " france produces almost 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants while germany , which relies on nuclear energy for 30 percent of its needs , plans to shut all nuclear power stations by 2021 .

" our decision to increase our order has been made after an extensive review of the recent problems at airbus , " qantas chief executive geoff dixon said in a statement . " we are convinced that these problems relate to industrialization issues at airbus and will be remedied , and in no way relate to the technical capacity of the a380 . " airbus parent , the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , announced earlier this month that production problems had forced it to delay a380 deliveries by another year on average , the third setback for the program since june 2005 . airbus has also sharply revised down its profit targets for the a380 project , saying it will now have to sell 420 planes to break even instead of 270 as previously announced .

" this is about many thousands of billions of euros and environmental markets that are going to be decisive in the 21st century , " he told reporters in berlin at the presentation of the paper called " memorandum for a new deal between business , environmental and employment . " he said gas-saving cars , clean power plants and recycling technologies must be recognized as the booming markets of the future and suggested creating an " industrial cabinet , " which would provide market stimuli for innovation in the green sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants germany to invest heavily in green technology gabriel said investing in environmental technologies would result in a " double dividend , " since it would protect the environment while earning green-oriented german firms billions . germany is already one of the world leaders in green technology , which puts the country in a strong position to lead in sectors such as renewable energy , fuel and energy-saving devices and clear power plants which produce very little or no carbon dioxide emissions , which are largely responsible for climate change . " instead of hindering markets and their growth , we have to refashion them in ecological and sustainable ways , " gabriel said . consequences of climate change could be " disastrous " gabriel 's policy paper coincides with a stark warning by former world bank chief economist sir nicholas stern that the world could face economic fallout in the future on the scale of the great depression of the 1930s if it did n't invest now in green taxes or emissions trading programs . in a report released in london on monday , stern singled out the united states , china and india as economic powerhouses whose backing is crucial for a global solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir nicholas stern did n't mince his words " there is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change , if we act now and act internationally , " he said , launching his 600-page report in london .
" the task is urgent .
delaying action even by a decade or two will take us into dangerous territory . " his message was backed by british prime minister tony blair , who was at the report 's launch in central london with his finance minister and likely successor gordon brown . " should we fail to rise to this challenge , i do n't believe we will be able to explain ourselves to future generations , " said blair , warning of " disastrous " consequences for the planet unless action was taken swiftly . inaction to prove costly the stern review estimates that worldwide inaction could cost the equivalent of between five and 20 percent of global gross domestic product every year , forever . by contrast , the cost of action is equivalent to one percent of gdp , a " manageable " increase equivalent to a one-time price increase of goods of one percent , stern said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spell of dry weather and high ozone levels has damaged trees to address the situation , the economist called for carbon pricing , policies to support low-carbon technologies and more education of individuals about how they can tackle climate change . he also advocated the expansion of international frameworks on emissions trading , technology cooperation , deforestation and adaptation to climate change to develop a co-ordinated approach to climate change . brown also announced that former us vice-president al gore , who earlier this year released " an inconvenient truth , " a documentary about climate change , will become one of his personal advisors on green issues . stern warned that global warming , if left unchecked , could lead to economic upheaval on the scale of the great depression , or climate catastrophes many times worse than last year 's hurricane katrina in the us . he also suggested that rich countries should pay more than poor ones to offset their higher levels of carbon emissions . " the poor countries will be hit earliest and hardest , " he said .
" it is only right that the rich countries should pay a little more . " his report is thought to be the first heavyweight contribution to the debate on climate change by an economist rather than a scientist . environmentalists hail study the study was welcomed by green groups and others . " the stern review is a wake-up call to the world , " said hans verolme , director of environmental group wwf 's global climate change program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the world is drying out the report " provides a step-change in the way we think about climate change , " said beverley darkin of the chatham house think tank in london . " it is no longer an issue to be tackled solely by those working on environment and science issues . " eu urged to do more european commission president jose manuel barroso said on monday that the eu must step up its own fight against global warming , saying at a conference in lisbon that he would unveil proposals next year to increase energy efficiency and step up the use of renewable energies . he also urged eu governments to open up debate on the use of nuclear energy . " we can not hide from the issue , " he said .
" a debate on nuclear energy in europe should not be taboo . " france produces almost 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants while germany , which relies on nuclear energy for 30 percent of its needs , plans to shut all nuclear power stations by 2021 .

the federal office for radiation protection must first approve the transport .
safety experts and environmentalists have expressed concerns about the plans .
they said the risks involved in transporting radioactive materials by air instead of by train , the most common means of transportation , could be higher . " we have always stood against transporting nuclear waste by air , " said heinz smital , a greenpeace nuclear expert based in hamburg .
" the consequences of an air attack or accident on a plane carrying radioactive material are unpredictable .
uranium , which has been 80 percent enriched , can be weapons grade , " he added . although the nuclear material to be transported on dec .

if such information is ever leaked to outsiders , potential terrorists could easily get their hands on radioactive materials , " said a high level national security official . the 200-kilogram load of nuclear waste was produced by a former soviet reactor in rossendorf , on the outskirts of dresden , and was shut down after german reunification in 1991 .
under a cold war agreement by the international atomic energy agency , nuclear material is supposed to be returned to its country of origin . special plane to transport uranium other experts say that a specially adapted plane for transporting uranium enriched material is safer than by train . " that way less can happen to it than on the road or on train tracks , " udo helwig , the director of the german association for nuclear technology and analysis -lrb- vkta -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . using aircraft was an economical means of transport , an environmental ministry spokesman thomas hagbeck suggested .
" considering the length of the trip , it makes sense to use air transport , " he said . since 2003 , there have been four air shipments of german nuclear waste to russia . preparations to take weeks since mainly non-reactive uranium is being sent back , the dangers from radioactivity should be minimal , according to helwig .
the waste will be brought to the dresden airport in a secure container truck , with the flight being organized by the russians themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian activists protest nuclear waste dumping preparations for flying the waste will take four weeks and would need to undergo vigorous international safety criteria .
the waste will be returned to the russian atomic reactor in podolsk , which is about 30 kilometers -lrb- around 19 miles -rrb- south of moscow , where it will be reprocessed for further use .

but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

the explosions that send the particles on their way largely remain a mystery to scientists , but they are hoping for added insight from a pair of satellites launched into space a few days go . " we are at the dawning of a new age of solar observations , " russ howard of the naval research laboratory said at a nasa news conference .
" we 're going to be viewing things in a new dimension for us . " while the sun 's surface appears to be a calm yellow disc , it 's actually an enormous and actively changing star that 's altered by massive explosions of electrified gas and particles known as coronal mass ejections .
while astronomers have long known of the ejections existence , studying their size and scope from the single angle provided by one satellite is difficult . broadside view of earth and sun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : each of the satellites contains 16 pieces of scientific equipment after circling once around the moon to gain speed , the satellites will head in opposite directions - one ahead of the earth 's orbit and one behind - to provide a view of both the earth and sun when they settle into their final positions for the two-year mission .

but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university .

but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

" this is about many thousands of billions of euros and environmental markets that are going to be decisive in the 21st century , " he told reporters in berlin at the presentation of the paper called " memorandum for a new deal between business , environmental and employment . " he said gas-saving cars , clean power plants and recycling technologies must be recognized as the booming markets of the future and suggested creating an " industrial cabinet , " which would provide market stimuli for innovation in the green sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants germany to invest heavily in green technology gabriel said investing in environmental technologies would result in a " double dividend , " since it would protect the environment while earning green-oriented german firms billions . germany is already one of the world leaders in green technology , which puts the country in a strong position to lead in sectors such as renewable energy , fuel and energy-saving devices and clear power plants which produce very little or no carbon dioxide emissions , which are largely responsible for climate change . " instead of hindering markets and their growth , we have to refashion them in ecological and sustainable ways , " gabriel said . consequences of climate change could be " disastrous " gabriel 's policy paper coincides with a stark warning by former world bank chief economist sir nicholas stern that the world could face economic fallout in the future on the scale of the great depression of the 1930s if it did n't invest now in green taxes or emissions trading programs . in a report released in london on monday , stern singled out the united states , china and india as economic powerhouses whose backing is crucial for a global solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir nicholas stern did n't mince his words " there is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change , if we act now and act internationally , " he said , launching his 600-page report in london .
" the task is urgent .
delaying action even by a decade or two will take us into dangerous territory . " his message was backed by british prime minister tony blair , who was at the report 's launch in central london with his finance minister and likely successor gordon brown . " should we fail to rise to this challenge , i do n't believe we will be able to explain ourselves to future generations , " said blair , warning of " disastrous " consequences for the planet unless action was taken swiftly . inaction to prove costly the stern review estimates that worldwide inaction could cost the equivalent of between five and 20 percent of global gross domestic product every year , forever . by contrast , the cost of action is equivalent to one percent of gdp , a " manageable " increase equivalent to a one-time price increase of goods of one percent , stern said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spell of dry weather and high ozone levels has damaged trees to address the situation , the economist called for carbon pricing , policies to support low-carbon technologies and more education of individuals about how they can tackle climate change . he also advocated the expansion of international frameworks on emissions trading , technology cooperation , deforestation and adaptation to climate change to develop a co-ordinated approach to climate change . brown also announced that former us vice-president al gore , who earlier this year released " an inconvenient truth , " a documentary about climate change , will become one of his personal advisors on green issues . stern warned that global warming , if left unchecked , could lead to economic upheaval on the scale of the great depression , or climate catastrophes many times worse than last year 's hurricane katrina in the us . he also suggested that rich countries should pay more than poor ones to offset their higher levels of carbon emissions . " the poor countries will be hit earliest and hardest , " he said .
" it is only right that the rich countries should pay a little more . " his report is thought to be the first heavyweight contribution to the debate on climate change by an economist rather than a scientist . environmentalists hail study the study was welcomed by green groups and others . " the stern review is a wake-up call to the world , " said hans verolme , director of environmental group wwf 's global climate change program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the world is drying out the report " provides a step-change in the way we think about climate change , " said beverley darkin of the chatham house think tank in london . " it is no longer an issue to be tackled solely by those working on environment and science issues . " eu urged to do more european commission president jose manuel barroso said on monday that the eu must step up its own fight against global warming , saying at a conference in lisbon that he would unveil proposals next year to increase energy efficiency and step up the use of renewable energies . he also urged eu governments to open up debate on the use of nuclear energy . " we can not hide from the issue , " he said .
" a debate on nuclear energy in europe should not be taboo . " france produces almost 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants while germany , which relies on nuclear energy for 30 percent of its needs , plans to shut all nuclear power stations by 2021 .
however , chancellor angela merkel said last week she thought the plan was unwise . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany puts global warming prevention plan in gear german environment minister sigmar gabriel has warned of the unexpectedly fast pace of global warming and said the country needs to follow a unified plan to protect itself from increasing environment change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 30.10.2006 war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski reaffirmed familiar stances during their meeting on monday germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .
but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the clock is ticking eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions germany in top five countries fighting climate change germany boosts investment in climate change research interviews : the united nations and climate change environment -pipe- 30.10.2006 minister presses climate change action in wake of dire report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the consequences for the global economy are serious on the heels of a major study that says world leaders must act urgently to avert a looming environmental catastrophe , germany 's environment minister has called on the country to invest heavily in green technology . in a new strategy paper released by germany 's environment minister on monday , sigmar gabriel said new technologies in the fight against climate change and environmental pollution should become a central pillar of the german economy . " this is about many thousands of billions of euros and environmental markets that are going to be decisive in the 21st century , " he told reporters in berlin at the presentation of the paper called " memorandum for a new deal between business , environmental and employment . " he said gas-saving cars , clean power plants and recycling technologies must be recognized as the booming markets of the future and suggested creating an " industrial cabinet , " which would provide market stimuli for innovation in the green sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants germany to invest heavily in green technology gabriel said investing in environmental technologies would result in a " double dividend , " since it would protect the environment while earning green-oriented german firms billions . germany is already one of the world leaders in green technology , which puts the country in a strong position to lead in sectors such as renewable energy , fuel and energy-saving devices and clear power plants which produce very little or no carbon dioxide emissions , which are largely responsible for climate change . " instead of hindering markets and their growth , we have to refashion them in ecological and sustainable ways , " gabriel said . consequences of climate change could be " disastrous " gabriel 's policy paper coincides with a stark warning by former world bank chief economist sir nicholas stern that the world could face economic fallout in the future on the scale of the great depression of the 1930s if it did n't invest now in green taxes or emissions trading programs . in a report released in london on monday , stern singled out the united states , china and india as economic powerhouses whose backing is crucial for a global solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir nicholas stern did n't mince his words " there is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change , if we act now and act internationally , " he said , launching his 600-page report in london .
" the task is urgent .
delaying action even by a decade or two will take us into dangerous territory . " his message was backed by british prime minister tony blair , who was at the report 's launch in central london with his finance minister and likely successor gordon brown . " should we fail to rise to this challenge , i do n't believe we will be able to explain ourselves to future generations , " said blair , warning of " disastrous " consequences for the planet unless action was taken swiftly . inaction to prove costly the stern review estimates that worldwide inaction could cost the equivalent of between five and 20 percent of global gross domestic product every year , forever . by contrast , the cost of action is equivalent to one percent of gdp , a " manageable " increase equivalent to a one-time price increase of goods of one percent , stern said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spell of dry weather and high ozone levels has damaged trees to address the situation , the economist called for carbon pricing , policies to support low-carbon technologies and more education of individuals about how they can tackle climate change . he also advocated the expansion of international frameworks on emissions trading , technology cooperation , deforestation and adaptation to climate change to develop a co-ordinated approach to climate change . brown also announced that former us vice-president al gore , who earlier this year released " an inconvenient truth , " a documentary about climate change , will become one of his personal advisors on green issues . stern warned that global warming , if left unchecked , could lead to economic upheaval on the scale of the great depression , or climate catastrophes many times worse than last year 's hurricane katrina in the us . he also suggested that rich countries should pay more than poor ones to offset their higher levels of carbon emissions . " the poor countries will be hit earliest and hardest , " he said .
" it is only right that the rich countries should pay a little more . " his report is thought to be the first heavyweight contribution to the debate on climate change by an economist rather than a scientist . environmentalists hail study the study was welcomed by green groups and others . " the stern review is a wake-up call to the world , " said hans verolme , director of environmental group wwf 's global climate change program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the world is drying out the report " provides a step-change in the way we think about climate change , " said beverley darkin of the chatham house think tank in london . " it is no longer an issue to be tackled solely by those working on environment and science issues . " eu urged to do more european commission president jose manuel barroso said on monday that the eu must step up its own fight against global warming , saying at a conference in lisbon that he would unveil proposals next year to increase energy efficiency and step up the use of renewable energies . he also urged eu governments to open up debate on the use of nuclear energy .

" should we fail to rise to this challenge , i do n't believe we will be able to explain ourselves to future generations , " said blair , warning of " disastrous " consequences for the planet unless action was taken swiftly . inaction to prove costly the stern review estimates that worldwide inaction could cost the equivalent of between five and 20 percent of global gross domestic product every year , forever . by contrast , the cost of action is equivalent to one percent of gdp , a " manageable " increase equivalent to a one-time price increase of goods of one percent , stern said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spell of dry weather and high ozone levels has damaged trees to address the situation , the economist called for carbon pricing , policies to support low-carbon technologies and more education of individuals about how they can tackle climate change . he also advocated the expansion of international frameworks on emissions trading , technology cooperation , deforestation and adaptation to climate change to develop a co-ordinated approach to climate change . brown also announced that former us vice-president al gore , who earlier this year released " an inconvenient truth , " a documentary about climate change , will become one of his personal advisors on green issues . stern warned that global warming , if left unchecked , could lead to economic upheaval on the scale of the great depression , or climate catastrophes many times worse than last year 's hurricane katrina in the us . he also suggested that rich countries should pay more than poor ones to offset their higher levels of carbon emissions . " the poor countries will be hit earliest and hardest , " he said .
" it is only right that the rich countries should pay a little more . " his report is thought to be the first heavyweight contribution to the debate on climate change by an economist rather than a scientist . environmentalists hail study the study was welcomed by green groups and others . " the stern review is a wake-up call to the world , " said hans verolme , director of environmental group wwf 's global climate change program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the world is drying out the report " provides a step-change in the way we think about climate change , " said beverley darkin of the chatham house think tank in london .

" we can not hide from the issue , " he said .
" a debate on nuclear energy in europe should not be taboo . " france produces almost 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants while germany , which relies on nuclear energy for 30 percent of its needs , plans to shut all nuclear power stations by 2021 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 30.10.2006 war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski reaffirmed familiar stances during their meeting on monday germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .
but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .

" our decision to increase our order has been made after an extensive review of the recent problems at airbus , " qantas chief executive geoff dixon said in a statement . " we are convinced that these problems relate to industrialization issues at airbus and will be remedied , and in no way relate to the technical capacity of the a380 . " airbus parent , the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , announced earlier this month that production problems had forced it to delay a380 deliveries by another year on average , the third setback for the program since june 2005 . airbus has also sharply revised down its profit targets for the a380 project , saying it will now have to sell 420 planes to break even instead of 270 as previously announced .
the qantas order brings to 167 the total of a380s sold so far by airbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting the final touches on the a380 has been a giant headache for airbus " the a380 has breakthrough technology and everything we have seen reinforces our view that it is the best available aircraft for qantas , " dixon said . the a380s will be deployed on dense long-haul routes from australia to the united states , britain , europe and possibly the middle east .
the 20 airliners are due to be delivered between august 2008 and 2015 .
qantas has an option for 12 more of the superjumbo jets . the a380 has a list price of around $ 280 million -lrb- 220 million euros -rrb- and can carry 555 passengers . dixon said the terms of the new contract provided , among other things , protection against any further delay in the a380 delivery schedule . boeing , too qantas had also contracted with boeing to acquire up to 115 b787 " dreamliner " aircraft from 2008 , dixon noted , saying the new generation aircraft had " the very latest technology for aircraft in the 300-seater range . " " the boeing 787 and the airbus a380 both have up to 20 percent lower operating costs than existing aircraft and will form the nucleus of the fleets out to 2015 for qantas and our low-cost airline jetstar , " dixon said . qantas would use a combination of outright purchase and operating leases in acquiring the aircraft .

" this is about many thousands of billions of euros and environmental markets that are going to be decisive in the 21st century , " he told reporters in berlin at the presentation of the paper called " memorandum for a new deal between business , environmental and employment . " he said gas-saving cars , clean power plants and recycling technologies must be recognized as the booming markets of the future and suggested creating an " industrial cabinet , " which would provide market stimuli for innovation in the green sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants germany to invest heavily in green technology gabriel said investing in environmental technologies would result in a " double dividend , " since it would protect the environment while earning green-oriented german firms billions . germany is already one of the world leaders in green technology , which puts the country in a strong position to lead in sectors such as renewable energy , fuel and energy-saving devices and clear power plants which produce very little or no carbon dioxide emissions , which are largely responsible for climate change . " instead of hindering markets and their growth , we have to refashion them in ecological and sustainable ways , " gabriel said . consequences of climate change could be " disastrous " gabriel 's policy paper coincides with a stark warning by former world bank chief economist sir nicholas stern that the world could face economic fallout in the future on the scale of the great depression of the 1930s if it did n't invest now in green taxes or emissions trading programs . in a report released in london on monday , stern singled out the united states , china and india as economic powerhouses whose backing is crucial for a global solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir nicholas stern did n't mince his words " there is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change , if we act now and act internationally , " he said , launching his 600-page report in london .
" the task is urgent .
delaying action even by a decade or two will take us into dangerous territory . " his message was backed by british prime minister tony blair , who was at the report 's launch in central london with his finance minister and likely successor gordon brown . " should we fail to rise to this challenge , i do n't believe we will be able to explain ourselves to future generations , " said blair , warning of " disastrous " consequences for the planet unless action was taken swiftly . inaction to prove costly the stern review estimates that worldwide inaction could cost the equivalent of between five and 20 percent of global gross domestic product every year , forever . by contrast , the cost of action is equivalent to one percent of gdp , a " manageable " increase equivalent to a one-time price increase of goods of one percent , stern said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spell of dry weather and high ozone levels has damaged trees to address the situation , the economist called for carbon pricing , policies to support low-carbon technologies and more education of individuals about how they can tackle climate change . he also advocated the expansion of international frameworks on emissions trading , technology cooperation , deforestation and adaptation to climate change to develop a co-ordinated approach to climate change . brown also announced that former us vice-president al gore , who earlier this year released " an inconvenient truth , " a documentary about climate change , will become one of his personal advisors on green issues . stern warned that global warming , if left unchecked , could lead to economic upheaval on the scale of the great depression , or climate catastrophes many times worse than last year 's hurricane katrina in the us . he also suggested that rich countries should pay more than poor ones to offset their higher levels of carbon emissions . " the poor countries will be hit earliest and hardest , " he said .
" it is only right that the rich countries should pay a little more . " his report is thought to be the first heavyweight contribution to the debate on climate change by an economist rather than a scientist . environmentalists hail study the study was welcomed by green groups and others . " the stern review is a wake-up call to the world , " said hans verolme , director of environmental group wwf 's global climate change program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the world is drying out the report " provides a step-change in the way we think about climate change , " said beverley darkin of the chatham house think tank in london . " it is no longer an issue to be tackled solely by those working on environment and science issues . " eu urged to do more european commission president jose manuel barroso said on monday that the eu must step up its own fight against global warming , saying at a conference in lisbon that he would unveil proposals next year to increase energy efficiency and step up the use of renewable energies . he also urged eu governments to open up debate on the use of nuclear energy . " we can not hide from the issue , " he said .
" a debate on nuclear energy in europe should not be taboo . " france produces almost 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants while germany , which relies on nuclear energy for 30 percent of its needs , plans to shut all nuclear power stations by 2021 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 30.10.2006 war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski reaffirmed familiar stances during their meeting on monday germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .
but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .

but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .

the federal office for radiation protection must first approve the transport .
safety experts and environmentalists have expressed concerns about the plans .
they said the risks involved in transporting radioactive materials by air instead of by train , the most common means of transportation , could be higher . " we have always stood against transporting nuclear waste by air , " said heinz smital , a greenpeace nuclear expert based in hamburg .
" the consequences of an air attack or accident on a plane carrying radioactive material are unpredictable .
uranium , which has been 80 percent enriched , can be weapons grade , " he added . although the nuclear material to be transported on dec .

if such information is ever leaked to outsiders , potential terrorists could easily get their hands on radioactive materials , " said a high level national security official . the 200-kilogram load of nuclear waste was produced by a former soviet reactor in rossendorf , on the outskirts of dresden , and was shut down after german reunification in 1991 .
under a cold war agreement by the international atomic energy agency , nuclear material is supposed to be returned to its country of origin . special plane to transport uranium other experts say that a specially adapted plane for transporting uranium enriched material is safer than by train . " that way less can happen to it than on the road or on train tracks , " udo helwig , the director of the german association for nuclear technology and analysis -lrb- vkta -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . using aircraft was an economical means of transport , an environmental ministry spokesman thomas hagbeck suggested .
" considering the length of the trip , it makes sense to use air transport , " he said . since 2003 , there have been four air shipments of german nuclear waste to russia . preparations to take weeks since mainly non-reactive uranium is being sent back , the dangers from radioactivity should be minimal , according to helwig .
the waste will be brought to the dresden airport in a secure container truck , with the flight being organized by the russians themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian activists protest nuclear waste dumping preparations for flying the waste will take four weeks and would need to undergo vigorous international safety criteria .
the waste will be returned to the russian atomic reactor in podolsk , which is about 30 kilometers -lrb- around 19 miles -rrb- south of moscow , where it will be reprocessed for further use .

" this is about many thousands of billions of euros and environmental markets that are going to be decisive in the 21st century , " he told reporters in berlin at the presentation of the paper called " memorandum for a new deal between business , environmental and employment . " he said gas-saving cars , clean power plants and recycling technologies must be recognized as the booming markets of the future and suggested creating an " industrial cabinet , " which would provide market stimuli for innovation in the green sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants germany to invest heavily in green technology gabriel said investing in environmental technologies would result in a " double dividend , " since it would protect the environment while earning green-oriented german firms billions . germany is already one of the world leaders in green technology , which puts the country in a strong position to lead in sectors such as renewable energy , fuel and energy-saving devices and clear power plants which produce very little or no carbon dioxide emissions , which are largely responsible for climate change . " instead of hindering markets and their growth , we have to refashion them in ecological and sustainable ways , " gabriel said . consequences of climate change could be " disastrous " gabriel 's policy paper coincides with a stark warning by former world bank chief economist sir nicholas stern that the world could face economic fallout in the future on the scale of the great depression of the 1930s if it did n't invest now in green taxes or emissions trading programs . in a report released in london on monday , stern singled out the united states , china and india as economic powerhouses whose backing is crucial for a global solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir nicholas stern did n't mince his words " there is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change , if we act now and act internationally , " he said , launching his 600-page report in london .
" the task is urgent .
delaying action even by a decade or two will take us into dangerous territory . " his message was backed by british prime minister tony blair , who was at the report 's launch in central london with his finance minister and likely successor gordon brown . " should we fail to rise to this challenge , i do n't believe we will be able to explain ourselves to future generations , " said blair , warning of " disastrous " consequences for the planet unless action was taken swiftly . inaction to prove costly the stern review estimates that worldwide inaction could cost the equivalent of between five and 20 percent of global gross domestic product every year , forever . by contrast , the cost of action is equivalent to one percent of gdp , a " manageable " increase equivalent to a one-time price increase of goods of one percent , stern said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spell of dry weather and high ozone levels has damaged trees to address the situation , the economist called for carbon pricing , policies to support low-carbon technologies and more education of individuals about how they can tackle climate change . he also advocated the expansion of international frameworks on emissions trading , technology cooperation , deforestation and adaptation to climate change to develop a co-ordinated approach to climate change . brown also announced that former us vice-president al gore , who earlier this year released " an inconvenient truth , " a documentary about climate change , will become one of his personal advisors on green issues . stern warned that global warming , if left unchecked , could lead to economic upheaval on the scale of the great depression , or climate catastrophes many times worse than last year 's hurricane katrina in the us . he also suggested that rich countries should pay more than poor ones to offset their higher levels of carbon emissions . " the poor countries will be hit earliest and hardest , " he said .
" it is only right that the rich countries should pay a little more . " his report is thought to be the first heavyweight contribution to the debate on climate change by an economist rather than a scientist . environmentalists hail study the study was welcomed by green groups and others . " the stern review is a wake-up call to the world , " said hans verolme , director of environmental group wwf 's global climate change program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the world is drying out the report " provides a step-change in the way we think about climate change , " said beverley darkin of the chatham house think tank in london . " it is no longer an issue to be tackled solely by those working on environment and science issues . " eu urged to do more european commission president jose manuel barroso said on monday that the eu must step up its own fight against global warming , saying at a conference in lisbon that he would unveil proposals next year to increase energy efficiency and step up the use of renewable energies . he also urged eu governments to open up debate on the use of nuclear energy . " we can not hide from the issue , " he said .
" a debate on nuclear energy in europe should not be taboo . " france produces almost 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants while germany , which relies on nuclear energy for 30 percent of its needs , plans to shut all nuclear power stations by 2021 .

but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

" our decision to increase our order has been made after an extensive review of the recent problems at airbus , " qantas chief executive geoff dixon said in a statement . " we are convinced that these problems relate to industrialization issues at airbus and will be remedied , and in no way relate to the technical capacity of the a380 . " airbus parent , the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , announced earlier this month that production problems had forced it to delay a380 deliveries by another year on average , the third setback for the program since june 2005 . airbus has also sharply revised down its profit targets for the a380 project , saying it will now have to sell 420 planes to break even instead of 270 as previously announced .

" " the boeing 787 and the airbus a380 both have up to 20 percent lower operating costs than existing aircraft and will form the nucleus of the fleets out to 2015 for qantas and our low-cost airline jetstar , " dixon said . qantas would use a combination of outright purchase and operating leases in acquiring the aircraft .

" our decision to increase our order has been made after an extensive review of the recent problems at airbus , " qantas chief executive geoff dixon said in a statement . " we are convinced that these problems relate to industrialization issues at airbus and will be remedied , and in no way relate to the technical capacity of the a380 . " airbus parent , the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , announced earlier this month that production problems had forced it to delay a380 deliveries by another year on average , the third setback for the program since june 2005 . airbus has also sharply revised down its profit targets for the a380 project , saying it will now have to sell 420 planes to break even instead of 270 as previously announced .
the qantas order brings to 167 the total of a380s sold so far by airbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting the final touches on the a380 has been a giant headache for airbus " the a380 has breakthrough technology and everything we have seen reinforces our view that it is the best available aircraft for qantas , " dixon said . the a380s will be deployed on dense long-haul routes from australia to the united states , britain , europe and possibly the middle east .
the 20 airliners are due to be delivered between august 2008 and 2015 .
qantas has an option for 12 more of the superjumbo jets . the a380 has a list price of around $ 280 million -lrb- 220 million euros -rrb- and can carry 555 passengers . dixon said the terms of the new contract provided , among other things , protection against any further delay in the a380 delivery schedule . boeing , too qantas had also contracted with boeing to acquire up to 115 b787 " dreamliner " aircraft from 2008 , dixon noted , saying the new generation aircraft had " the very latest technology for aircraft in the 300-seater range . " " the boeing 787 and the airbus a380 both have up to 20 percent lower operating costs than existing aircraft and will form the nucleus of the fleets out to 2015 for qantas and our low-cost airline jetstar , " dixon said . qantas would use a combination of outright purchase and operating leases in acquiring the aircraft . " all the costs of these new aircraft will be met by operating cash flows , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 's first flight qantas had also decided to buy five more boeing 737-800 aircraft for delivery from february 2008 .
qantas this month upgraded its full year earnings guidance in a statement to the airline 's annual general meeting . " given recent improvements in our trading conditions , we now expect the current year 's results to exceed last year 's , " qantas chair margaret jackson told shareholders . qantas reported a net profit of $ 3.63 million for the year to june - a 30 percent slump over the previous year which was blamed on spiralling fuel costs . emirates audit on monday , airbus said that it was not worried by a visit by auditors from emirates airlines to check on the progress of its a380 superjumbo jets on order .
emirates is the a380 's biggest customer , having ordered 43 planes worth $ 13 billion . airbus press officer justin dubon told the associated press that it was " something agreed to at the time of christina streiff , the former ceo who was replaced on oct .
9 by louis gallois , the fourth airbus head in 16 months . "
" he promised customers that they would be kept up to date ... and briefed on the progress of the a380 . " a story on sunday on the wall street journal web site reported that dubai-based emirates was cancelling an order for 10 a340-600 jetliners .
the article quoted emirates president tim clark as saying it would not take the 10 planes , which the newspaper reported have a catalog value of $ 2.25 billion . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus wins big in china with order for 150 jets , new plant troubled airplane manufacturer airbus got some good news finally .

" our decision to increase our order has been made after an extensive review of the recent problems at airbus , " qantas chief executive geoff dixon said in a statement . " we are convinced that these problems relate to industrialization issues at airbus and will be remedied , and in no way relate to the technical capacity of the a380 . " airbus parent , the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , announced earlier this month that production problems had forced it to delay a380 deliveries by another year on average , the third setback for the program since june 2005 . airbus has also sharply revised down its profit targets for the a380 project , saying it will now have to sell 420 planes to break even instead of 270 as previously announced .
the qantas order brings to 167 the total of a380s sold so far by airbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting the final touches on the a380 has been a giant headache for airbus " the a380 has breakthrough technology and everything we have seen reinforces our view that it is the best available aircraft for qantas , " dixon said . the a380s will be deployed on dense long-haul routes from australia to the united states , britain , europe and possibly the middle east .
the 20 airliners are due to be delivered between august 2008 and 2015 .
qantas has an option for 12 more of the superjumbo jets . the a380 has a list price of around $ 280 million -lrb- 220 million euros -rrb- and can carry 555 passengers . dixon said the terms of the new contract provided , among other things , protection against any further delay in the a380 delivery schedule . boeing , too qantas had also contracted with boeing to acquire up to 115 b787 " dreamliner " aircraft from 2008 , dixon noted , saying the new generation aircraft had " the very latest technology for aircraft in the 300-seater range . " " the boeing 787 and the airbus a380 both have up to 20 percent lower operating costs than existing aircraft and will form the nucleus of the fleets out to 2015 for qantas and our low-cost airline jetstar , " dixon said . qantas would use a combination of outright purchase and operating leases in acquiring the aircraft . " all the costs of these new aircraft will be met by operating cash flows , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 's first flight qantas had also decided to buy five more boeing 737-800 aircraft for delivery from february 2008 .
qantas this month upgraded its full year earnings guidance in a statement to the airline 's annual general meeting . " given recent improvements in our trading conditions , we now expect the current year 's results to exceed last year 's , " qantas chair margaret jackson told shareholders . qantas reported a net profit of $ 3.63 million for the year to june - a 30 percent slump over the previous year which was blamed on spiralling fuel costs . emirates audit on monday , airbus said that it was not worried by a visit by auditors from emirates airlines to check on the progress of its a380 superjumbo jets on order .
emirates is the a380 's biggest customer , having ordered 43 planes worth $ 13 billion . airbus press officer justin dubon told the associated press that it was " something agreed to at the time of christina streiff , the former ceo who was replaced on oct .
9 by louis gallois , the fourth airbus head in 16 months . "
" he promised customers that they would be kept up to date ... and briefed on the progress of the a380 . " a story on sunday on the wall street journal web site reported that dubai-based emirates was cancelling an order for 10 a340-600 jetliners .
the article quoted emirates president tim clark as saying it would not take the 10 planes , which the newspaper reported have a catalog value of $ 2.25 billion . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus wins big in china with order for 150 jets , new plant troubled airplane manufacturer airbus got some good news finally .

the federal office for radiation protection must first approve the transport .
safety experts and environmentalists have expressed concerns about the plans .
they said the risks involved in transporting radioactive materials by air instead of by train , the most common means of transportation , could be higher . " we have always stood against transporting nuclear waste by air , " said heinz smital , a greenpeace nuclear expert based in hamburg .
" the consequences of an air attack or accident on a plane carrying radioactive material are unpredictable .
uranium , which has been 80 percent enriched , can be weapons grade , " he added . although the nuclear material to be transported on dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the clock is ticking eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions germany in top five countries fighting climate change germany boosts investment in climate change research interviews : the united nations and climate change environment -pipe- 30.10.2006 minister presses climate change action in wake of dire report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the consequences for the global economy are serious on the heels of a major study that says world leaders must act urgently to avert a looming environmental catastrophe , germany 's environment minister has called on the country to invest heavily in green technology . in a new strategy paper released by germany 's environment minister on monday , sigmar gabriel said new technologies in the fight against climate change and environmental pollution should become a central pillar of the german economy . " this is about many thousands of billions of euros and environmental markets that are going to be decisive in the 21st century , " he told reporters in berlin at the presentation of the paper called " memorandum for a new deal between business , environmental and employment . " he said gas-saving cars , clean power plants and recycling technologies must be recognized as the booming markets of the future and suggested creating an " industrial cabinet , " which would provide market stimuli for innovation in the green sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants germany to invest heavily in green technology gabriel said investing in environmental technologies would result in a " double dividend , " since it would protect the environment while earning green-oriented german firms billions . germany is already one of the world leaders in green technology , which puts the country in a strong position to lead in sectors such as renewable energy , fuel and energy-saving devices and clear power plants which produce very little or no carbon dioxide emissions , which are largely responsible for climate change . " instead of hindering markets and their growth , we have to refashion them in ecological and sustainable ways , " gabriel said . consequences of climate change could be " disastrous " gabriel 's policy paper coincides with a stark warning by former world bank chief economist sir nicholas stern that the world could face economic fallout in the future on the scale of the great depression of the 1930s if it did n't invest now in green taxes or emissions trading programs . in a report released in london on monday , stern singled out the united states , china and india as economic powerhouses whose backing is crucial for a global solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir nicholas stern did n't mince his words " there is still time to avoid the worst impacts of climate change , if we act now and act internationally , " he said , launching his 600-page report in london .
" the task is urgent .
delaying action even by a decade or two will take us into dangerous territory . " his message was backed by british prime minister tony blair , who was at the report 's launch in central london with his finance minister and likely successor gordon brown . " should we fail to rise to this challenge , i do n't believe we will be able to explain ourselves to future generations , " said blair , warning of " disastrous " consequences for the planet unless action was taken swiftly . inaction to prove costly the stern review estimates that worldwide inaction could cost the equivalent of between five and 20 percent of global gross domestic product every year , forever . by contrast , the cost of action is equivalent to one percent of gdp , a " manageable " increase equivalent to a one-time price increase of goods of one percent , stern said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spell of dry weather and high ozone levels has damaged trees to address the situation , the economist called for carbon pricing , policies to support low-carbon technologies and more education of individuals about how they can tackle climate change . he also advocated the expansion of international frameworks on emissions trading , technology cooperation , deforestation and adaptation to climate change to develop a co-ordinated approach to climate change . brown also announced that former us vice-president al gore , who earlier this year released " an inconvenient truth , " a documentary about climate change , will become one of his personal advisors on green issues . stern warned that global warming , if left unchecked , could lead to economic upheaval on the scale of the great depression , or climate catastrophes many times worse than last year 's hurricane katrina in the us . he also suggested that rich countries should pay more than poor ones to offset their higher levels of carbon emissions . " the poor countries will be hit earliest and hardest , " he said .
" it is only right that the rich countries should pay a little more . " his report is thought to be the first heavyweight contribution to the debate on climate change by an economist rather than a scientist . environmentalists hail study the study was welcomed by green groups and others . " the stern review is a wake-up call to the world , " said hans verolme , director of environmental group wwf 's global climate change program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the world is drying out the report " provides a step-change in the way we think about climate change , " said beverley darkin of the chatham house think tank in london . " it is no longer an issue to be tackled solely by those working on environment and science issues . " eu urged to do more european commission president jose manuel barroso said on monday that the eu must step up its own fight against global warming , saying at a conference in lisbon that he would unveil proposals next year to increase energy efficiency and step up the use of renewable energies . he also urged eu governments to open up debate on the use of nuclear energy . " we can not hide from the issue , " he said .
" a debate on nuclear energy in europe should not be taboo . " france produces almost 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear plants while germany , which relies on nuclear energy for 30 percent of its needs , plans to shut all nuclear power stations by 2021 .
however , chancellor angela merkel said last week she thought the plan was unwise . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany puts global warming prevention plan in gear german environment minister sigmar gabriel has warned of the unexpectedly fast pace of global warming and said the country needs to follow a unified plan to protect itself from increasing environment change .

" this is about many thousands of billions of euros and environmental markets that are going to be decisive in the 21st century , " he told reporters in berlin at the presentation of the paper called " memorandum for a new deal between business , environmental and employment . " he said gas-saving cars , clean power plants and recycling technologies must be recognized as the booming markets of the future and suggested creating an " industrial cabinet , " which would provide market stimuli for innovation in the green sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants germany to invest heavily in green technology gabriel said investing in environmental technologies would result in a " double dividend , " since it would protect the environment while earning green-oriented german firms billions . germany is already one of the world leaders in green technology , which puts the country in a strong position to lead in sectors such as renewable energy , fuel and energy-saving devices and clear power plants which produce very little or no carbon dioxide emissions , which are largely responsible for climate change .

" this is about many thousands of billions of euros and environmental markets that are going to be decisive in the 21st century , " he told reporters in berlin at the presentation of the paper called " memorandum for a new deal between business , environmental and employment . " he said gas-saving cars , clean power plants and recycling technologies must be recognized as the booming markets of the future and suggested creating an " industrial cabinet , " which would provide market stimuli for innovation in the green sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants germany to invest heavily in green technology gabriel said investing in environmental technologies would result in a " double dividend , " since it would protect the environment while earning green-oriented german firms billions . germany is already one of the world leaders in green technology , which puts the country in a strong position to lead in sectors such as renewable energy , fuel and energy-saving devices and clear power plants which produce very little or no carbon dioxide emissions , which are largely responsible for climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 30.10.2006 war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski reaffirmed familiar stances during their meeting on monday germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .
but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 30.10.2006 war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and kaczynski reaffirmed familiar stances during their meeting on monday germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .
but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

but when the love potion she bought from a witch did n't work , she demanded her money back .
she got it . when a lover leaves , the person left behind can sometimes resort to drastic measures .
one german woman in just such a situation did n't take the stalking route or throw herself off a cliff .
she went to a self-professed " love witch , " who she hired to use magical means to force her ex to change his mind . the heartbroken woman paid 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,270 -rrb- for a love potion , which involved a ritual carried out over several months during the full moon . however , her former lover 's heart remained cold as a stone .
the potion , it seems , fizzled . the spurned woman demanded the witch return her investment .
when the sorceress refused , her client took her to court . sounds like a no-brainer .
everyone knows the quotation falsely ascribed to p.t. barnum , " there 's a sucker born every minute . " pay up but a court in munich thought otherwise .
the judges , using all those years of rigorous legal training , ruled that a love position is an " objectively impossible service , " adding that a magic ritual is " not suitable for influencing people from a distance . " for that reason , the court ruled , the woman who hired the conjurer is entitled to her money back , never mind the jilted woman hired the witch specifically for her alleged magical prowess and entered into the commercial agreement voluntarily . one has to wonder if the ruling sets a dangerous precedent .

but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .

those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

" this is about many thousands of billions of euros and environmental markets that are going to be decisive in the 21st century , " he told reporters in berlin at the presentation of the paper called " memorandum for a new deal between business , environmental and employment . " he said gas-saving cars , clean power plants and recycling technologies must be recognized as the booming markets of the future and suggested creating an " industrial cabinet , " which would provide market stimuli for innovation in the green sector . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel wants germany to invest heavily in green technology gabriel said investing in environmental technologies would result in a " double dividend , " since it would protect the environment while earning green-oriented german firms billions . germany is already one of the world leaders in green technology , which puts the country in a strong position to lead in sectors such as renewable energy , fuel and energy-saving devices and clear power plants which produce very little or no carbon dioxide emissions , which are largely responsible for climate change .

but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's first official visit to germany was always going to be a testing affair .
relations between the two neighboring countries have been strained in the months since jaroslaw and his president twin-brother lech took control , with the kaczynski brothers accused of exploiting old grievances in the elections that brought their law and justice party to power . while new divisive topics have recently been added to the list , such as germany 's new " ostpolitik , " or eastern policy , focused on closer economic , social , cultural and trade ties with russia , poland 's leadership continues to muddy the choppy waters of german-polish relations by pursuing a grievance which has been festering for nigh on sixty years . the subject of restitution claims by ethnic germans forcibly expelled or displaced from poland at the end of world war ii came to the fore again ahead of kaczynski 's visit when the polish prime minister called for the " misunderstandings " that have brought relations between the countries to their lowest point in many years to be resolved . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's berlin visit was always going to be tense kaczynski believes that the only resolution of this problem is for germany to renounce all property and compensation claims .
during his visit to berlin monday , he also raised the possibility of a formal treaty to cement berlin 's position of non-involvement with private compensation cases and bar individuals from launching lawsuits . germany sees no need for treaty speaking after meeting with the polish prime minister , chancellor angela merkel repeated the german state 's vow never to make any claims against poland , but firmly rejected polish calls for a formal treaty .
" i am against such a treaty because it would complicate things , " she said . kaczynski countered that his government firmly believes such a treaty would help improve ties .
" we need such an additional resolution . " it is estimated that almost 660,000 germans were forced to leave poland after 1945 , leaving property and possessions behind .
around16.5 million germans were forced to flee the expanding soviet states after the war in the largest post-war migration orchestrated by the victorious western allies and the stalinist soviet union .
those who either migrated or were expelled included both true german citizens , some of whom had gained their german citizenship during nazi occupation , the people simply considered ethnic germans and those wishing to escape from communist regimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees left with what they could carry those individuals pursuing cases in the german courts claim that the expellees from poland were given less than 24 hours notice of their expulsion by the authorities to prevent them from organizing the sale of their properties or the removable of their possessions . despite the issue 's increase in prominence in the context of german-polish relations over the past year , neither government is engaged in the reparation process . no government involvement in compensation cases the german government maintains that it has no property claims on poland , that the borders between the two countries are recognized and that surviving expellees and relatives of those who have since died are pursuing compensation cases in german courts without government assistance . the current coalition government has stated that it is following the agreement made between former chancellor gerhard schröder and his polish counterpart in 2005 that promised neither government would support restitution claims pursued by individuals in either country . however , the kaczynski brothers are skeptical and have voiced concerns that the majority of expellees , who settled in southern germany , now represent a significant political lobby with close ties to chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland said the exhibition cast germans as victims their suspicions of government support for the german claims increased when the german federation of expellees opened an exhibition in berlin in august depicting the fate of the hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans forced out of poland .
prime minister kaczynski accused the exhibition of " equating the victims with the persecutors " . restitution a private not political issue but if neither government wants to pursue the restitution claims , is there really an issue at stake or is the expellee grievance just a political tool which is being exploited in poland for domestic gain ? " some polish politicians could not resist the idea to use the topic to establish nationalist support in poland , particularly in election times , " said klaus segbers , professor for political science at the institute for east european research at berlin 's free university . " now elections are over , the government has been elected , and this issue should be put to a rest . " " besides , the issue of restitution is not a major one , " professor segbers added . " it is definitely not a government issue ; german governments of different political colors have made it clear repeatedly that they do not support these kind of private demands .
it is the right of citizens to go to court and to raise the issue but in this sense it is a civil and private issue not a political one . " the view is echoed by elena klode from the east european research institute in lodz in poland .
" there is no political will to get involved in a full scale diplomatic crisis over the restitution claims , " she said . " there would be no winner if both governments decided to increase the stakes .
the arguments may go on but eventually there will be an accord with which both sides are satisfied .
there are a lot more serious topics to discuss such as the eu , international terrorism and energy . " " the private cases will go on but they continue to have no political agenda .
people want what they think they deserve .
the political relationship between germany and poland will eventually heal over this even if the claims go on . " professor segbers also believes that neither side has anything to gain from pursuing the issue of restitution .
" the whole issue should be abandoned by everyone involved .
we have had similar discussions about slavery , colonization and the like , " he said . " these things were terrible but you can not gain higher justice by digging all this up and putting a price tag onto it .
there would just be a mutual chain of claims , with no end in sight .

" our decision to increase our order has been made after an extensive review of the recent problems at airbus , " qantas chief executive geoff dixon said in a statement .

" our decision to increase our order has been made after an extensive review of the recent problems at airbus , " qantas chief executive geoff dixon said in a statement . " we are convinced that these problems relate to industrialization issues at airbus and will be remedied , and in no way relate to the technical capacity of the a380 . " airbus parent , the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- , announced earlier this month that production problems had forced it to delay a380 deliveries by another year on average , the third setback for the program since june 2005 . airbus has also sharply revised down its profit targets for the a380 project , saying it will now have to sell 420 planes to break even instead of 270 as previously announced .
the qantas order brings to 167 the total of a380s sold so far by airbus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putting the final touches on the a380 has been a giant headache for airbus " the a380 has breakthrough technology and everything we have seen reinforces our view that it is the best available aircraft for qantas , " dixon said . the a380s will be deployed on dense long-haul routes from australia to the united states , britain , europe and possibly the middle east .
the 20 airliners are due to be delivered between august 2008 and 2015 .
qantas has an option for 12 more of the superjumbo jets . the a380 has a list price of around $ 280 million -lrb- 220 million euros -rrb- and can carry 555 passengers . dixon said the terms of the new contract provided , among other things , protection against any further delay in the a380 delivery schedule . boeing , too qantas had also contracted with boeing to acquire up to 115 b787 " dreamliner " aircraft from 2008 , dixon noted , saying the new generation aircraft had " the very latest technology for aircraft in the 300-seater range . " " the boeing 787 and the airbus a380 both have up to 20 percent lower operating costs than existing aircraft and will form the nucleus of the fleets out to 2015 for qantas and our low-cost airline jetstar , " dixon said . qantas would use a combination of outright purchase and operating leases in acquiring the aircraft . " all the costs of these new aircraft will be met by operating cash flows , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 's first flight qantas had also decided to buy five more boeing 737-800 aircraft for delivery from february 2008 .
qantas this month upgraded its full year earnings guidance in a statement to the airline 's annual general meeting . " given recent improvements in our trading conditions , we now expect the current year 's results to exceed last year 's , " qantas chair margaret jackson told shareholders . qantas reported a net profit of $ 3.63 million for the year to june - a 30 percent slump over the previous year which was blamed on spiralling fuel costs . emirates audit on monday , airbus said that it was not worried by a visit by auditors from emirates airlines to check on the progress of its a380 superjumbo jets on order .

but when the love potion she bought from a witch did n't work , she demanded her money back .
she got it . when a lover leaves , the person left behind can sometimes resort to drastic measures .
one german woman in just such a situation did n't take the stalking route or throw herself off a cliff .
she went to a self-professed " love witch , " who she hired to use magical means to force her ex to change his mind . the heartbroken woman paid 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,270 -rrb- for a love potion , which involved a ritual carried out over several months during the full moon . however , her former lover 's heart remained cold as a stone .
the potion , it seems , fizzled . the spurned woman demanded the witch return her investment .
when the sorceress refused , her client took her to court . sounds like a no-brainer .
everyone knows the quotation falsely ascribed to p.t. barnum , " there 's a sucker born every minute . " pay up but a court in munich thought otherwise .
the judges , using all those years of rigorous legal training , ruled that a love position is an " objectively impossible service , " adding that a magic ritual is " not suitable for influencing people from a distance . " for that reason , the court ruled , the woman who hired the conjurer is entitled to her money back , never mind the jilted woman hired the witch specifically for her alleged magical prowess and entered into the commercial agreement voluntarily . one has to wonder if the ruling sets a dangerous precedent .
are we about to see an avalanche of lawsuits by struggling , lonely individuals against astrologers and tarot card readers who told them at one point that love and money were just around the corner ? dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : is harry heretical ?
the healing powers of homeopathy , the legitimacy of gay marriage and the sinister influence of fledgling wizard harry potter were on readers ' minds in recent weeks .
-lrb- 11.05.2005 -rrb- dw-world : a risque german fairy tale culturally speaking , the new year period is usually reserved for mainstream family entertainment .
but not this year it seems as a chilling new production of " hansel and gretel " gets set to open at a german theater .

turmeric has been used for centuries in asian medicine to treat inflammatory disorders and its extract can be found in western dietary supplements .
now lab work by university of arizona researchers , in arthritis & rheumatism , shows just how the spice 's curcuminoid extracts have a therapeutic effect .
experts say new drugs may be found , but eating more spices is unlikely to work .
the researchers said clinical trials were needed before turmeric supplements could be recommended for medicinal use .
turmeric extract earlier work by the university of arizona team showed turmeric could prevent joint inflammation in rats .
in their latest study , they set out to find exactly what ingredient in turmeric was having the anti-inflammatory effect .
they prepared extracts from the rhizome , or root of the turmeric plant , and compared them against the commercially available products that contain turmeric extracts .
results of tests in animal models of arthritis are not always reproduced in human rheumatoid arthritis .
dr ann barton , manchester university a version of turmeric extract that was free of essential oils was found to most closely match the composition of the commercial supplements .
and it was this extract , containing curcumin , that was most effective at blocking the onset of rheumatoid arthritis in the rats .
the extract appears to work by preventing a protein that controls when genes are switched on or off from being activated in the joint .
once the protein known as nf-kb is activated , it binds to genes and increases the production of inflammatory proteins , which attack the joints .
dr janet funk and her colleagues believe their findings also suggest turmeric extract could treat other inflammatory disorders , including asthma , multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease .
the extract also blocked a pathway in the body linked to bone loss , suggesting it could treat osteoporosis as well .
future work professor robert moots , professor of rheumatology at liverpool university and spokesman for the arthritis research campaign , said people with arthritis will have to wait to see if the study results in new treatments .
" it will come as no surprise if naturally occurring compounds have a drug-like effect , " he said .
" i do not think there is any evidence that countries that eat a lot of turmeric have a lower frequency of rheumatoid arthritis .
so simply eating more spices is not likely to be effective clinically .
" what is more likely is these results will lead to the targeted development of new compounds . "
dr anne barton , senior lecturer and honorary consultant rheumatologist at the university of manchester said : " the findings are interesting but should be interpreted with some caution at this stage .
" results of tests in animal models of arthritis are not always reproduced in human rheumatoid arthritis .
" as the authors point out though , there are a number of successful drug therapies that have been developed from plants . "

turmeric has been used for centuries in asian medicine to treat inflammatory disorders and its extract can be found in western dietary supplements .
now lab work by university of arizona researchers , in arthritis & rheumatism , shows just how the spice 's curcuminoid extracts have a therapeutic effect .
experts say new drugs may be found , but eating more spices is unlikely to work .
the researchers said clinical trials were needed before turmeric supplements could be recommended for medicinal use .
turmeric extract earlier work by the university of arizona team showed turmeric could prevent joint inflammation in rats .
in their latest study , they set out to find exactly what ingredient in turmeric was having the anti-inflammatory effect .
they prepared extracts from the rhizome , or root of the turmeric plant , and compared them against the commercially available products that contain turmeric extracts .
results of tests in animal models of arthritis are not always reproduced in human rheumatoid arthritis .
dr ann barton , manchester university a version of turmeric extract that was free of essential oils was found to most closely match the composition of the commercial supplements .
and it was this extract , containing curcumin , that was most effective at blocking the onset of rheumatoid arthritis in the rats .
the extract appears to work by preventing a protein that controls when genes are switched on or off from being activated in the joint .
once the protein known as nf-kb is activated , it binds to genes and increases the production of inflammatory proteins , which attack the joints .
dr janet funk and her colleagues believe their findings also suggest turmeric extract could treat other inflammatory disorders , including asthma , multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease .
the extract also blocked a pathway in the body linked to bone loss , suggesting it could treat osteoporosis as well .
future work professor robert moots , professor of rheumatology at liverpool university and spokesman for the arthritis research campaign , said people with arthritis will have to wait to see if the study results in new treatments .
" it will come as no surprise if naturally occurring compounds have a drug-like effect , " he said .
" i do not think there is any evidence that countries that eat a lot of turmeric have a lower frequency of rheumatoid arthritis .
so simply eating more spices is not likely to be effective clinically .
" what is more likely is these results will lead to the targeted development of new compounds . "
dr anne barton , senior lecturer and honorary consultant rheumatologist at the university of manchester said : " the findings are interesting but should be interpreted with some caution at this stage .

turmeric has been used for centuries in asian medicine to treat inflammatory disorders and its extract can be found in western dietary supplements .
now lab work by university of arizona researchers , in arthritis & rheumatism , shows just how the spice 's curcuminoid extracts have a therapeutic effect .
experts say new drugs may be found , but eating more spices is unlikely to work .
the researchers said clinical trials were needed before turmeric supplements could be recommended for medicinal use .
turmeric extract earlier work by the university of arizona team showed turmeric could prevent joint inflammation in rats .
in their latest study , they set out to find exactly what ingredient in turmeric was having the anti-inflammatory effect .
they prepared extracts from the rhizome , or root of the turmeric plant , and compared them against the commercially available products that contain turmeric extracts . "
results of tests in animal models of arthritis are not always reproduced in human rheumatoid arthritis . "
dr ann barton , manchester university a version of turmeric extract that was free of essential oils was found to most closely match the composition of the commercial supplements .
and it was this extract , containing curcumin , that was most effective at blocking the onset of rheumatoid arthritis in the rats .
the extract appears to work by preventing a protein that controls when genes are switched on or off from being activated in the joint .
once the protein known as nf-kb is activated , it binds to genes and increases the production of inflammatory proteins , which attack the joints .
dr janet funk and her colleagues believe their findings also suggest turmeric extract could treat other inflammatory disorders , including asthma , multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease .
the extract also blocked a pathway in the body linked to bone loss , suggesting it could treat osteoporosis as well .
future work professor robert moots , professor of rheumatology at liverpool university and spokesman for the arthritis research campaign , said people with arthritis will have to wait to see if the study results in new treatments .
" it will come as no surprise if naturally occurring compounds have a drug-like effect , " he said .
" i do not think there is any evidence that countries that eat a lot of turmeric have a lower frequency of rheumatoid arthritis .
so simply eating more spices is not likely to be effective clinically .
" what is more likely is these results will lead to the targeted development of new compounds . "
dr anne barton , senior lecturer and honorary consultant rheumatologist at the university of manchester said : " the findings are interesting but should be interpreted with some caution at this stage .
" results of tests in animal models of arthritis are not always reproduced in human rheumatoid arthritis .
" as the authors point out though , there are a number of successful drug therapies that have been developed from plants . "

it has been set up by the un to give governments , companies , organisations and individuals space for debate .
nitin desai , chair of the organising body for igf , has said the forum needed " dialogue in good faith " .
he warned that the biggest challenge in making the igf successful was a " potential culture clash " .
in a column for the bbc news website , mr desai said : " the forum will give voice to the citizens of the global net and help identify emerging issues which need to be tackled in the formal processes . " " -lsb- the forum -rsb- is about the future , the net as it will be some years from now and how we can give a voice to all who use it " nitin desai nitin desai sets out the forum 's agenda reporter 's log : athens the forum is not a decision-making body but instead is designed to give stakeholders in the internet a chance to form consensus around key areas .
more than 1,500 delegates from the around the world will be attending the meeting .
the four key agendas for the conference are security , diversity , openness and access .
emily taylor , the legal director of nominet , the uk body in charge of the .uk domain name , said the forum was important to internet users because it would be tackling issues that matter to them .
' issues ' " issues around spam , cybersecurity , openness , what are the blocks to freedom of speech ? - they speak to all internet users directly . "
" everybody has an experience of spam , sadly a lot of people have an experience of phishing attacks " emily taylor , nominet she added : " everybody has an experience of spam , sadly a lot of people have an experience of phishing attacks .
" people have got experience of viruses .
they might be aware that internationally there are different approaches to freedom of speech - not just the obvious examples of regimes cracking down on content .
" within europe there are issues around dealing with content that is perhaps not illegal but distasteful to some countries and not to others .
" these are issues that matter . "
the igf was borne out of the world summit on the information society meetings , the last of which was held in tunis .
overshadowed some felt that the aims of wsis were overshadowed by debates around the control of the internet and controversy over internationalised domain names - ie giving countries which do not use or understand the latin alphabet the ability to navigate the internet in their own script .
the move towards internationalised domain names is being overseen by icann , the body appointed by the us department of commerce to oversee domain names such as .com and .org.
tina dam , director of icann 's idn program , said the body had taken a " huge step forward " in resolving the issue .
it has recently started testing internationalised domain names with its engineers .
" people have been waiting for us to start testing for some time , " she said .
ms taylor said the forum was there to debate issues that relate to the use and misuse of internet .
' ordinary users ' " i know , from speaking to ordinary users , that these issues are much more on their minds than discussions about who manages the internet and what is exactly the role of the us government . "
mr desai said the forum was important because it gave people the chance to discuss how the internet was evolving .
" the net has outgrown its origins as a network run by and for computer specialists .
" -lsb- the forum -rsb- is about the future , the net as it will be some years from now and how we can give a voice to all who use it . "
ms taylor said : " the key thing is that anyone who is interested can take part - whether they rock up in athens or take part via blogs .
" that 's a major change of process from the past . "
have your say : what is the future of the internet ?

but what does the uk have at stake in the discussions ?
without doubt the internet is an integral part of our everyday lives .
consequently the issue of how the internet is governed is of growing interest to all sections of society .
the internet governance forum -lrb- igf -rrb- was established by the united nations at the world summit on the information society -lrb- wsis -rrb- in 2005 .
although it has no powers to make binding decisions , the igf is a multi-stakeholder forum that debates a range of issues relating to internet governance . "
the igf meeting is an opportunity to increase understanding of issues from the perspectives of different stakeholders and nationalities " emily taylor the igf represents a huge procedural step forwards because as recently as 2003 it would have been unthinkable to some that major issues on internet governance would be debated by anyone other than governments themselves .
it seems logical that something so distributed and open as the internet would benefit from a multi-stakeholder approach , and it is encouraging to see that this is beginning to happen .
high interest the first annual meeting of the igf will be held in athens from 30 october to 2 november 2006 , and it is designed to promote dialogue between all stakeholders , internet users , governments , industry and the private sector .
the igf has attracted a high level of interest with over 1,500 people registered to attend and promises to be a global gathering with representatives from the international community , business , government , and civil society preparing to take part .
the discussion will focus on four specific areas : openness , security , diversity and access .
nominet , an independent and not-for-profit internet registry services specialist , whose core business is management of .uk domain names , recently held a pre-igf event in london .
this provided a platform for uk internet community stakeholders from a range of backgrounds to consider and discuss topics from the athens agenda from a uk perspective .
a key theme that emerged from nominet 's event was that the uk can boast a number of success stories that highlight the benefits of the multi-stakeholder approach to governance .
' good citizens ' a specific example is the work of the internet watch foundation -lrb- iwf -rrb- who , by working closely with government and the internet industry has significantly reduced the number of images of child abuse held on uk servers in the past 10 years .
in 1996 the figure was 18 % , compared with less than 1 % currently .
this is one of a number of initiatives taken by " good citizens " that have not required legislation to bring them into effect .
the traditional barriers between regulators and the rest of the world are being blurred by organisations taking responsibility for their own actions , and for the welfare of the communities they serve .
the igf meeting is an opportunity to increase understanding of issues from the perspectives of different stakeholders and nationalities .
for instance , on the topic of access , uk internet users may focus on accessibility for disabled users , whilst for many overseas representatives , particularly those from developing countries , the main issue would be the costs of inter-connectivity .
anti-spam toolkit in addition to the discussions there will be a number of practical takeaways in terms of workshops : nominet is co-organising one on participation in internet governance organisations which will illustrate how the internet community can positively influence existing institutions ; and the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is running a very practical anti-spam toolkit workshop .
representatives from uk government , private sector and civil society will find the igf is a good opportunity to form " coalitions of the willing " , building common interest groups by networking and forging new relationships .
one of the major benefits is that the igf is open to all .
as nitin desai , chair of the un advisory group to the igf said at the nominet event : " the igf has no membership , it 's an open door , a town hall , all views are welcome . "

but what does the uk have at stake in the discussions ?
without doubt the internet is an integral part of our everyday lives .
consequently the issue of how the internet is governed is of growing interest to all sections of society .
the internet governance forum -lrb- igf -rrb- was established by the united nations at the world summit on the information society -lrb- wsis -rrb- in 2005 .
although it has no powers to make binding decisions , the igf is a multi-stakeholder forum that debates a range of issues relating to internet governance .
the igf meeting is an opportunity to increase understanding of issues from the perspectives of different stakeholders and nationalities emily taylor bbc net safety guide the igf represents a huge procedural step forwards because as recently as 2003 it would have been unthinkable to some that major issues on internet governance would be debated by anyone other than governments themselves .
it seems logical that something so distributed and open as the internet would benefit from a multi-stakeholder approach , and it is encouraging to see that this is beginning to happen .
high interest the first annual meeting of the igf will be held in athens from 30 october to 2 november 2006 , and it is designed to promote dialogue between all stakeholders , internet users , governments , industry and the private sector .
the igf has attracted a high level of interest with over 1,500 people registered to attend and promises to be a global gathering with representatives from the international community , business , government , and civil society preparing to take part .
the discussion will focus on four specific areas : openness , security , diversity and access .
nominet , an independent and not-for-profit internet registry services specialist , whose core business is management of .uk domain names , recently held a pre-igf event in london .
this provided a platform for uk internet community stakeholders from a range of backgrounds to consider and discuss topics from the athens agenda from a uk perspective .
a key theme that emerged from nominet 's event was that the uk can boast a number of success stories that highlight the benefits of the multi-stakeholder approach to governance .
' good citizens ' a specific example is the work of the internet watch foundation -lrb- iwf -rrb- who , by working closely with government and the internet industry has significantly reduced the number of images of child abuse held on uk servers in the past 10 years .
in 1996 the figure was 18 % , compared with less than 1 % currently .
this is one of a number of initiatives taken by " good citizens " that have not required legislation to bring them into effect .
the traditional barriers between regulators and the rest of the world are being blurred by organisations taking responsibility for their own actions , and for the welfare of the communities they serve .

but what does the uk have at stake in the discussions ?
without doubt the internet is an integral part of our everyday lives .
consequently the issue of how the internet is governed is of growing interest to all sections of society .
the internet governance forum -lrb- igf -rrb- was established by the united nations at the world summit on the information society -lrb- wsis -rrb- in 2005 .
although it has no powers to make binding decisions , the igf is a multi-stakeholder forum that debates a range of issues relating to internet governance .
the igf meeting is an opportunity to increase understanding of issues from the perspectives of different stakeholders and nationalities emily taylor bbc net safety guide the igf represents a huge procedural step forwards because as recently as 2003 it would have been unthinkable to some that major issues on internet governance would be debated by anyone other than governments themselves .
it seems logical that something so distributed and open as the internet would benefit from a multi-stakeholder approach , and it is encouraging to see that this is beginning to happen .
high interest the first annual meeting of the igf will be held in athens from 30 october to 2 november 2006 , and it is designed to promote dialogue between all stakeholders , internet users , governments , industry and the private sector .
the igf has attracted a high level of interest with over 1,500 people registered to attend and promises to be a global gathering with representatives from the international community , business , government , and civil society preparing to take part .
the discussion will focus on four specific areas : openness , security , diversity and access .
nominet , an independent and not-for-profit internet registry services specialist , whose core business is management of .uk domain names , recently held a pre-igf event in london .
this provided a platform for uk internet community stakeholders from a range of backgrounds to consider and discuss topics from the athens agenda from a uk perspective .
a key theme that emerged from nominet 's event was that the uk can boast a number of success stories that highlight the benefits of the multi-stakeholder approach to governance .
' good citizens ' a specific example is the work of the internet watch foundation -lrb- iwf -rrb- who , by working closely with government and the internet industry has significantly reduced the number of images of child abuse held on uk servers in the past 10 years .
in 1996 the figure was 18 % , compared with less than 1 % currently .
this is one of a number of initiatives taken by " good citizens " that have not required legislation to bring them into effect .
the traditional barriers between regulators and the rest of the world are being blurred by organisations taking responsibility for their own actions , and for the welfare of the communities they serve .
the igf meeting is an opportunity to increase understanding of issues from the perspectives of different stakeholders and nationalities .
for instance , on the topic of access , uk internet users may focus on accessibility for disabled users , whilst for many overseas representatives , particularly those from developing countries , the main issue would be the costs of inter-connectivity .
anti-spam toolkit in addition to the discussions there will be a number of practical takeaways in terms of workshops : nominet is co-organising one on participation in internet governance organisations which will illustrate how the internet community can positively influence existing institutions ; and the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- is running a very practical anti-spam toolkit workshop .
representatives from uk government , private sector and civil society will find the igf is a good opportunity to form " coalitions of the willing " , building common interest groups by networking and forging new relationships .
one of the major benefits is that the igf is open to all .
as nitin desai , chair of the un advisory group to the igf said at the nominet event : " the igf has no membership , it 's an open door , a town hall , all views are welcome . "
emily taylor is director of legal and policy at nominet and the only uk-based member of the advisory group to the internet governance forum .

weekend media reports said it was talking with rival partygaming , but 888 did not identify which companies it had held " preliminary discussions " .
the two firms are among the biggest victims of us law changes - effectively criminalising internet gambling .
888 said there was no certainty its talks would lead to any deals .
the sunday times had reported that partygaming and 888 would hold further talks in coming weeks about a £ 1.6bn -lrb- $ 3bn -rrb- merger .
" the board of 888 notes the recent press speculation and confirms that it has had various preliminary discussions with third parties following suspension of its us activities , " the firm said .
" there can be no certainty that these discussions will proceed to an offer being made for the company or indeed any other action . "
partygaming declined to comment on the reports .
costly decision experts have predicted there will be a round of consolidation in the sector following new moves which will make it impossible for partygaming and a clutch of other british online betting businesses to collect revenues in the us .
analysts now expect companies to switch their focus from the huge us market to concentrate more on europe and asia .
earlier this month , partygaming said its decision to exit the us market in the wake of the new legislation would cost it about $ 250m -lrb- £ 133m -rrb- .
the company had generated around 75 % of its income from the us market while around half of 888 holding 's business came from the country .
the new laws also led to a slump in the gaming sector on the london market .
partygaming shares have sunk by around 70 % and 888 by 24 % .

he told bbc wales that his " you 've got to meet them to beat them " approach had led to self-policing among fans .
" when you reach out to them , talk to them about what you 're trying to achieve you discover how positive they are , " he said .

mr hammam , who was succeeded by peter ridsdale as chairman last week , said the club had come on in " leaps and bounds " on the hooligan issue .
" they 're no longer involved , they do n't come along to games to fight , " he said .
his policy of mixing with troublemakers in an attempt to tackle the problem was greeted with criticism or scepticism from some quarters .

long-time cardiff city fan tony jeffries said the club had always had a " terrific atmosphere " , but football hooliganism had not been completely eliminated .
he said : " every football club has a problem , it 's like an itch , it never goes away . "

public health boss dr david jeffs said such measures would not have a big effect because of local affluence .
a report on the issue is to go before the states in november for debate .
' simplistic outlook ' ms hewitt urged uk chancellor gordon brown to " really increase " taxes on alcohol , especially on drinks such as alcopops , most popular with young people .
adam pharish , the island 's alcohol worker for the youth housing charity nch , agreed with dr jeffs , saying increasing tax was not the answer even to stop young people from drinking .
he said : " i think it 's a simplistic outlook on the problem .
" plenty of children are affluent because they get quite large allowances from their parents .
and , in terms of buying drink , if new taxes were brought in to stop them getting it , they would just find other ways . "
the states said its bailiwick alcohol strategy aimed to change attitudes towards alcohol by promoting sensible drinking and to reduce alcohol-related harm .

but more than 90 years later , his granddaughter was astonished to see william mcquillan 's grave pictured in a television documentary .
following up the information from the programme , marjorie wilson became the first member of her family to pay their respects at the graveside in nova scotia , almost a century later .
william mcquillan was a belfast stoker on the titanic .
one thousand five hundred people died when the belfast built ship sank after striking an iceberg in the atlantic ocean on its maiden voyage from southampton to new york in 1912 .
when the ship sank in april 1912 , mr mcquillan made it safely out of the engine room , only to die in the icy waters of the atlantic .
his body was subsequently found and taken with others to halifax , nova scotia in canada .
bbc report the bodies were then buried in individually marked graves .
william was identified by the fireman 's union membership book found in his pocket .
but back in belfast it had been reported in the local newspaper that william mcquillan was one of those who had been lost at sea .
and so his family always believed that was the end of the story .
a whole generation went to their graves believing he was one of the missing .
there was no internet or television news in those days to update news and provide critical detail .
it was october last year when the family were watching a bbc newsline documentary about titanic that the trust suddenly became clear .
during it , there was a report from alongside grave 183 , that of william mcquillan .
his granddaughter , marjorie wilson , contacted the bbc who were able to confirm the details and even provided a colour photograph of the grave .
a year later marjorie finally got to do what no family member had done before - lay flowers at the grave . "
i 'm sad and lucky , i have found my grandfather " marjorie wilson she flew to halifax .
at the graveyard , a slow walk along the 121 gravestones brought her to an abrupt halt .
in front of her was a simple granite stone " william mcquillan , died 15 april 1912 , 183 " .
laying the flowers on the stone she simply said " well , grandpa , we 've found you " .
many of the graves on the site bear no name .
this touched marjorie .
given how lucky she had been , she felt it was an opportunity that many had missed .
" it 's sad and i 'm lucky , " she explained .
" i 've found my grandfather .
but there are so many people out there who do n't know if these unmarked graves could be their relatives . "
it was an emotional moment tinged with the history of the moment .
here in a sad monument to the world 's most famous ship , a solitary woman from belfast was finally standing at the grave of a grandfather she had never met .
but for the family it was closure at last and a feeling of that history finally being laid to rest .

marjorie wilson went to nova scotia to see her grandfather 's grave but more than 90 years later , his granddaughter was astonished to see william mcquillan 's grave pictured in a television documentary .
following up the information from the programme , marjorie wilson became the first member of her family to pay their respects at the graveside in nova scotia , almost a century later .
william mcquillan was a belfast stoker on the titanic .
one thousand five hundred people died when the belfast built ship sank after striking an iceberg in the atlantic ocean on its maiden voyage from southampton to new york in 1912 .
when the ship sank in april 1912 , mr mcquillan made it safely out of the engine room , only to die in the icy waters of the atlantic .

bbc report the bodies were then buried in individually marked graves .
william was identified by the fireman 's union membership book found in his pocket .

and so his family always believed that was the end of the story .
a whole generation went to their graves believing he was one of the missing .
william mcquillan was a stoker on the titanic there was no internet or television news in those days to update news and provide critical detail .

at the graveyard , a slow walk along the 121 gravestones brought her to an abrupt halt .

laying the flowers on the stone she simply said " well , grandpa , we 've found you " .

" what we have is urban warfare , " according to patrick trotignon , a 30-year veteran working for the police union synergie .
gaelle james , an officer who works in montreuil , a poor suburb just east of paris , agrees .
" we are confronted by ever more criminals who are getting ever more violent , " she says .
" they are now out to kill cops . "
this may sound like hyperbole - but a year after a wave of rioting spread through france 's ghettos , a number of attacks in recent weeks seem to confirm this grim assessment .
on 13 october , for instance , police responding to an emergency call in epinay-sur-seine , north of paris , drove into a trap - two cars blocked their vehicle , which was set upon by dozens of youths wielding iron bars and knives .
the officers fought their way out without firing their guns , but one ended up in hospital with a broken jaw .
ms james says this kind of attack is becoming worryingly frequent - washing machines have even been dropped from tower blocks on official vehicles .
" doctors and other emergency services no longer venture into some estates , " she notes .
the increasingly organised nature of violence is highlighted in a recent report by the interior ministry 's intelligence service .
a future wave of suburban disturbances , it warns darkly , could target " the last remaining institutional representatives in a number of areas - the police " .
filming attacks according to mr trotignon , the attacks are the work of teams structured along military lines .
" operations are planned by senior commanders , with underlings making emergency calls and the foot soldiers carrying out the assaults , " he says .
what 's the point of taking risks to catch criminals when they can just walk out of court ?
gaelle james police lieutenant " and the icing on the cake is filming the whole thing with your mobile phone . "
the violence in french suburbs has devastating consequences on police morale .
" those posted there ca n't leave fast enough , " mr trotignon says .
the impoverished area of seine-saint-denis north-east of paris - where the 2005 riots began - is " haemorrhaging " officers , he adds , as those with enough seniority get transferred to the provinces .
this high turnover means that those tasked with france 's most dangerous districts tend to be young - as the prefect , the top official in seine-saint-denis , noted in a leaked note to the interior ministry .
the prefect and many in the police blame this situation on soft judges reluctant to jail the young offenders .
after last year 's disturbances , the prefect wrote , only one minor in seine-saint-denis was imprisoned out of 85 prosecuted .
" what 's the point of taking risks to catch criminals when they can just walk out of court ? "
ms james complains .
' wildlife park ' according to mr trotignon , the head of the seine-saint-denis tribunal is nicknamed " father christmas " by delinquents .
but few in the suburbs feel they are getting fair - let alone preferential - treatment from the authorities .
contempt for police , in particular , is almost universal among young men .
here is a sample of quotes from youths recently interviewed in housing estates near paris : " we do n't want a police station here .
some cops are racist . "
" riots are caused by police .
they think we are all delinquents . "
" the cops do n't respect us .
they come in and smash doors .
they systematically suspect blacks and arabs . "
" some cops are aggressive and use racial slurs when they check you . "
older residents , of course , express different views .
they deeply resent the rampant lawlessness and want more , not fewer , police .
youths from the french suburbs say they think all the ingredients for chaos remain in pictures " cars are vandalised and youths fight all the time , but when we call the cops they never come , " complains a north african man living in clichy-sous-bois , a dismal ghetto north-east of paris .
nadir dendoune , a 34-year-old journalist living in l 'ile-saint-denis , says what is needed above all is better policing .
" when i was young , the cops were patrolling on mopeds and talked to us , " he recalls .
" now they do n't know us .

" what we have is urban warfare , " according to patrick trotignon , a 30-year veteran working for the police union synergie .
gaelle james , an officer who works in montreuil , a poor suburb just east of paris , agrees .
" we are confronted by ever more criminals who are getting ever more violent , " she says .
" they are now out to kill cops . "
this may sound like hyperbole - but a year after a wave of rioting spread through france 's ghettos , a number of attacks in recent weeks seem to confirm this grim assessment .
on 13 october , for instance , police responding to an emergency call in epinay-sur-seine , north of paris , drove into a trap - two cars blocked their vehicle , which was set upon by dozens of youths wielding iron bars and knives .
the officers fought their way out without firing their guns , but one ended up in hospital with a broken jaw .
ms james says this kind of attack is becoming worryingly frequent - washing machines have even been dropped from tower blocks on official vehicles .
" doctors and other emergency services no longer venture into some estates , " she notes .
the increasingly organised nature of violence is highlighted in a recent report by the interior ministry 's intelligence service .
a future wave of suburban disturbances , it warns darkly , could target " the last remaining institutional representatives in a number of areas - the police " .
filming attacks according to mr trotignon , the attacks are the work of teams structured along military lines .
" operations are planned by senior commanders , with underlings making emergency calls and the foot soldiers carrying out the assaults , " he says .
what 's the point of taking risks to catch criminals when they can just walk out of court ?
gaelle james police lieutenant " and the icing on the cake is filming the whole thing with your mobile phone . "
the violence in french suburbs has devastating consequences on police morale .
" those posted there ca n't leave fast enough , " mr trotignon says .
the impoverished area of seine-saint-denis north-east of paris - where the 2005 riots began - is " haemorrhaging " officers , he adds , as those with enough seniority get transferred to the provinces .
this high turnover means that those tasked with france 's most dangerous districts tend to be young - as the prefect , the top official in seine-saint-denis , noted in a leaked note to the interior ministry .
the prefect and many in the police blame this situation on soft judges reluctant to jail the young offenders .
after last year 's disturbances , the prefect wrote , only one minor in seine-saint-denis was imprisoned out of 85 prosecuted .
" what 's the point of taking risks to catch criminals when they can just walk out of court ? "
ms james complains .
' wildlife park ' according to mr trotignon , the head of the seine-saint-denis tribunal is nicknamed " father christmas " by delinquents .
but few in the suburbs feel they are getting fair - let alone preferential - treatment from the authorities .
contempt for police , in particular , is almost universal among young men .
here is a sample of quotes from youths recently interviewed in housing estates near paris : " we do n't want a police station here .
some cops are racist . "
" riots are caused by police .
they think we are all delinquents . "
" the cops do n't respect us .
they come in and smash doors .
they systematically suspect blacks and arabs . "
" some cops are aggressive and use racial slurs when they check you . "
older residents , of course , express different views .
they deeply resent the rampant lawlessness and want more , not fewer , police .
youths from the french suburbs say they think all the ingredients for chaos remain in pictures " cars are vandalised and youths fight all the time , but when we call the cops they never come , " complains a north african man living in clichy-sous-bois , a dismal ghetto north-east of paris .
nadir dendoune , a 34-year-old journalist living in l 'ile-saint-denis , says what is needed above all is better policing .
" when i was young , the cops were patrolling on mopeds and talked to us , " he recalls .
" now they do n't know us .

" what we have is urban warfare , " according to patrick trotignon , a 30-year veteran working for the police union synergie .
gaelle james , an officer who works in montreuil , a poor suburb just east of paris , agrees .
" we are confronted by ever more criminals who are getting ever more violent , " she says .
" they are now out to kill cops . "
this may sound like hyperbole - but a year after a wave of rioting spread through france 's ghettos , a number of attacks in recent weeks seem to confirm this grim assessment .
on 13 october , for instance , police responding to an emergency call in epinay-sur-seine , north of paris , drove into a trap - two cars blocked their vehicle , which was set upon by dozens of youths wielding iron bars and knives .
the officers fought their way out without firing their guns , but one ended up in hospital with a broken jaw .
ms james says this kind of attack is becoming worryingly frequent - washing machines have even been dropped from tower blocks on official vehicles .
" doctors and other emergency services no longer venture into some estates , " she notes .
the increasingly organised nature of violence is highlighted in a recent report by the interior ministry 's intelligence service .
a future wave of suburban disturbances , it warns darkly , could target " the last remaining institutional representatives in a number of areas - the police " .
filming attacks according to mr trotignon , the attacks are the work of teams structured along military lines .
" operations are planned by senior commanders , with underlings making emergency calls and the foot soldiers carrying out the assaults , " he says .
what 's the point of taking risks to catch criminals when they can just walk out of court ?
gaelle james police lieutenant " and the icing on the cake is filming the whole thing with your mobile phone . "
the violence in french suburbs has devastating consequences on police morale .
" those posted there ca n't leave fast enough , " mr trotignon says .
the impoverished area of seine-saint-denis north-east of paris - where the 2005 riots began - is " haemorrhaging " officers , he adds , as those with enough seniority get transferred to the provinces .
this high turnover means that those tasked with france 's most dangerous districts tend to be young - as the prefect , the top official in seine-saint-denis , noted in a leaked note to the interior ministry .
the prefect and many in the police blame this situation on soft judges reluctant to jail the young offenders .
after last year 's disturbances , the prefect wrote , only one minor in seine-saint-denis was imprisoned out of 85 prosecuted .
" what 's the point of taking risks to catch criminals when they can just walk out of court ? "
ms james complains .
' wildlife park ' according to mr trotignon , the head of the seine-saint-denis tribunal is nicknamed " father christmas " by delinquents .
but few in the suburbs feel they are getting fair - let alone preferential - treatment from the authorities .
contempt for police , in particular , is almost universal among young men .
here is a sample of quotes from youths recently interviewed in housing estates near paris : " we do n't want a police station here .
some cops are racist . "
" riots are caused by police .
they think we are all delinquents . "
" the cops do n't respect us .
they come in and smash doors .
they systematically suspect blacks and arabs . "
" some cops are aggressive and use racial slurs when they check you . "
older residents , of course , express different views .
they deeply resent the rampant lawlessness and want more , not fewer , police .
youths from the french suburbs say they think all the ingredients for chaos remain in pictures " cars are vandalised and youths fight all the time , but when we call the cops they never come , " complains a north african man living in clichy-sous-bois , a dismal ghetto north-east of paris .
nadir dendoune , a 34-year-old journalist living in l 'ile-saint-denis , says what is needed above all is better policing .
" when i was young , the cops were patrolling on mopeds and talked to us , " he recalls .
" now they do n't know us .
they just patrol the area locked in their cars and look around as if they were in a wildlife park . "
beatings in 2002 interior minister nicolas sarkozy decided to abandon community policing based on prevention in favour of a strict law-and-order approach .
beat officers were replaced by shock " anti-crime brigades " who police the suburbs mostly from outside .
many local officials and youth workers in the suburbs feel this was a dreadful mistake .
2005 unrest in figures 9193 cars burnt 2,921 arrests 21 nights of riots source : french police " in this area community-based policing played a very positive role .
officers did real work in the estates , " says clichy 's deputy mayor , olivier klein .
" now they go in only for tough security missions , but this does not make people more secure . "
laurence ribeaucourt , a social worker in the clichy area , says the riots reveal a growing divide between police and people .
" for the past three years things have been getting steadily worse , " she says .
" youths tell me they have been beaten up in custody and harassed by police . "
whether france 's housing estates need soft " prevention " or tough repression is a matter of debate .
what is beyond dispute , however , is that the law is no longer enforced in many of france 's deprived suburbs .
relations between large sections of the population and the police have broken down .
both sides are afraid of each other and as long as the climate of fear prevails , the urban warfare will continue .

lack of cash was the predominant reason given for renting rather than owning a home , followed by a desire not to financially over-commit .
the next most common reason for shunning property ownership was people banking on house prices falling soon .
abbey interviewed more than 1,000 people and applied its findings to the uk adult population as a whole .
" there are people who feel that they do not want to get on the property ladder , but those who do face many barriers of which the most notable is the cost of homes , " said bank spokeswoman nici audham gardiner .
" however , there other more surprising results , for example , job security , lack of time and finding the right mortgage , " she added .
the research also found a substantial proportion of first-time buyers had to compromise on the home that they bought .
borrowing big meanwhile , a separate survey from the mortgage advice bureau suggested that first-time buyers might be over-reaching themselves to get onto the property ladder .
comparing the first nine months of 2006 with the same period last year , there had been a 25 % increase in people taking out 100 % mortgages .
the mortgage advice bureau said that many first-time buyers had no option but to borrow big .
but the group 's findings may raise alarm amongst housing market watchers .
taking out a 100 % mortgage leaves the borrower particularly exposed to negative equity if house prices were to fall .
uk house price inflation has far exceeded forecasts in 2006 but a widely anticipated interest rate rise in november may well force a slowdown .

before campaigning began , joseph kabila , 35 had only given two news conferences in kinshasa and has made very few speeches , despite being president for more than five years .
he became the world 's youngest head of state in january 2001 , after the assassination of his father laurent-desire kabila .
" kabila is not shy , he is reserved .
this is part of his swahili cultural background , " explains kabila 's personal secretary , kikaya bin karubi .
indeed , this reservation is in contrast to the usual congolese effusiveness .
' war bus ' joseph kabila was born in the mountains of fizi , eastern dr congo , the stronghold of his then-rebel father , but grew up in exile in tanzania .
his schoolmates at the zanaji secondary school in dar es salaam nicknamed him " war bus " because of his enjoyment of war films and martial arts .
still , they were all surprised when they saw the first pictures of him and his father fighting a real war , which ended when they seized power in dr congo -lrb- then zaire -rrb- and overthrew president mobutu sese seko in may 1997 .
" we did n't even know he was congolese , " recalls one of them , who did not want to be named .
the kabila family lived in dar es salaam under the discreet protection of then-tanzanian president julius nyerere - a man joseph kabila claims to be his " role model " .
so as not to attract the attention of mobutu 's intelligence service , they pretended they were members of the fipa people , a small ethnic group from south-west tanzania .
this upbringing and the fact that mr kabila speaks french with an english accent and knows no lingala -lrb- western dr congo 's lingua franca -rrb- has fuelled his detractors ' argument that he is in fact " a foreigner " .
in the first round of voting , he swept the board in the swahili-speaking east but was roundly defeated in the west .
parallel government the union for democracy and social progress - the opposition party of veteran opposition leader etienne tshisekedi - has spread the rumour that he is not laurent kabila 's legitimate son , but is in fact of rwandan origin - a strong accusation in a country that was invaded by the rwandan army during a five-year war . "
the congolese know exactly where their interests are .
there is a reason to hope " kabila campaign poster meeting the president with elections coming up , his closest disciples " the kabila boys " are trying hard to present their leader as genuinely congolese .
during the february political rally , they introduced his mother , sifa , and his brother and sister to the militants , while vice-president abdoullaye yerodia insisted that he witnessed mr kabila 's birth in fizi .
mr bin karubi adds that if mr kabila is not well known to the congolese , it is mainly because he spends all week working hard in the office and some of his weekends cropping and doing motocross on his farm , kingakati , on the outskirts of the capital .
indeed , in spite of the 2002 power-sharing agreement that includes four vice-presidents from rebel groups who fought during the war , and a cabinet of more than 50 ministers in his interim administration , president kabila still runs a staff of 200 , described by the opposition as a " parallel government " .
shady deals his experience as a general in the congolese army also helps him to keep direct control over a 7,000-strong army unit known as the republican guard , which allegedly includes a few zimbabwean commanders .
dr congo 's war led to shady business deals , but mr kabila has not been directly implicated in any .
the same can not be said of " the kabila boys " .
one of them , katumba mwanke , a minister at the presidency , was forced to resign because of accusations in a 2002 united nations report that he was profiteering from the war through deals made with zimbabwean officials .
yet , he remains close to the centre of power , acting as one of mr kabila 's top advisers .
on his campaign posters , mr kabila says : " the congolese know exactly where their interests are .
there is a reason to hope . "
the congolese people will be hoping that mr kabila , the clear favourite to win the presidency , also knows where the genuine interests of dr congo are , and that he will keep reminding his " boys " that they are in politics to serve the nation of 56 million .
