world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .

germany 's federal supreme court gave the federation the red card when it tried to copyright the phrases " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 . "
this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ? " one could also apply to protect christmas or easter as trade marks , " said götz jordan of the duplo confectionary company , which contested fifa 's case . despite losing this battle , it looks like fifa will win the war .
federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .
while the federation will pocket a substantial sum , it wo n't take all of the money .
some of that will be paid to the ok and projects supported by fifa . germany 's money will then go into paying off its own costs .
the german state has put 3.7 billion euros into revamping its infrastructure with 1.5 billion euros going into the modernization of all twelve host stadiums . the host nation will recoup some more cash from the tourism aspect , with some 3.5 million visitors bumping up the bank balance through hotel fees , fuel costs and value added taxes -lrb- vat -rrb- . kaiser and co. pressure fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a disguised message to fifa ?

the most prominent member of the ok has criticized the commercial behavior of fifa and has called for soccer to be " cleaned . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger has said that the marketing of soccer has reached its limits with this world cup . it appears that the criticism is starting to get through .
fifa president blatter reacted to the criticism by announcing a " self imposed restriction " after the world cup .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know . " differing degrees of aid the report said that some countries , such as spain , turkey , germany and cyprus , provided " staging posts " for rendition operations , while portugal , ireland , greece and britain were stop-off points for cia flights .
britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .

" racist attacks are a reality in germany , " the africa council , a group for expatriates , said in a statement posted on the internet in which it warned visitors to be particularly careful in the former communist east . " the likelihood of falling victim to racist attack is considerably higher in east germany and parts of east berlin than in west germany ... we therefore urge visitors to be especially careful , " the group said . it released the controversial guidelines in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany . their advice includes carrying a mobile phone whenever possible , traveling in groups if possible , and directions on how to deal with the police or to ask bystanders for help in case of attack . some members of the africa council , an umbrella group of immigrant associations , later distanced themselves from the guidelines .
these were released in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany .
heated debate the africa council has in recent weeks contributed to a heated debate about whether germany was a facing an upsurge in racism , particularly in the east of the country , and how this could effect its hard-won reputation for tolerance as it hosts the world cup . " we are satisfied with the debate we roused .
we wanted to break the silence about a racist terror of which everybody is aware but nobody wants to talk about , " the vice-president of the international league for human rights , yonas endrias , told journalists on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ermyas m. was attacked in potsdam in april , an engineer of ethiopian origin was beaten into a coma in potsdam , outside berlin , and in may a politician of turkish origin was beaten and slashed with a broken bottle in a suburb of berlin known as a neo-nazi stronghold . the government released a report a few days later which showed that the number of violent crimes attributed to the far-right had risen by 23 percent in 2005 while the premier of the state surrounding berlin conceded that right-wing racism was a problem . german chancellor angela merkel has tried to calm the waters , vowing that racist offenders will meet with the full force of the law and pleading with foreigners not to believe that germans are generally xenophobic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration after the potsdam attack , thought to be racially motivated " unfortunately we have had a few racist attacks which must absolutely be condemned , " she said last week . " but the vast majority of germans are not xenophobic . " hotline a 24-hour hotline has been set up for foreign fans who are threatened with or have been the victims of a racist attack .
the " world cup racism help line " offers advice in six languages and will be activated on thursday .
besides immediate support and assistance , hotline counselors will provide advice on dealing with german police and doctors . " we hope that we do n't get a single call , " said hot line organizer simplice freeman , who was born in cameroon .
" but we fear we 'll see multiple attacks , especially on non-white people during the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : soccer as a business world cup scores goal for german economy world cup commercialization slurs put fifa on defensive revenues rise for retailers and breweries during world cup adidas cashes in on the world cup world cup 2006 -pipe- 07.06.2006 german hosts marginalized by fifa 's occupying power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa is laughing all the way to the bank while beckenbauer and co. ponder what went wrong if there was any doubt , this is fifa 's world cup .
world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .
in 1906 , fifa had an annual turnover of 500 swiss francs -lrb- $ 411 -rrb- . court defeat a minor worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duplo stopped fifa from taking copyright too far but fifa has not had it all its own way .
germany 's federal supreme court gave the federation the red card when it tried to copyright the phrases " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 . "
this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ? " one could also apply to protect christmas or easter as trade marks , " said götz jordan of the duplo confectionary company , which contested fifa 's case . despite losing this battle , it looks like fifa will win the war .
federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .
while the federation will pocket a substantial sum , it wo n't take all of the money .
some of that will be paid to the ok and projects supported by fifa . germany 's money will then go into paying off its own costs .
the german state has put 3.7 billion euros into revamping its infrastructure with 1.5 billion euros going into the modernization of all twelve host stadiums . the host nation will recoup some more cash from the tourism aspect , with some 3.5 million visitors bumping up the bank balance through hotel fees , fuel costs and value added taxes -lrb- vat -rrb- . kaiser and co. pressure fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a disguised message to fifa ?
so is the world cup destined to become an even more bloated cash cow in future years ?
not if people like franz beckenbauer have anything to do with it .
the most prominent member of the ok has criticized the commercial behavior of fifa and has called for soccer to be " cleaned . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger has said that the marketing of soccer has reached its limits with this world cup . it appears that the criticism is starting to get through .
fifa president blatter reacted to the criticism by announcing a " self imposed restriction " after the world cup .
he announced that fifa would be looking more towards " optimum " world cups in future rather than " maximum . "
the hope is that fifa will put on more modest events after this world cup . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything " theo zwanziger is sleeping well these days .
that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism .

" racist attacks are a reality in germany , " the africa council , a group for expatriates , said in a statement posted on the internet in which it warned visitors to be particularly careful in the former communist east . " the likelihood of falling victim to racist attack is considerably higher in east germany and parts of east berlin than in west germany ... we therefore urge visitors to be especially careful , " the group said . it released the controversial guidelines in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany . their advice includes carrying a mobile phone whenever possible , traveling in groups if possible , and directions on how to deal with the police or to ask bystanders for help in case of attack . some members of the africa council , an umbrella group of immigrant associations , later distanced themselves from the guidelines .
these were released in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany .
heated debate the africa council has in recent weeks contributed to a heated debate about whether germany was a facing an upsurge in racism , particularly in the east of the country , and how this could effect its hard-won reputation for tolerance as it hosts the world cup . " we are satisfied with the debate we roused .

the " world cup racism help line " offers advice in six languages and will be activated on thursday .
besides immediate support and assistance , hotline counselors will provide advice on dealing with german police and doctors . " we hope that we do n't get a single call , " said hot line organizer simplice freeman , who was born in cameroon .

world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .
in 1906 , fifa had an annual turnover of 500 swiss francs -lrb- $ 411 -rrb- . court defeat a minor worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duplo stopped fifa from taking copyright too far but fifa has not had it all its own way .
germany 's federal supreme court gave the federation the red card when it tried to copyright the phrases " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 . "
this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ? " one could also apply to protect christmas or easter as trade marks , " said götz jordan of the duplo confectionary company , which contested fifa 's case . despite losing this battle , it looks like fifa will win the war .
federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .
while the federation will pocket a substantial sum , it wo n't take all of the money .
some of that will be paid to the ok and projects supported by fifa . germany 's money will then go into paying off its own costs .
the german state has put 3.7 billion euros into revamping its infrastructure with 1.5 billion euros going into the modernization of all twelve host stadiums . the host nation will recoup some more cash from the tourism aspect , with some 3.5 million visitors bumping up the bank balance through hotel fees , fuel costs and value added taxes -lrb- vat -rrb- . kaiser and co. pressure fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a disguised message to fifa ?
so is the world cup destined to become an even more bloated cash cow in future years ?
not if people like franz beckenbauer have anything to do with it .
the most prominent member of the ok has criticized the commercial behavior of fifa and has called for soccer to be " cleaned . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger has said that the marketing of soccer has reached its limits with this world cup . it appears that the criticism is starting to get through .
fifa president blatter reacted to the criticism by announcing a " self imposed restriction " after the world cup .
he announced that fifa would be looking more towards " optimum " world cups in future rather than " maximum . "
the hope is that fifa will put on more modest events after this world cup . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything " theo zwanziger is sleeping well these days .

police officers from 13 nations have arrived in the country to help identify and rein in potential troublemakers . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble on tuesday welcomed a group of 300 police officers from 13 countries to help german authorities boost security during the four-week tournament . " we are now very well prepared at all levels of security .
this includes germany 's municipalities , regions and the nation as a whole , but also as far as cooperation with international authorities and police is concerned , " schäuble said .
" although you can never guarantee 100 percent security , i 'm convinced people will feel safe here and enjoy a happy world cup , " he added . schäuble said the foreign police officers would be given wide-ranging powers - they will check the identification of people , ban troublemakers from stadiums and other places as well as detain violent fans . german authorities believe that the wide availability of cheap beer and the fact that germany is served by low-budget flights from all over europe make the 2006 world cup a potentially high-risk event .
they admit that , right now , they are more worried about soccer hooligans than they are about al qaeda .
german police have been busy for some time amassing intelligence from around the world to prevent known hooligans from entering the country .
new worries traditionally , trouble from hooligans has come from english , dutch and german fans .
but recent reports from poland suggest that a radical hooligan fringe is on the rise there .
authorities in germany consider it a worrying development since poland is one of germany 's neighbors and the two nations have been drawn to play each other in the first round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap beer and enthusiastic fans could prove a dangerous combination german security experts believe that the risk of violence is high for about a third of the 64 matches to be played in 12 cities .
police estimate that around 10,000 soccer fans are prone to violence . another area of concern is the more than 200 so-called public viewing sites across the country .
this is where fans without tickets can watch matches on giant video screens .
these potential flashpoints will be prime sites for the deployment of the international police officers in germany . close cooperation with britain german security authorities have been working especially closely with british police who have sent 79 officers .
they will be working with the german police at ports , airports and in trains and serve as liaison officers in the national information and cooperation center , the security headquarters for the world cup , which is based in berlin . " in england we 've been working very closely with our german government colleagues and our police colleagues for the past two years , " said steve thomas from the manchester police force and one of the cops helping out with the world cup .
" i was at the european championships 2004 and in the last four years i 've traveled europe for championship games and uefa cup games , and i can say without doubt that the level of cooperation is absolutely second to none , " thomas said .
" everything is being taken care of , everything is being planned for . "

world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .

" the likelihood of falling victim to racist attack is considerably higher in east germany and parts of east berlin than in west germany ... we therefore urge visitors to be especially careful , " the group said . it released the controversial guidelines in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany . their advice includes carrying a mobile phone whenever possible , traveling in groups if possible , and directions on how to deal with the police or to ask bystanders for help in case of attack . some members of the africa council , an umbrella group of immigrant associations , later distanced themselves from the guidelines .
these were released in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of pages of archives have been released " when one knows the hunt for eichmann was prolonged because the israelis knew that he was in argentina but did not know the alias under which he was hiding , one understands completely the importance of these documents , " naftali told afp .
" the west germans at the time had the responsibility of arresting or at least transmitting this information and it is they who are the most guilty . " an executor of the " final solution " the israelis kidnapped eichmann , one of the main executors of adolf hitler 's " final solution , " the nazi genocide of jews during world war ii , in buenos aires in 1960 .
he was brought secretly to israel , where he was tried , convicted and hung in 1962 . the cia documents reveal that the united states , at the request of west germany , successfully pressured the us magazine " life , " which had acquired the rights to publish eichmann 's memoir , to delete a reference to globke , naftali said . they also show that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer met with israeli leader david ben-gurion in ny while the german government protected a cabinet minister who was a former nazi " the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " naftali said .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . " shedding new light since 1999 a task force mandated by the us congress has been researching the national archives and documents as they are declassified to shed light on the relations between us authorities and nazi war criminals after world war ii . the group 's work also focuses on us aid given to certain leaders of the japanese regime in power during the 1930s and 1940s . some eight million pages from the cia , fbi and defense department have been studied thus far , according to the national archives .

police officers from 13 nations have arrived in the country to help identify and rein in potential troublemakers . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble on tuesday welcomed a group of 300 police officers from 13 countries to help german authorities boost security during the four-week tournament . " we are now very well prepared at all levels of security .
this includes germany 's municipalities , regions and the nation as a whole , but also as far as cooperation with international authorities and police is concerned , " schäuble said .
" although you can never guarantee 100 percent security , i 'm convinced people will feel safe here and enjoy a happy world cup , " he added . schäuble said the foreign police officers would be given wide-ranging powers - they will check the identification of people , ban troublemakers from stadiums and other places as well as detain violent fans . german authorities believe that the wide availability of cheap beer and the fact that germany is served by low-budget flights from all over europe make the 2006 world cup a potentially high-risk event .
they admit that , right now , they are more worried about soccer hooligans than they are about al qaeda .
german police have been busy for some time amassing intelligence from around the world to prevent known hooligans from entering the country .

they will be working with the german police at ports , airports and in trains and serve as liaison officers in the national information and cooperation center , the security headquarters for the world cup , which is based in berlin . " in england we 've been working very closely with our german government colleagues and our police colleagues for the past two years , " said steve thomas from the manchester police force and one of the cops helping out with the world cup .
" i was at the european championships 2004 and in the last four years i 've traveled europe for championship games and uefa cup games , and i can say without doubt that the level of cooperation is absolutely second to none , " thomas said .
" everything is being taken care of , everything is being planned for . "

" the condition for getting to the negotiating table is to suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities .
that 's the first step .

she said wednesday that reconciliation between german jews and newcomers was a priority for her tenure . " the main focus of my work as president will be to promote the integration of immigrants from the former soviet union and the fight against growing anti-semitism , right-wing extremism and xenophobia , " she told reporters . she added that jews here now saw themselves as full-fledged members of german society " even if we are still far from a normal situation . " chancellor angela merkel hailed knobloch 's " active and tireless engagement " for the jewish community in europe and said the close cooperation between the government and the council would continue . the central council of jews is the main organization representing germany 's jewish community of about 100,000 .

he later became its president . in 1951 , she married samuel knobloch , a survivor of the krakow ghetto .
she had originally wanted to emigrate to the us but changed her mind after the birth of her first child and the professional success of her husband . decades later , after her three children finished school , knobloch became active in munich 's jewish community , attacking a surge in far-right violence after national reunification in 1990 and what she called " the new anti-semitism . " in 1985 , she became president of the israeli cultural society of munich and upper bavaria .
during her tenure , she spearheaded a new complex to serve munich 's 9,000 jews .
when completed in 2007 , it will consist of a new main synagogue , a community center and a museum . knobloch has also served since 2003 as vice president for the european jewish congress and since 2005 , the world jewish congress . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's jewish community begins search for new president as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun .

police officers from 13 nations have arrived in the country to help identify and rein in potential troublemakers . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble on tuesday welcomed a group of 300 police officers from 13 countries to help german authorities boost security during the four-week tournament . " we are now very well prepared at all levels of security .
this includes germany 's municipalities , regions and the nation as a whole , but also as far as cooperation with international authorities and police is concerned , " schäuble said .
" although you can never guarantee 100 percent security , i 'm convinced people will feel safe here and enjoy a happy world cup , " he added . schäuble said the foreign police officers would be given wide-ranging powers - they will check the identification of people , ban troublemakers from stadiums and other places as well as detain violent fans . german authorities believe that the wide availability of cheap beer and the fact that germany is served by low-budget flights from all over europe make the 2006 world cup a potentially high-risk event .
they admit that , right now , they are more worried about soccer hooligans than they are about al qaeda .
german police have been busy for some time amassing intelligence from around the world to prevent known hooligans from entering the country .
new worries traditionally , trouble from hooligans has come from english , dutch and german fans .
but recent reports from poland suggest that a radical hooligan fringe is on the rise there .
authorities in germany consider it a worrying development since poland is one of germany 's neighbors and the two nations have been drawn to play each other in the first round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap beer and enthusiastic fans could prove a dangerous combination german security experts believe that the risk of violence is high for about a third of the 64 matches to be played in 12 cities .
police estimate that around 10,000 soccer fans are prone to violence . another area of concern is the more than 200 so-called public viewing sites across the country .
this is where fans without tickets can watch matches on giant video screens .
these potential flashpoints will be prime sites for the deployment of the international police officers in germany . close cooperation with britain german security authorities have been working especially closely with british police who have sent 79 officers .
they will be working with the german police at ports , airports and in trains and serve as liaison officers in the national information and cooperation center , the security headquarters for the world cup , which is based in berlin . " in england we 've been working very closely with our german government colleagues and our police colleagues for the past two years , " said steve thomas from the manchester police force and one of the cops helping out with the world cup .
" i was at the european championships 2004 and in the last four years i 've traveled europe for championship games and uefa cup games , and i can say without doubt that the level of cooperation is absolutely second to none , " thomas said .
" everything is being taken care of , everything is being planned for . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the worst-case scenario last week , for example , britain banned more than 3,000 known english hooligans from traveling to germany .
however , more than 300 of them have refused to hand in their passports to the authorities .
the british interior ministry has voiced fears that some of them may have already entered germany . nato surveillance planes take off in addition to the foreign hands helping out at the world cup , germany 's military will also be pitching in with around 7,000 soldiers .
they will be chiefly involved in possible air rescue operations and detecting radioactive materials if necessary . in addition , nato surveillance planes will monitor german airspace starting wednesday and will continue to do so until the tournament ends on july 9 . the last soccer world cup played in europe - in 1998 in france - was marred by violent hooligans who left a french policeman severely disabled . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup security , safety gets thumbs up from fifa the ninth european police congress featuring 1300 police officials from 65 countries opened in berlin tuesday with delegates focusing on security issues surrounding the world cup being held in germany this summer .

" the package , presented by european union foreign policy chief javier solana , offers a variety of incentives and fresh multilateral talks if the islamic republic agrees to suspend uranium enrichment work , which can make both reactor fuel and weapons . " there are positive steps in the proposal , and there are also some ambiguities that should be cleared up , " iran 's top national security official ali larijani said on state television . " we consider that the europeans will to solve the issue through talks is a correct step , and we welcome this , " he said after receiving the proposal and holding two hours of talks with solana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana arrived in tehran late monday " we had good discussions , " solana said , while asserting that " there is a strong consensus between the six countries " behind the package .
the offer has been drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . " now that the proposal is on the table , i hope we will receive a positive response which will be satisfactory to both sides , " he said after also meeting foreign minister manouchehr mottaki and ending his whirlwind visit to tehran . patience needed western officials have said iran - which has so far refused to freeze enrichment work - will be expected to give its response within a matter of weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani a string of tough comments from iranian officials have left many diplomats fearing that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival - but larijani asserted that it would be studied . " they submitted the proposals and the discussions were good .
we have to examine these proposals and then we will give our response , " he said . he did not elaborate on what the " ambiguities " were - but iran will undoubtedly have questions over the scope and duration of a nuclear suspension . iranian officials have signaled they may be willing to hold off on industrial-scale enrichment , but they say " research " work can not be halted . while being offered carrots , iran also faces the stick of robust security council action - including a range of possible sanctions - if it rejects the offer and continues what the west fears is a covert weapons drive . " i would counsel patience , " white house spokesman tony snow told reporters in washington on monday . " at this point , as we 've said all along , let 's give it time .
let 's let the iranians take a look at what the offers are , at the incentives and disincentives . " " there is hope " although the united states has not ruled out taking military action , diplomats say it has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if iran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington , whose ties with tehran were severed more than two decades ago , has banned most us trade and investment in the islamic republic since the mid-1990s . " the condition for getting to the negotiating table is to suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities .
that 's the first step .
should that happen , then the whole series of other things can take place , " snow said . " there 's neither optimism nor pessimism ; there is hope . " iran maintains defiant stance on saturday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that he had been asked by un secretary general kofi annan " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " but the president has consistently ruled out halting enrichment : " they say that they want to give us incentives .
they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange , " he said last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei also vowed sunday that his country would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes " and spoke of iran 's " scientific progress " as " representative of our political independence and national self-confidence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : soccer as a business world cup scores goal for german economy world cup commercialization slurs put fifa on defensive revenues rise for retailers and breweries during world cup adidas cashes in on the world cup world cup 2006 -pipe- 07.06.2006 german hosts marginalized by fifa 's occupying power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa is laughing all the way to the bank while beckenbauer and co. ponder what went wrong if there was any doubt , this is fifa 's world cup .
world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .
in 1906 , fifa had an annual turnover of 500 swiss francs -lrb- $ 411 -rrb- . court defeat a minor worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duplo stopped fifa from taking copyright too far but fifa has not had it all its own way .
germany 's federal supreme court gave the federation the red card when it tried to copyright the phrases " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 . "
this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ? " one could also apply to protect christmas or easter as trade marks , " said götz jordan of the duplo confectionary company , which contested fifa 's case . despite losing this battle , it looks like fifa will win the war .
federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .
while the federation will pocket a substantial sum , it wo n't take all of the money .
some of that will be paid to the ok and projects supported by fifa . germany 's money will then go into paying off its own costs .
the german state has put 3.7 billion euros into revamping its infrastructure with 1.5 billion euros going into the modernization of all twelve host stadiums . the host nation will recoup some more cash from the tourism aspect , with some 3.5 million visitors bumping up the bank balance through hotel fees , fuel costs and value added taxes -lrb- vat -rrb- . kaiser and co. pressure fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a disguised message to fifa ?
so is the world cup destined to become an even more bloated cash cow in future years ?
not if people like franz beckenbauer have anything to do with it .
the most prominent member of the ok has criticized the commercial behavior of fifa and has called for soccer to be " cleaned . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger has said that the marketing of soccer has reached its limits with this world cup . it appears that the criticism is starting to get through .
fifa president blatter reacted to the criticism by announcing a " self imposed restriction " after the world cup .
he announced that fifa would be looking more towards " optimum " world cups in future rather than " maximum . "
the hope is that fifa will put on more modest events after this world cup . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything " theo zwanziger is sleeping well these days .
that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny .

she replaces paul spiegel , who ran the council since 2000 and who died of cancer in april at 68 . knobloch , who has served as council vice president since 1996 , was considered a shoo-in for the job .
she said wednesday that reconciliation between german jews and newcomers was a priority for her tenure . " the main focus of my work as president will be to promote the integration of immigrants from the former soviet union and the fight against growing anti-semitism , right-wing extremism and xenophobia , " she told reporters . she added that jews here now saw themselves as full-fledged members of german society " even if we are still far from a normal situation . " chancellor angela merkel hailed knobloch 's " active and tireless engagement " for the jewish community in europe and said the close cooperation between the government and the council would continue . the central council of jews is the main organization representing germany 's jewish community of about 100,000 .
on wednesday , dieter graumann , a 54-year-old financial expert from frankfurt , was elected vice-president to replace knobloch .
salomon korn , a 62-year-old architect , keeps his office as the council 's other vice-president and head of the jewish community in frankfurt .

her father was fritz neuland , a prominent attorney and state senator .
during the war , knobloch was hidden by a young catholic woman on a farm in northern bavaria and passed off as her illegitimate daughter .
her grandmother was killed in auschwitz and her father survived the war as a slave laborer .
they were reunited when she found him at a munich hospital . neuland became one of the founding members of munich 's vestigial jewish community in july 1945 , just two months after the war 's end .
he later became its president . in 1951 , she married samuel knobloch , a survivor of the krakow ghetto .
she had originally wanted to emigrate to the us but changed her mind after the birth of her first child and the professional success of her husband . decades later , after her three children finished school , knobloch became active in munich 's jewish community , attacking a surge in far-right violence after national reunification in 1990 and what she called " the new anti-semitism . " in 1985 , she became president of the israeli cultural society of munich and upper bavaria .
during her tenure , she spearheaded a new complex to serve munich 's 9,000 jews .
when completed in 2007 , it will consist of a new main synagogue , a community center and a museum . knobloch has also served since 2003 as vice president for the european jewish congress and since 2005 , the world jewish congress . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's jewish community begins search for new president as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of pages of archives have been released " when one knows the hunt for eichmann was prolonged because the israelis knew that he was in argentina but did not know the alias under which he was hiding , one understands completely the importance of these documents , " naftali told afp .
" the west germans at the time had the responsibility of arresting or at least transmitting this information and it is they who are the most guilty . " an executor of the " final solution " the israelis kidnapped eichmann , one of the main executors of adolf hitler 's " final solution , " the nazi genocide of jews during world war ii , in buenos aires in 1960 .
he was brought secretly to israel , where he was tried , convicted and hung in 1962 . the cia documents reveal that the united states , at the request of west germany , successfully pressured the us magazine " life , " which had acquired the rights to publish eichmann 's memoir , to delete a reference to globke , naftali said . they also show that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer met with israeli leader david ben-gurion in ny while the german government protected a cabinet minister who was a former nazi " the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " naftali said .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . " shedding new light since 1999 a task force mandated by the us congress has been researching the national archives and documents as they are declassified to shed light on the relations between us authorities and nazi war criminals after world war ii . the group 's work also focuses on us aid given to certain leaders of the japanese regime in power during the 1930s and 1940s . some eight million pages from the cia , fbi and defense department have been studied thus far , according to the national archives .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of pages of archives have been released " when one knows the hunt for eichmann was prolonged because the israelis knew that he was in argentina but did not know the alias under which he was hiding , one understands completely the importance of these documents , " naftali told afp .
" the west germans at the time had the responsibility of arresting or at least transmitting this information and it is they who are the most guilty . " an executor of the " final solution " the israelis kidnapped eichmann , one of the main executors of adolf hitler 's " final solution , " the nazi genocide of jews during world war ii , in buenos aires in 1960 .
he was brought secretly to israel , where he was tried , convicted and hung in 1962 . the cia documents reveal that the united states , at the request of west germany , successfully pressured the us magazine " life , " which had acquired the rights to publish eichmann 's memoir , to delete a reference to globke , naftali said . they also show that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .

" the package , presented by european union foreign policy chief javier solana , offers a variety of incentives and fresh multilateral talks if the islamic republic agrees to suspend uranium enrichment work , which can make both reactor fuel and weapons . " there are positive steps in the proposal , and there are also some ambiguities that should be cleared up , " iran 's top national security official ali larijani said on state television .

the offer has been drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . " now that the proposal is on the table , i hope we will receive a positive response which will be satisfactory to both sides , " he said after also meeting foreign minister manouchehr mottaki and ending his whirlwind visit to tehran . patience needed western officials have said iran - which has so far refused to freeze enrichment work - will be expected to give its response within a matter of weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani a string of tough comments from iranian officials have left many diplomats fearing that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival - but larijani asserted that it would be studied .

we have to examine these proposals and then we will give our response , " he said . he did not elaborate on what the " ambiguities " were - but iran will undoubtedly have questions over the scope and duration of a nuclear suspension . iranian officials have signaled they may be willing to hold off on industrial-scale enrichment , but they say " research " work can not be halted . while being offered carrots , iran also faces the stick of robust security council action - including a range of possible sanctions - if it rejects the offer and continues what the west fears is a covert weapons drive . " i would counsel patience , " white house spokesman tony snow told reporters in washington on monday . " at this point , as we 've said all along , let 's give it time .
let 's let the iranians take a look at what the offers are , at the incentives and disincentives . " " there is hope " although the united states has not ruled out taking military action , diplomats say it has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if iran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington , whose ties with tehran were severed more than two decades ago , has banned most us trade and investment in the islamic republic since the mid-1990s . " the condition for getting to the negotiating table is to suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities .
that 's the first step .
should that happen , then the whole series of other things can take place , " snow said . " there 's neither optimism nor pessimism ; there is hope . " iran maintains defiant stance on saturday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that he had been asked by un secretary general kofi annan " to examine the proposals and not act hastily .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : soccer as a business world cup scores goal for german economy world cup commercialization slurs put fifa on defensive revenues rise for retailers and breweries during world cup adidas cashes in on the world cup world cup 2006 -pipe- 07.06.2006 german hosts marginalized by fifa 's occupying power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifa is laughing all the way to the bank while beckenbauer and co. ponder what went wrong if there was any doubt , this is fifa 's world cup .
world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .
in 1906 , fifa had an annual turnover of 500 swiss francs -lrb- $ 411 -rrb- . court defeat a minor worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duplo stopped fifa from taking copyright too far but fifa has not had it all its own way .
germany 's federal supreme court gave the federation the red card when it tried to copyright the phrases " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 . "
this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ? " one could also apply to protect christmas or easter as trade marks , " said götz jordan of the duplo confectionary company , which contested fifa 's case . despite losing this battle , it looks like fifa will win the war .
federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .
while the federation will pocket a substantial sum , it wo n't take all of the money .
some of that will be paid to the ok and projects supported by fifa . germany 's money will then go into paying off its own costs .
the german state has put 3.7 billion euros into revamping its infrastructure with 1.5 billion euros going into the modernization of all twelve host stadiums . the host nation will recoup some more cash from the tourism aspect , with some 3.5 million visitors bumping up the bank balance through hotel fees , fuel costs and value added taxes -lrb- vat -rrb- . kaiser and co. pressure fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a disguised message to fifa ?
so is the world cup destined to become an even more bloated cash cow in future years ?
not if people like franz beckenbauer have anything to do with it .
the most prominent member of the ok has criticized the commercial behavior of fifa and has called for soccer to be " cleaned . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger has said that the marketing of soccer has reached its limits with this world cup . it appears that the criticism is starting to get through .
fifa president blatter reacted to the criticism by announcing a " self imposed restriction " after the world cup .
he announced that fifa would be looking more towards " optimum " world cups in future rather than " maximum . "
the hope is that fifa will put on more modest events after this world cup . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything " theo zwanziger is sleeping well these days .
that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny .
-lrb- june 4 , 2006 -rrb- businesses and events at mercy of fifa 's trademark control pop quiz : what is the name of the global soccer tournament taking place in germany this summer ?
answer : the fifa world cup .
you can say it ... but you ca n't wear it .
not without a license anyway .
-lrb- march 30 , 2006 -rrb- world cup commercialization slurs put fifa on defensive less than a week before the world cup starts , sepp blatter , the head of soccer 's world governing body fifa , has had to fight off accusations that the tournament will be ruined by big business .

" although you can never guarantee 100 percent security , i 'm convinced people will feel safe here and enjoy a happy world cup , " he added . schäuble said the foreign police officers would be given wide-ranging powers - they will check the identification of people , ban troublemakers from stadiums and other places as well as detain violent fans . german authorities believe that the wide availability of cheap beer and the fact that germany is served by low-budget flights from all over europe make the 2006 world cup a potentially high-risk event .

" although you can never guarantee 100 percent security , i 'm convinced people will feel safe here and enjoy a happy world cup , " he added . schäuble said the foreign police officers would be given wide-ranging powers - they will check the identification of people , ban troublemakers from stadiums and other places as well as detain violent fans . german authorities believe that the wide availability of cheap beer and the fact that germany is served by low-budget flights from all over europe make the 2006 world cup a potentially high-risk event .
they admit that , right now , they are more worried about soccer hooligans than they are about al qaeda .
german police have been busy for some time amassing intelligence from around the world to prevent known hooligans from entering the country .
new worries traditionally , trouble from hooligans has come from english , dutch and german fans .
but recent reports from poland suggest that a radical hooligan fringe is on the rise there .
authorities in germany consider it a worrying development since poland is one of germany 's neighbors and the two nations have been drawn to play each other in the first round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap beer and enthusiastic fans could prove a dangerous combination german security experts believe that the risk of violence is high for about a third of the 64 matches to be played in 12 cities .
police estimate that around 10,000 soccer fans are prone to violence . another area of concern is the more than 200 so-called public viewing sites across the country .
this is where fans without tickets can watch matches on giant video screens .
these potential flashpoints will be prime sites for the deployment of the international police officers in germany . close cooperation with britain german security authorities have been working especially closely with british police who have sent 79 officers .
they will be working with the german police at ports , airports and in trains and serve as liaison officers in the national information and cooperation center , the security headquarters for the world cup , which is based in berlin . " in england we 've been working very closely with our german government colleagues and our police colleagues for the past two years , " said steve thomas from the manchester police force and one of the cops helping out with the world cup .
" i was at the european championships 2004 and in the last four years i 've traveled europe for championship games and uefa cup games , and i can say without doubt that the level of cooperation is absolutely second to none , " thomas said .
" everything is being taken care of , everything is being planned for . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the worst-case scenario last week , for example , britain banned more than 3,000 known english hooligans from traveling to germany .
however , more than 300 of them have refused to hand in their passports to the authorities .
the british interior ministry has voiced fears that some of them may have already entered germany . nato surveillance planes take off in addition to the foreign hands helping out at the world cup , germany 's military will also be pitching in with around 7,000 soldiers .
they will be chiefly involved in possible air rescue operations and detecting radioactive materials if necessary . in addition , nato surveillance planes will monitor german airspace starting wednesday and will continue to do so until the tournament ends on july 9 . the last soccer world cup played in europe - in 1998 in france - was marred by violent hooligans who left a french policeman severely disabled . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup security , safety gets thumbs up from fifa the ninth european police congress featuring 1300 police officials from 65 countries opened in berlin tuesday with delegates focusing on security issues surrounding the world cup being held in germany this summer .

others passed on information about their citizens .

both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .

britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .
macedonia was accused of covering up its involvement in the rendition of a german national , khaled el-masri , to afghanistan in january 2004 .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know . " differing degrees of aid the report said that some countries , such as spain , turkey , germany and cyprus , provided " staging posts " for rendition operations , while portugal , ireland , greece and britain were stop-off points for cia flights .
britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .
macedonia was accused of covering up its involvement in the rendition of a german national , khaled el-masri , to afghanistan in january 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri 's account of his alleged abduction matches flight data but marty 's most serious charges were said to be against poland and romania , where there was now reportedly enough concrete evidence to support suspicions that the governments there allowed cia secret prisons on their soil . focus on poland marty 's evidence was based on flight plans filed with european air traffic controllers .
thousands of pages of data by eurocontrol , the air traffic agency , showed a " clear pattern " of " rendition circuits , " or specific missions for the transfer of prisoners .
trips were logged not only to romania but from afghanistan to poland .
and some matched accounts by prisoners of their abductions . the report details the cases of 18 terror suspects who were moved around europe .
and in a few cases , flights flew into romania and poland from kabul in what marty wrote could only be drop-off points for prisoners . in the case of poland , eurocontrol detailed a series of flights into szmany air base near warsaw .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know . " differing degrees of aid the report said that some countries , such as spain , turkey , germany and cyprus , provided " staging posts " for rendition operations , while portugal , ireland , greece and britain were stop-off points for cia flights .
britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .
macedonia was accused of covering up its involvement in the rendition of a german national , khaled el-masri , to afghanistan in january 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri 's account of his alleged abduction matches flight data but marty 's most serious charges were said to be against poland and romania , where there was now reportedly enough concrete evidence to support suspicions that the governments there allowed cia secret prisons on their soil . focus on poland marty 's evidence was based on flight plans filed with european air traffic controllers .
thousands of pages of data by eurocontrol , the air traffic agency , showed a " clear pattern " of " rendition circuits , " or specific missions for the transfer of prisoners .
trips were logged not only to romania but from afghanistan to poland .
and some matched accounts by prisoners of their abductions . the report details the cases of 18 terror suspects who were moved around europe .
and in a few cases , flights flew into romania and poland from kabul in what marty wrote could only be drop-off points for prisoners . in the case of poland , eurocontrol detailed a series of flights into szmany air base near warsaw .
marty has accused poland of failing to cooperate ; polish officials have said they have no record of the visit .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know .

this includes germany 's municipalities , regions and the nation as a whole , but also as far as cooperation with international authorities and police is concerned , " schäuble said .
" although you can never guarantee 100 percent security , i 'm convinced people will feel safe here and enjoy a happy world cup , " he added . schäuble said the foreign police officers would be given wide-ranging powers - they will check the identification of people , ban troublemakers from stadiums and other places as well as detain violent fans . german authorities believe that the wide availability of cheap beer and the fact that germany is served by low-budget flights from all over europe make the 2006 world cup a potentially high-risk event .

" i was at the european championships 2004 and in the last four years i 've traveled europe for championship games and uefa cup games , and i can say without doubt that the level of cooperation is absolutely second to none , " thomas said .

" now that the proposal is on the table , i hope we will receive a positive response which will be satisfactory to both sides , " he said after also meeting foreign minister manouchehr mottaki and ending his whirlwind visit to tehran . patience needed western officials have said iran - which has so far refused to freeze enrichment work - will be expected to give its response within a matter of weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani a string of tough comments from iranian officials have left many diplomats fearing that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival - but larijani asserted that it would be studied .

" racist attacks are a reality in germany , " the africa council , a group for expatriates , said in a statement posted on the internet in which it warned visitors to be particularly careful in the former communist east . " the likelihood of falling victim to racist attack is considerably higher in east germany and parts of east berlin than in west germany ... we therefore urge visitors to be especially careful , " the group said . it released the controversial guidelines in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany . their advice includes carrying a mobile phone whenever possible , traveling in groups if possible , and directions on how to deal with the police or to ask bystanders for help in case of attack . some members of the africa council , an umbrella group of immigrant associations , later distanced themselves from the guidelines .

world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .
in 1906 , fifa had an annual turnover of 500 swiss francs -lrb- $ 411 -rrb- . court defeat a minor worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duplo stopped fifa from taking copyright too far but fifa has not had it all its own way .
germany 's federal supreme court gave the federation the red card when it tried to copyright the phrases " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 . "
this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ? " one could also apply to protect christmas or easter as trade marks , " said götz jordan of the duplo confectionary company , which contested fifa 's case . despite losing this battle , it looks like fifa will win the war .
federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .
while the federation will pocket a substantial sum , it wo n't take all of the money .
some of that will be paid to the ok and projects supported by fifa . germany 's money will then go into paying off its own costs .
the german state has put 3.7 billion euros into revamping its infrastructure with 1.5 billion euros going into the modernization of all twelve host stadiums . the host nation will recoup some more cash from the tourism aspect , with some 3.5 million visitors bumping up the bank balance through hotel fees , fuel costs and value added taxes -lrb- vat -rrb- . kaiser and co. pressure fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a disguised message to fifa ?
so is the world cup destined to become an even more bloated cash cow in future years ?
not if people like franz beckenbauer have anything to do with it .
the most prominent member of the ok has criticized the commercial behavior of fifa and has called for soccer to be " cleaned . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger has said that the marketing of soccer has reached its limits with this world cup . it appears that the criticism is starting to get through .
fifa president blatter reacted to the criticism by announcing a " self imposed restriction " after the world cup .
he announced that fifa would be looking more towards " optimum " world cups in future rather than " maximum . "
the hope is that fifa will put on more modest events after this world cup . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything " theo zwanziger is sleeping well these days .

when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .

germany 's federal supreme court gave the federation the red card when it tried to copyright the phrases " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 . "
this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ?

federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .

world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .

world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .
in 1906 , fifa had an annual turnover of 500 swiss francs -lrb- $ 411 -rrb- . court defeat a minor worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duplo stopped fifa from taking copyright too far but fifa has not had it all its own way .
germany 's federal supreme court gave the federation the red card when it tried to copyright the phrases " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 . "
this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ? " one could also apply to protect christmas or easter as trade marks , " said götz jordan of the duplo confectionary company , which contested fifa 's case . despite losing this battle , it looks like fifa will win the war .
federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .
while the federation will pocket a substantial sum , it wo n't take all of the money .
some of that will be paid to the ok and projects supported by fifa . germany 's money will then go into paying off its own costs .
the german state has put 3.7 billion euros into revamping its infrastructure with 1.5 billion euros going into the modernization of all twelve host stadiums . the host nation will recoup some more cash from the tourism aspect , with some 3.5 million visitors bumping up the bank balance through hotel fees , fuel costs and value added taxes -lrb- vat -rrb- . kaiser and co. pressure fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a disguised message to fifa ?
so is the world cup destined to become an even more bloated cash cow in future years ?
not if people like franz beckenbauer have anything to do with it .
the most prominent member of the ok has criticized the commercial behavior of fifa and has called for soccer to be " cleaned . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger has said that the marketing of soccer has reached its limits with this world cup . it appears that the criticism is starting to get through .
fifa president blatter reacted to the criticism by announcing a " self imposed restriction " after the world cup .
he announced that fifa would be looking more towards " optimum " world cups in future rather than " maximum . "
the hope is that fifa will put on more modest events after this world cup . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything " theo zwanziger is sleeping well these days .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of pages of archives have been released " when one knows the hunt for eichmann was prolonged because the israelis knew that he was in argentina but did not know the alias under which he was hiding , one understands completely the importance of these documents , " naftali told afp .
" the west germans at the time had the responsibility of arresting or at least transmitting this information and it is they who are the most guilty . " an executor of the " final solution " the israelis kidnapped eichmann , one of the main executors of adolf hitler 's " final solution , " the nazi genocide of jews during world war ii , in buenos aires in 1960 .
he was brought secretly to israel , where he was tried , convicted and hung in 1962 . the cia documents reveal that the united states , at the request of west germany , successfully pressured the us magazine " life , " which had acquired the rights to publish eichmann 's memoir , to delete a reference to globke , naftali said . they also show that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer met with israeli leader david ben-gurion in ny while the german government protected a cabinet minister who was a former nazi " the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " naftali said .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . " shedding new light since 1999 a task force mandated by the us congress has been researching the national archives and documents as they are declassified to shed light on the relations between us authorities and nazi war criminals after world war ii . the group 's work also focuses on us aid given to certain leaders of the japanese regime in power during the 1930s and 1940s . some eight million pages from the cia , fbi and defense department have been studied thus far , according to the national archives .

she replaces paul spiegel , who ran the council since 2000 and who died of cancer in april at 68 . knobloch , who has served as council vice president since 1996 , was considered a shoo-in for the job .
she said wednesday that reconciliation between german jews and newcomers was a priority for her tenure . " the main focus of my work as president will be to promote the integration of immigrants from the former soviet union and the fight against growing anti-semitism , right-wing extremism and xenophobia , " she told reporters . she added that jews here now saw themselves as full-fledged members of german society " even if we are still far from a normal situation . " chancellor angela merkel hailed knobloch 's " active and tireless engagement " for the jewish community in europe and said the close cooperation between the government and the council would continue . the central council of jews is the main organization representing germany 's jewish community of about 100,000 .
on wednesday , dieter graumann , a 54-year-old financial expert from frankfurt , was elected vice-president to replace knobloch .
salomon korn , a 62-year-old architect , keeps his office as the council 's other vice-president and head of the jewish community in frankfurt .

her grandmother was killed in auschwitz and her father survived the war as a slave laborer .
they were reunited when she found him at a munich hospital . neuland became one of the founding members of munich 's vestigial jewish community in july 1945 , just two months after the war 's end .
he later became its president . in 1951 , she married samuel knobloch , a survivor of the krakow ghetto .
she had originally wanted to emigrate to the us but changed her mind after the birth of her first child and the professional success of her husband . decades later , after her three children finished school , knobloch became active in munich 's jewish community , attacking a surge in far-right violence after national reunification in 1990 and what she called " the new anti-semitism . " in 1985 , she became president of the israeli cultural society of munich and upper bavaria .
during her tenure , she spearheaded a new complex to serve munich 's 9,000 jews .
when completed in 2007 , it will consist of a new main synagogue , a community center and a museum . knobloch has also served since 2003 as vice president for the european jewish congress and since 2005 , the world jewish congress . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's jewish community begins search for new president as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun .

" racist attacks are a reality in germany , " the africa council , a group for expatriates , said in a statement posted on the internet in which it warned visitors to be particularly careful in the former communist east . " the likelihood of falling victim to racist attack is considerably higher in east germany and parts of east berlin than in west germany ... we therefore urge visitors to be especially careful , " the group said . it released the controversial guidelines in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany . their advice includes carrying a mobile phone whenever possible , traveling in groups if possible , and directions on how to deal with the police or to ask bystanders for help in case of attack . some members of the africa council , an umbrella group of immigrant associations , later distanced themselves from the guidelines .
these were released in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany .
heated debate the africa council has in recent weeks contributed to a heated debate about whether germany was a facing an upsurge in racism , particularly in the east of the country , and how this could effect its hard-won reputation for tolerance as it hosts the world cup .

the " world cup racism help line " offers advice in six languages and will be activated on thursday .
besides immediate support and assistance , hotline counselors will provide advice on dealing with german police and doctors . " we hope that we do n't get a single call , " said hot line organizer simplice freeman , who was born in cameroon .

world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .
in 1906 , fifa had an annual turnover of 500 swiss francs -lrb- $ 411 -rrb- . court defeat a minor worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duplo stopped fifa from taking copyright too far but fifa has not had it all its own way .
germany 's federal supreme court gave the federation the red card when it tried to copyright the phrases " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 . "
this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ? " one could also apply to protect christmas or easter as trade marks , " said götz jordan of the duplo confectionary company , which contested fifa 's case . despite losing this battle , it looks like fifa will win the war .
federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .
while the federation will pocket a substantial sum , it wo n't take all of the money .
some of that will be paid to the ok and projects supported by fifa . germany 's money will then go into paying off its own costs .
the german state has put 3.7 billion euros into revamping its infrastructure with 1.5 billion euros going into the modernization of all twelve host stadiums . the host nation will recoup some more cash from the tourism aspect , with some 3.5 million visitors bumping up the bank balance through hotel fees , fuel costs and value added taxes -lrb- vat -rrb- . kaiser and co. pressure fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a disguised message to fifa ?
so is the world cup destined to become an even more bloated cash cow in future years ?
not if people like franz beckenbauer have anything to do with it .
the most prominent member of the ok has criticized the commercial behavior of fifa and has called for soccer to be " cleaned . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger has said that the marketing of soccer has reached its limits with this world cup . it appears that the criticism is starting to get through .
fifa president blatter reacted to the criticism by announcing a " self imposed restriction " after the world cup .
he announced that fifa would be looking more towards " optimum " world cups in future rather than " maximum . "
the hope is that fifa will put on more modest events after this world cup . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything " theo zwanziger is sleeping well these days .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of pages of archives have been released " when one knows the hunt for eichmann was prolonged because the israelis knew that he was in argentina but did not know the alias under which he was hiding , one understands completely the importance of these documents , " naftali told afp .
" the west germans at the time had the responsibility of arresting or at least transmitting this information and it is they who are the most guilty . " an executor of the " final solution " the israelis kidnapped eichmann , one of the main executors of adolf hitler 's " final solution , " the nazi genocide of jews during world war ii , in buenos aires in 1960 .
he was brought secretly to israel , where he was tried , convicted and hung in 1962 . the cia documents reveal that the united states , at the request of west germany , successfully pressured the us magazine " life , " which had acquired the rights to publish eichmann 's memoir , to delete a reference to globke , naftali said . they also show that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer met with israeli leader david ben-gurion in ny while the german government protected a cabinet minister who was a former nazi " the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " naftali said .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . " shedding new light since 1999 a task force mandated by the us congress has been researching the national archives and documents as they are declassified to shed light on the relations between us authorities and nazi war criminals after world war ii . the group 's work also focuses on us aid given to certain leaders of the japanese regime in power during the 1930s and 1940s . some eight million pages from the cia , fbi and defense department have been studied thus far , according to the national archives .

there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .

with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .

she replaces paul spiegel , who ran the council since 2000 and who died of cancer in april at 68 . knobloch , who has served as council vice president since 1996 , was considered a shoo-in for the job .
she said wednesday that reconciliation between german jews and newcomers was a priority for her tenure . " the main focus of my work as president will be to promote the integration of immigrants from the former soviet union and the fight against growing anti-semitism , right-wing extremism and xenophobia , " she told reporters . she added that jews here now saw themselves as full-fledged members of german society " even if we are still far from a normal situation . " chancellor angela merkel hailed knobloch 's " active and tireless engagement " for the jewish community in europe and said the close cooperation between the government and the council would continue . the central council of jews is the main organization representing germany 's jewish community of about 100,000 .
on wednesday , dieter graumann , a 54-year-old financial expert from frankfurt , was elected vice-president to replace knobloch .
salomon korn , a 62-year-old architect , keeps his office as the council 's other vice-president and head of the jewish community in frankfurt .

her grandmother was killed in auschwitz and her father survived the war as a slave laborer .
they were reunited when she found him at a munich hospital . neuland became one of the founding members of munich 's vestigial jewish community in july 1945 , just two months after the war 's end .
he later became its president . in 1951 , she married samuel knobloch , a survivor of the krakow ghetto .
she had originally wanted to emigrate to the us but changed her mind after the birth of her first child and the professional success of her husband . decades later , after her three children finished school , knobloch became active in munich 's jewish community , attacking a surge in far-right violence after national reunification in 1990 and what she called " the new anti-semitism . " in 1985 , she became president of the israeli cultural society of munich and upper bavaria .
during her tenure , she spearheaded a new complex to serve munich 's 9,000 jews .
when completed in 2007 , it will consist of a new main synagogue , a community center and a museum . knobloch has also served since 2003 as vice president for the european jewish congress and since 2005 , the world jewish congress . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's jewish community begins search for new president as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun .

world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .
in 1906 , fifa had an annual turnover of 500 swiss francs -lrb- $ 411 -rrb- . court defeat a minor worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duplo stopped fifa from taking copyright too far but fifa has not had it all its own way .
germany 's federal supreme court gave the federation the red card when it tried to copyright the phrases " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 . "
this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ? " one could also apply to protect christmas or easter as trade marks , " said götz jordan of the duplo confectionary company , which contested fifa 's case . despite losing this battle , it looks like fifa will win the war .
federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .
while the federation will pocket a substantial sum , it wo n't take all of the money .
some of that will be paid to the ok and projects supported by fifa . germany 's money will then go into paying off its own costs .
the german state has put 3.7 billion euros into revamping its infrastructure with 1.5 billion euros going into the modernization of all twelve host stadiums . the host nation will recoup some more cash from the tourism aspect , with some 3.5 million visitors bumping up the bank balance through hotel fees , fuel costs and value added taxes -lrb- vat -rrb- . kaiser and co. pressure fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a disguised message to fifa ?
so is the world cup destined to become an even more bloated cash cow in future years ?
not if people like franz beckenbauer have anything to do with it .
the most prominent member of the ok has criticized the commercial behavior of fifa and has called for soccer to be " cleaned . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger has said that the marketing of soccer has reached its limits with this world cup . it appears that the criticism is starting to get through .
fifa president blatter reacted to the criticism by announcing a " self imposed restriction " after the world cup .
he announced that fifa would be looking more towards " optimum " world cups in future rather than " maximum . "
the hope is that fifa will put on more modest events after this world cup . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything " theo zwanziger is sleeping well these days .

since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .
in 1906 , fifa had an annual turnover of 500 swiss francs -lrb- $ 411 -rrb- . court defeat a minor worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duplo stopped fifa from taking copyright too far but fifa has not had it all its own way .
germany 's federal supreme court gave the federation the red card when it tried to copyright the phrases " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 . "
this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ? " one could also apply to protect christmas or easter as trade marks , " said götz jordan of the duplo confectionary company , which contested fifa 's case . despite losing this battle , it looks like fifa will win the war .
federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .
while the federation will pocket a substantial sum , it wo n't take all of the money .
some of that will be paid to the ok and projects supported by fifa . germany 's money will then go into paying off its own costs .
the german state has put 3.7 billion euros into revamping its infrastructure with 1.5 billion euros going into the modernization of all twelve host stadiums . the host nation will recoup some more cash from the tourism aspect , with some 3.5 million visitors bumping up the bank balance through hotel fees , fuel costs and value added taxes -lrb- vat -rrb- . kaiser and co. pressure fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a disguised message to fifa ?
so is the world cup destined to become an even more bloated cash cow in future years ?
not if people like franz beckenbauer have anything to do with it .
the most prominent member of the ok has criticized the commercial behavior of fifa and has called for soccer to be " cleaned . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger has said that the marketing of soccer has reached its limits with this world cup . it appears that the criticism is starting to get through .
fifa president blatter reacted to the criticism by announcing a " self imposed restriction " after the world cup .
he announced that fifa would be looking more towards " optimum " world cups in future rather than " maximum . "
the hope is that fifa will put on more modest events after this world cup . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything " theo zwanziger is sleeping well these days .
that 's surprising considering the dfb chief executive has been living and breathing the world cup for the past three years and his work will soon be under global scrutiny .

answer : the fifa world cup .

" racist attacks are a reality in germany , " the africa council , a group for expatriates , said in a statement posted on the internet in which it warned visitors to be particularly careful in the former communist east . " the likelihood of falling victim to racist attack is considerably higher in east germany and parts of east berlin than in west germany ... we therefore urge visitors to be especially careful , " the group said . it released the controversial guidelines in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany . their advice includes carrying a mobile phone whenever possible , traveling in groups if possible , and directions on how to deal with the police or to ask bystanders for help in case of attack . some members of the africa council , an umbrella group of immigrant associations , later distanced themselves from the guidelines .
these were released in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany .
heated debate the africa council has in recent weeks contributed to a heated debate about whether germany was a facing an upsurge in racism , particularly in the east of the country , and how this could effect its hard-won reputation for tolerance as it hosts the world cup .

the " world cup racism help line " offers advice in six languages and will be activated on thursday .
besides immediate support and assistance , hotline counselors will provide advice on dealing with german police and doctors . " we hope that we do n't get a single call , " said hot line organizer simplice freeman , who was born in cameroon .

authorities in germany consider it a worrying development since poland is one of germany 's neighbors and the two nations have been drawn to play each other in the first round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap beer and enthusiastic fans could prove a dangerous combination german security experts believe that the risk of violence is high for about a third of the 64 matches to be played in 12 cities .
police estimate that around 10,000 soccer fans are prone to violence . another area of concern is the more than 200 so-called public viewing sites across the country .
this is where fans without tickets can watch matches on giant video screens .
these potential flashpoints will be prime sites for the deployment of the international police officers in germany . close cooperation with britain german security authorities have been working especially closely with british police who have sent 79 officers .
they will be working with the german police at ports , airports and in trains and serve as liaison officers in the national information and cooperation center , the security headquarters for the world cup , which is based in berlin . " in england we 've been working very closely with our german government colleagues and our police colleagues for the past two years , " said steve thomas from the manchester police force and one of the cops helping out with the world cup .
" i was at the european championships 2004 and in the last four years i 've traveled europe for championship games and uefa cup games , and i can say without doubt that the level of cooperation is absolutely second to none , " thomas said .
" everything is being taken care of , everything is being planned for . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the worst-case scenario last week , for example , britain banned more than 3,000 known english hooligans from traveling to germany .
however , more than 300 of them have refused to hand in their passports to the authorities .
the british interior ministry has voiced fears that some of them may have already entered germany . nato surveillance planes take off in addition to the foreign hands helping out at the world cup , germany 's military will also be pitching in with around 7,000 soldiers .
they will be chiefly involved in possible air rescue operations and detecting radioactive materials if necessary . in addition , nato surveillance planes will monitor german airspace starting wednesday and will continue to do so until the tournament ends on july 9 . the last soccer world cup played in europe - in 1998 in france - was marred by violent hooligans who left a french policeman severely disabled . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup security , safety gets thumbs up from fifa the ninth european police congress featuring 1300 police officials from 65 countries opened in berlin tuesday with delegates focusing on security issues surrounding the world cup being held in germany this summer .

" i would counsel patience , " white house spokesman tony snow told reporters in washington on monday . " at this point , as we 've said all along , let 's give it time .
let 's let the iranians take a look at what the offers are , at the incentives and disincentives . " " there is hope " although the united states has not ruled out taking military action , diplomats say it has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if iran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington , whose ties with tehran were severed more than two decades ago , has banned most us trade and investment in the islamic republic since the mid-1990s . " the condition for getting to the negotiating table is to suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities .
that 's the first step .
should that happen , then the whole series of other things can take place , " snow said . " there 's neither optimism nor pessimism ; there is hope . " iran maintains defiant stance on saturday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that he had been asked by un secretary general kofi annan " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " but the president has consistently ruled out halting enrichment : " they say that they want to give us incentives .
they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange , " he said last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei also vowed sunday that his country would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes " and spoke of iran 's " scientific progress " as " representative of our political independence and national self-confidence .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know . " differing degrees of aid the report said that some countries , such as spain , turkey , germany and cyprus , provided " staging posts " for rendition operations , while portugal , ireland , greece and britain were stop-off points for cia flights .
britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .
macedonia was accused of covering up its involvement in the rendition of a german national , khaled el-masri , to afghanistan in january 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri 's account of his alleged abduction matches flight data but marty 's most serious charges were said to be against poland and romania , where there was now reportedly enough concrete evidence to support suspicions that the governments there allowed cia secret prisons on their soil . focus on poland marty 's evidence was based on flight plans filed with european air traffic controllers .
thousands of pages of data by eurocontrol , the air traffic agency , showed a " clear pattern " of " rendition circuits , " or specific missions for the transfer of prisoners .
trips were logged not only to romania but from afghanistan to poland .
and some matched accounts by prisoners of their abductions . the report details the cases of 18 terror suspects who were moved around europe .
and in a few cases , flights flew into romania and poland from kabul in what marty wrote could only be drop-off points for prisoners . in the case of poland , eurocontrol detailed a series of flights into szmany air base near warsaw .
marty has accused poland of failing to cooperate ; polish officials have said they have no record of the visit .

she replaces paul spiegel , who ran the council since 2000 and who died of cancer in april at 68 . knobloch , who has served as council vice president since 1996 , was considered a shoo-in for the job .
she said wednesday that reconciliation between german jews and newcomers was a priority for her tenure . " the main focus of my work as president will be to promote the integration of immigrants from the former soviet union and the fight against growing anti-semitism , right-wing extremism and xenophobia , " she told reporters . she added that jews here now saw themselves as full-fledged members of german society " even if we are still far from a normal situation . " chancellor angela merkel hailed knobloch 's " active and tireless engagement " for the jewish community in europe and said the close cooperation between the government and the council would continue . the central council of jews is the main organization representing germany 's jewish community of about 100,000 .
on wednesday , dieter graumann , a 54-year-old financial expert from frankfurt , was elected vice-president to replace knobloch .
salomon korn , a 62-year-old architect , keeps his office as the council 's other vice-president and head of the jewish community in frankfurt .

the layers are in so-called kimmeridgian rock of the late jurassic period , which makes them between 150 and 155 million years old . the creatures have body lengths ranging from 1.7 to 6.2 meters -lrb- 10.5-20 feet -rrb- , which seemed so preposterously small for sauropods that the team initially thought the specimens were juveniles . " holger 's reptile from europe " but a closer look at the skulls and isolated bones showed that they were in fact dwarfed adults . the species has been named europasaurus holgeri , or " holger 's reptile from europe , " in honor of holger luedtke , a self-taught paleontologist who found the first bones in 1998 . if e. holgeri were alive today , it would stand shoulder-high to an adult human , and its young would be about the size of a german shepherd dog . at the time when the little dinosaurs were alive , central europe was submerged by sea .
the theory is that they lived on one of the large islands around the lower saxony basin . " such islands would not have been able to support large-bodied sauropods , " says the study , which appears in nature , the weekly british science journal . " the ancestor of the europasaurus would have dwarfed rapidly on immigrating to the island , or as a response to shrinking land masses caused by rising sea levels , " the journal said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bronze age sky disc deciphered a group of german scientists has deciphered the meaning of one of the most spectacular archeological discoveries in recent years : the mystery-shrouded sky disc of nebra was used as an advanced astronomical clock .

she replaces paul spiegel , who ran the council since 2000 and who died of cancer in april at 68 . knobloch , who has served as council vice president since 1996 , was considered a shoo-in for the job .
she said wednesday that reconciliation between german jews and newcomers was a priority for her tenure . " the main focus of my work as president will be to promote the integration of immigrants from the former soviet union and the fight against growing anti-semitism , right-wing extremism and xenophobia , " she told reporters . she added that jews here now saw themselves as full-fledged members of german society " even if we are still far from a normal situation . " chancellor angela merkel hailed knobloch 's " active and tireless engagement " for the jewish community in europe and said the close cooperation between the government and the council would continue . the central council of jews is the main organization representing germany 's jewish community of about 100,000 .
on wednesday , dieter graumann , a 54-year-old financial expert from frankfurt , was elected vice-president to replace knobloch .
salomon korn , a 62-year-old architect , keeps his office as the council 's other vice-president and head of the jewish community in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch replaces paul spiegel , who died in april surviving the holocaust knobloch was born in 1932 in munich .
her father was fritz neuland , a prominent attorney and state senator .
during the war , knobloch was hidden by a young catholic woman on a farm in northern bavaria and passed off as her illegitimate daughter .
her grandmother was killed in auschwitz and her father survived the war as a slave laborer .
they were reunited when she found him at a munich hospital . neuland became one of the founding members of munich 's vestigial jewish community in july 1945 , just two months after the war 's end .
he later became its president . in 1951 , she married samuel knobloch , a survivor of the krakow ghetto .
she had originally wanted to emigrate to the us but changed her mind after the birth of her first child and the professional success of her husband . decades later , after her three children finished school , knobloch became active in munich 's jewish community , attacking a surge in far-right violence after national reunification in 1990 and what she called " the new anti-semitism . " in 1985 , she became president of the israeli cultural society of munich and upper bavaria .
during her tenure , she spearheaded a new complex to serve munich 's 9,000 jews .
when completed in 2007 , it will consist of a new main synagogue , a community center and a museum . knobloch has also served since 2003 as vice president for the european jewish congress and since 2005 , the world jewish congress . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's jewish community begins search for new president as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun .

" racist attacks are a reality in germany , " the africa council , a group for expatriates , said in a statement posted on the internet in which it warned visitors to be particularly careful in the former communist east . " the likelihood of falling victim to racist attack is considerably higher in east germany and parts of east berlin than in west germany ... we therefore urge visitors to be especially careful , " the group said . it released the controversial guidelines in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany . their advice includes carrying a mobile phone whenever possible , traveling in groups if possible , and directions on how to deal with the police or to ask bystanders for help in case of attack . some members of the africa council , an umbrella group of immigrant associations , later distanced themselves from the guidelines .
these were released in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany .
heated debate the africa council has in recent weeks contributed to a heated debate about whether germany was a facing an upsurge in racism , particularly in the east of the country , and how this could effect its hard-won reputation for tolerance as it hosts the world cup .

besides immediate support and assistance , hotline counselors will provide advice on dealing with german police and doctors . " we hope that we do n't get a single call , " said hot line organizer simplice freeman , who was born in cameroon .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know . " differing degrees of aid the report said that some countries , such as spain , turkey , germany and cyprus , provided " staging posts " for rendition operations , while portugal , ireland , greece and britain were stop-off points for cia flights .
britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .
macedonia was accused of covering up its involvement in the rendition of a german national , khaled el-masri , to afghanistan in january 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri 's account of his alleged abduction matches flight data but marty 's most serious charges were said to be against poland and romania , where there was now reportedly enough concrete evidence to support suspicions that the governments there allowed cia secret prisons on their soil . focus on poland marty 's evidence was based on flight plans filed with european air traffic controllers .

she replaces paul spiegel , who ran the council since 2000 and who died of cancer in april at 68 . knobloch , who has served as council vice president since 1996 , was considered a shoo-in for the job .
she said wednesday that reconciliation between german jews and newcomers was a priority for her tenure . " the main focus of my work as president will be to promote the integration of immigrants from the former soviet union and the fight against growing anti-semitism , right-wing extremism and xenophobia , " she told reporters . she added that jews here now saw themselves as full-fledged members of german society " even if we are still far from a normal situation . " chancellor angela merkel hailed knobloch 's " active and tireless engagement " for the jewish community in europe and said the close cooperation between the government and the council would continue . the central council of jews is the main organization representing germany 's jewish community of about 100,000 .
on wednesday , dieter graumann , a 54-year-old financial expert from frankfurt , was elected vice-president to replace knobloch .
salomon korn , a 62-year-old architect , keeps his office as the council 's other vice-president and head of the jewish community in frankfurt .

during the war , knobloch was hidden by a young catholic woman on a farm in northern bavaria and passed off as her illegitimate daughter .
her grandmother was killed in auschwitz and her father survived the war as a slave laborer .
they were reunited when she found him at a munich hospital . neuland became one of the founding members of munich 's vestigial jewish community in july 1945 , just two months after the war 's end .
he later became its president . in 1951 , she married samuel knobloch , a survivor of the krakow ghetto .
she had originally wanted to emigrate to the us but changed her mind after the birth of her first child and the professional success of her husband . decades later , after her three children finished school , knobloch became active in munich 's jewish community , attacking a surge in far-right violence after national reunification in 1990 and what she called " the new anti-semitism . " in 1985 , she became president of the israeli cultural society of munich and upper bavaria .
during her tenure , she spearheaded a new complex to serve munich 's 9,000 jews .
when completed in 2007 , it will consist of a new main synagogue , a community center and a museum . knobloch has also served since 2003 as vice president for the european jewish congress and since 2005 , the world jewish congress . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's jewish community begins search for new president as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know . " differing degrees of aid the report said that some countries , such as spain , turkey , germany and cyprus , provided " staging posts " for rendition operations , while portugal , ireland , greece and britain were stop-off points for cia flights .
britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .
macedonia was accused of covering up its involvement in the rendition of a german national , khaled el-masri , to afghanistan in january 2004 .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know . " differing degrees of aid the report said that some countries , such as spain , turkey , germany and cyprus , provided " staging posts " for rendition operations , while portugal , ireland , greece and britain were stop-off points for cia flights .
britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .
macedonia was accused of covering up its involvement in the rendition of a german national , khaled el-masri , to afghanistan in january 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri 's account of his alleged abduction matches flight data but marty 's most serious charges were said to be against poland and romania , where there was now reportedly enough concrete evidence to support suspicions that the governments there allowed cia secret prisons on their soil . focus on poland marty 's evidence was based on flight plans filed with european air traffic controllers .
thousands of pages of data by eurocontrol , the air traffic agency , showed a " clear pattern " of " rendition circuits , " or specific missions for the transfer of prisoners .
trips were logged not only to romania but from afghanistan to poland .
and some matched accounts by prisoners of their abductions . the report details the cases of 18 terror suspects who were moved around europe .
and in a few cases , flights flew into romania and poland from kabul in what marty wrote could only be drop-off points for prisoners . in the case of poland , eurocontrol detailed a series of flights into szmany air base near warsaw .
marty has accused poland of failing to cooperate ; polish officials have said they have no record of the visit .
" poland can not be considered to be outside the rendition circuits simply because it has failed to furnish information corroborating my data from other source , " the report said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers complain of us stonewalling on cia flights european lawmakers visiting washington to probe the alleged illegal detentions and transport of terror suspects in europe by the cia said they were not getting much information from us officials .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know . " differing degrees of aid the report said that some countries , such as spain , turkey , germany and cyprus , provided " staging posts " for rendition operations , while portugal , ireland , greece and britain were stop-off points for cia flights .
britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .
macedonia was accused of covering up its involvement in the rendition of a german national , khaled el-masri , to afghanistan in january 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri 's account of his alleged abduction matches flight data but marty 's most serious charges were said to be against poland and romania , where there was now reportedly enough concrete evidence to support suspicions that the governments there allowed cia secret prisons on their soil . focus on poland marty 's evidence was based on flight plans filed with european air traffic controllers .
thousands of pages of data by eurocontrol , the air traffic agency , showed a " clear pattern " of " rendition circuits , " or specific missions for the transfer of prisoners .
trips were logged not only to romania but from afghanistan to poland .
and some matched accounts by prisoners of their abductions . the report details the cases of 18 terror suspects who were moved around europe .
and in a few cases , flights flew into romania and poland from kabul in what marty wrote could only be drop-off points for prisoners . in the case of poland , eurocontrol detailed a series of flights into szmany air base near warsaw .
marty has accused poland of failing to cooperate ; polish officials have said they have no record of the visit .

she replaces paul spiegel , who ran the council since 2000 and who died of cancer in april at 68 . knobloch , who has served as council vice president since 1996 , was considered a shoo-in for the job .
she said wednesday that reconciliation between german jews and newcomers was a priority for her tenure . " the main focus of my work as president will be to promote the integration of immigrants from the former soviet union and the fight against growing anti-semitism , right-wing extremism and xenophobia , " she told reporters . she added that jews here now saw themselves as full-fledged members of german society " even if we are still far from a normal situation . " chancellor angela merkel hailed knobloch 's " active and tireless engagement " for the jewish community in europe and said the close cooperation between the government and the council would continue . the central council of jews is the main organization representing germany 's jewish community of about 100,000 .
on wednesday , dieter graumann , a 54-year-old financial expert from frankfurt , was elected vice-president to replace knobloch .
salomon korn , a 62-year-old architect , keeps his office as the council 's other vice-president and head of the jewish community in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch replaces paul spiegel , who died in april surviving the holocaust knobloch was born in 1932 in munich .
her father was fritz neuland , a prominent attorney and state senator .
during the war , knobloch was hidden by a young catholic woman on a farm in northern bavaria and passed off as her illegitimate daughter .
her grandmother was killed in auschwitz and her father survived the war as a slave laborer .
they were reunited when she found him at a munich hospital . neuland became one of the founding members of munich 's vestigial jewish community in july 1945 , just two months after the war 's end .
he later became its president . in 1951 , she married samuel knobloch , a survivor of the krakow ghetto .
she had originally wanted to emigrate to the us but changed her mind after the birth of her first child and the professional success of her husband . decades later , after her three children finished school , knobloch became active in munich 's jewish community , attacking a surge in far-right violence after national reunification in 1990 and what she called " the new anti-semitism . " in 1985 , she became president of the israeli cultural society of munich and upper bavaria .
during her tenure , she spearheaded a new complex to serve munich 's 9,000 jews .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.06.2006 european governments aided in cia abductions , says report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flight data obtained by investigators confirm secret flights a new report released wednesday by europe 's top human rights body provides more details about european aid to the us in transporting terrorism suspects and the existence of secret prisons in eastern europe . some countries provided staging help with extraordinary rendition , in which the cia secretly flew terror suspects through europe to countries where they could have been tortured .
others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know . " differing degrees of aid the report said that some countries , such as spain , turkey , germany and cyprus , provided " staging posts " for rendition operations , while portugal , ireland , greece and britain were stop-off points for cia flights .
britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .
macedonia was accused of covering up its involvement in the rendition of a german national , khaled el-masri , to afghanistan in january 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri 's account of his alleged abduction matches flight data but marty 's most serious charges were said to be against poland and romania , where there was now reportedly enough concrete evidence to support suspicions that the governments there allowed cia secret prisons on their soil . focus on poland marty 's evidence was based on flight plans filed with european air traffic controllers .

marty has accused poland of failing to cooperate ; polish officials have said they have no record of the visit .

the offer has been drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . " now that the proposal is on the table , i hope we will receive a positive response which will be satisfactory to both sides , " he said after also meeting foreign minister manouchehr mottaki and ending his whirlwind visit to tehran . patience needed western officials have said iran - which has so far refused to freeze enrichment work - will be expected to give its response within a matter of weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani a string of tough comments from iranian officials have left many diplomats fearing that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival - but larijani asserted that it would be studied .

" the package , presented by european union foreign policy chief javier solana , offers a variety of incentives and fresh multilateral talks if the islamic republic agrees to suspend uranium enrichment work , which can make both reactor fuel and weapons . " there are positive steps in the proposal , and there are also some ambiguities that should be cleared up , " iran 's top national security official ali larijani said on state television . " we consider that the europeans will to solve the issue through talks is a correct step , and we welcome this , " he said after receiving the proposal and holding two hours of talks with solana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana arrived in tehran late monday " we had good discussions , " solana said , while asserting that " there is a strong consensus between the six countries " behind the package .
the offer has been drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . " now that the proposal is on the table , i hope we will receive a positive response which will be satisfactory to both sides , " he said after also meeting foreign minister manouchehr mottaki and ending his whirlwind visit to tehran . patience needed western officials have said iran - which has so far refused to freeze enrichment work - will be expected to give its response within a matter of weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani a string of tough comments from iranian officials have left many diplomats fearing that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival - but larijani asserted that it would be studied . " they submitted the proposals and the discussions were good .
we have to examine these proposals and then we will give our response , " he said . he did not elaborate on what the " ambiguities " were - but iran will undoubtedly have questions over the scope and duration of a nuclear suspension . iranian officials have signaled they may be willing to hold off on industrial-scale enrichment , but they say " research " work can not be halted . while being offered carrots , iran also faces the stick of robust security council action - including a range of possible sanctions - if it rejects the offer and continues what the west fears is a covert weapons drive . " i would counsel patience , " white house spokesman tony snow told reporters in washington on monday . " at this point , as we 've said all along , let 's give it time .
let 's let the iranians take a look at what the offers are , at the incentives and disincentives . " " there is hope " although the united states has not ruled out taking military action , diplomats say it has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if iran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington , whose ties with tehran were severed more than two decades ago , has banned most us trade and investment in the islamic republic since the mid-1990s . " the condition for getting to the negotiating table is to suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities .
that 's the first step .
should that happen , then the whole series of other things can take place , " snow said . " there 's neither optimism nor pessimism ; there is hope . " iran maintains defiant stance on saturday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that he had been asked by un secretary general kofi annan " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " but the president has consistently ruled out halting enrichment : " they say that they want to give us incentives .
they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange , " he said last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei also vowed sunday that his country would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes " and spoke of iran 's " scientific progress " as " representative of our political independence and national self-confidence .

world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .
in 1906 , fifa had an annual turnover of 500 swiss francs -lrb- $ 411 -rrb- . court defeat a minor worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duplo stopped fifa from taking copyright too far but fifa has not had it all its own way .
germany 's federal supreme court gave the federation the red card when it tried to copyright the phrases " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 . "
this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ? " one could also apply to protect christmas or easter as trade marks , " said götz jordan of the duplo confectionary company , which contested fifa 's case . despite losing this battle , it looks like fifa will win the war .
federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .
while the federation will pocket a substantial sum , it wo n't take all of the money .
some of that will be paid to the ok and projects supported by fifa . germany 's money will then go into paying off its own costs .
the german state has put 3.7 billion euros into revamping its infrastructure with 1.5 billion euros going into the modernization of all twelve host stadiums . the host nation will recoup some more cash from the tourism aspect , with some 3.5 million visitors bumping up the bank balance through hotel fees , fuel costs and value added taxes -lrb- vat -rrb- . kaiser and co. pressure fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a disguised message to fifa ?
so is the world cup destined to become an even more bloated cash cow in future years ?
not if people like franz beckenbauer have anything to do with it .
the most prominent member of the ok has criticized the commercial behavior of fifa and has called for soccer to be " cleaned . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger has said that the marketing of soccer has reached its limits with this world cup . it appears that the criticism is starting to get through .

police officers from 13 nations have arrived in the country to help identify and rein in potential troublemakers . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble on tuesday welcomed a group of 300 police officers from 13 countries to help german authorities boost security during the four-week tournament . " we are now very well prepared at all levels of security .
this includes germany 's municipalities , regions and the nation as a whole , but also as far as cooperation with international authorities and police is concerned , " schäuble said .
" although you can never guarantee 100 percent security , i 'm convinced people will feel safe here and enjoy a happy world cup , " he added . schäuble said the foreign police officers would be given wide-ranging powers - they will check the identification of people , ban troublemakers from stadiums and other places as well as detain violent fans . german authorities believe that the wide availability of cheap beer and the fact that germany is served by low-budget flights from all over europe make the 2006 world cup a potentially high-risk event .
they admit that , right now , they are more worried about soccer hooligans than they are about al qaeda .
german police have been busy for some time amassing intelligence from around the world to prevent known hooligans from entering the country .
new worries traditionally , trouble from hooligans has come from english , dutch and german fans .

police estimate that around 10,000 soccer fans are prone to violence . another area of concern is the more than 200 so-called public viewing sites across the country .
this is where fans without tickets can watch matches on giant video screens .
these potential flashpoints will be prime sites for the deployment of the international police officers in germany . close cooperation with britain german security authorities have been working especially closely with british police who have sent 79 officers .
they will be working with the german police at ports , airports and in trains and serve as liaison officers in the national information and cooperation center , the security headquarters for the world cup , which is based in berlin . " in england we 've been working very closely with our german government colleagues and our police colleagues for the past two years , " said steve thomas from the manchester police force and one of the cops helping out with the world cup .
" i was at the european championships 2004 and in the last four years i 've traveled europe for championship games and uefa cup games , and i can say without doubt that the level of cooperation is absolutely second to none , " thomas said .
" everything is being taken care of , everything is being planned for . "

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism .

some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know . " differing degrees of aid the report said that some countries , such as spain , turkey , germany and cyprus , provided " staging posts " for rendition operations , while portugal , ireland , greece and britain were stop-off points for cia flights .
britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .
macedonia was accused of covering up its involvement in the rendition of a german national , khaled el-masri , to afghanistan in january 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri 's account of his alleged abduction matches flight data but marty 's most serious charges were said to be against poland and romania , where there was now reportedly enough concrete evidence to support suspicions that the governments there allowed cia secret prisons on their soil . focus on poland marty 's evidence was based on flight plans filed with european air traffic controllers .
thousands of pages of data by eurocontrol , the air traffic agency , showed a " clear pattern " of " rendition circuits , " or specific missions for the transfer of prisoners .
trips were logged not only to romania but from afghanistan to poland .
and some matched accounts by prisoners of their abductions . the report details the cases of 18 terror suspects who were moved around europe .
and in a few cases , flights flew into romania and poland from kabul in what marty wrote could only be drop-off points for prisoners . in the case of poland , eurocontrol detailed a series of flights into szmany air base near warsaw .
marty has accused poland of failing to cooperate ; polish officials have said they have no record of the visit .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of pages of archives have been released " when one knows the hunt for eichmann was prolonged because the israelis knew that he was in argentina but did not know the alias under which he was hiding , one understands completely the importance of these documents , " naftali told afp .
" the west germans at the time had the responsibility of arresting or at least transmitting this information and it is they who are the most guilty . " an executor of the " final solution " the israelis kidnapped eichmann , one of the main executors of adolf hitler 's " final solution , " the nazi genocide of jews during world war ii , in buenos aires in 1960 .
he was brought secretly to israel , where he was tried , convicted and hung in 1962 . the cia documents reveal that the united states , at the request of west germany , successfully pressured the us magazine " life , " which had acquired the rights to publish eichmann 's memoir , to delete a reference to globke , naftali said . they also show that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer met with israeli leader david ben-gurion in ny while the german government protected a cabinet minister who was a former nazi " the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " naftali said .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . " shedding new light since 1999 a task force mandated by the us congress has been researching the national archives and documents as they are declassified to shed light on the relations between us authorities and nazi war criminals after world war ii . the group 's work also focuses on us aid given to certain leaders of the japanese regime in power during the 1930s and 1940s . some eight million pages from the cia , fbi and defense department have been studied thus far , according to the national archives .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know . " differing degrees of aid the report said that some countries , such as spain , turkey , germany and cyprus , provided " staging posts " for rendition operations , while portugal , ireland , greece and britain were stop-off points for cia flights .
britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .
macedonia was accused of covering up its involvement in the rendition of a german national , khaled el-masri , to afghanistan in january 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri 's account of his alleged abduction matches flight data but marty 's most serious charges were said to be against poland and romania , where there was now reportedly enough concrete evidence to support suspicions that the governments there allowed cia secret prisons on their soil . focus on poland marty 's evidence was based on flight plans filed with european air traffic controllers .
thousands of pages of data by eurocontrol , the air traffic agency , showed a " clear pattern " of " rendition circuits , " or specific missions for the transfer of prisoners .
trips were logged not only to romania but from afghanistan to poland .
and some matched accounts by prisoners of their abductions . the report details the cases of 18 terror suspects who were moved around europe .
and in a few cases , flights flew into romania and poland from kabul in what marty wrote could only be drop-off points for prisoners . in the case of poland , eurocontrol detailed a series of flights into szmany air base near warsaw .
marty has accused poland of failing to cooperate ; polish officials have said they have no record of the visit .

the layers are in so-called kimmeridgian rock of the late jurassic period , which makes them between 150 and 155 million years old . the creatures have body lengths ranging from 1.7 to 6.2 meters -lrb- 10.5-20 feet -rrb- , which seemed so preposterously small for sauropods that the team initially thought the specimens were juveniles . " holger 's reptile from europe " but a closer look at the skulls and isolated bones showed that they were in fact dwarfed adults . the species has been named europasaurus holgeri , or " holger 's reptile from europe , " in honor of holger luedtke , a self-taught paleontologist who found the first bones in 1998 . if e. holgeri were alive today , it would stand shoulder-high to an adult human , and its young would be about the size of a german shepherd dog . at the time when the little dinosaurs were alive , central europe was submerged by sea .
the theory is that they lived on one of the large islands around the lower saxony basin . " such islands would not have been able to support large-bodied sauropods , " says the study , which appears in nature , the weekly british science journal . " the ancestor of the europasaurus would have dwarfed rapidly on immigrating to the island , or as a response to shrinking land masses caused by rising sea levels , " the journal said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bronze age sky disc deciphered a group of german scientists has deciphered the meaning of one of the most spectacular archeological discoveries in recent years : the mystery-shrouded sky disc of nebra was used as an advanced astronomical clock .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know . " differing degrees of aid the report said that some countries , such as spain , turkey , germany and cyprus , provided " staging posts " for rendition operations , while portugal , ireland , greece and britain were stop-off points for cia flights .
britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .
macedonia was accused of covering up its involvement in the rendition of a german national , khaled el-masri , to afghanistan in january 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri 's account of his alleged abduction matches flight data but marty 's most serious charges were said to be against poland and romania , where there was now reportedly enough concrete evidence to support suspicions that the governments there allowed cia secret prisons on their soil . focus on poland marty 's evidence was based on flight plans filed with european air traffic controllers .
thousands of pages of data by eurocontrol , the air traffic agency , showed a " clear pattern " of " rendition circuits , " or specific missions for the transfer of prisoners .
trips were logged not only to romania but from afghanistan to poland .
and some matched accounts by prisoners of their abductions . the report details the cases of 18 terror suspects who were moved around europe .
and in a few cases , flights flew into romania and poland from kabul in what marty wrote could only be drop-off points for prisoners . in the case of poland , eurocontrol detailed a series of flights into szmany air base near warsaw .
marty has accused poland of failing to cooperate ; polish officials have said they have no record of the visit .
" poland can not be considered to be outside the rendition circuits simply because it has failed to furnish information corroborating my data from other source , " the report said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers complain of us stonewalling on cia flights european lawmakers visiting washington to probe the alleged illegal detentions and transport of terror suspects in europe by the cia said they were not getting much information from us officials .

" the condition for getting to the negotiating table is to suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities .

" they submitted the proposals and the discussions were good .
we have to examine these proposals and then we will give our response , " he said . he did not elaborate on what the " ambiguities " were - but iran will undoubtedly have questions over the scope and duration of a nuclear suspension . iranian officials have signaled they may be willing to hold off on industrial-scale enrichment , but they say " research " work can not be halted . while being offered carrots , iran also faces the stick of robust security council action - including a range of possible sanctions - if it rejects the offer and continues what the west fears is a covert weapons drive . " i would counsel patience , " white house spokesman tony snow told reporters in washington on monday . " at this point , as we 've said all along , let 's give it time .
let 's let the iranians take a look at what the offers are , at the incentives and disincentives . " " there is hope " although the united states has not ruled out taking military action , diplomats say it has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if iran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington , whose ties with tehran were severed more than two decades ago , has banned most us trade and investment in the islamic republic since the mid-1990s . " the condition for getting to the negotiating table is to suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities .
that 's the first step .
should that happen , then the whole series of other things can take place , " snow said . " there 's neither optimism nor pessimism ; there is hope . " iran maintains defiant stance on saturday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that he had been asked by un secretary general kofi annan " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " but the president has consistently ruled out halting enrichment : " they say that they want to give us incentives .
they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange , " he said last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei also vowed sunday that his country would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes " and spoke of iran 's " scientific progress " as " representative of our political independence and national self-confidence .

others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know . " differing degrees of aid the report said that some countries , such as spain , turkey , germany and cyprus , provided " staging posts " for rendition operations , while portugal , ireland , greece and britain were stop-off points for cia flights .
britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .
macedonia was accused of covering up its involvement in the rendition of a german national , khaled el-masri , to afghanistan in january 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri 's account of his alleged abduction matches flight data but marty 's most serious charges were said to be against poland and romania , where there was now reportedly enough concrete evidence to support suspicions that the governments there allowed cia secret prisons on their soil . focus on poland marty 's evidence was based on flight plans filed with european air traffic controllers .
thousands of pages of data by eurocontrol , the air traffic agency , showed a " clear pattern " of " rendition circuits , " or specific missions for the transfer of prisoners .
trips were logged not only to romania but from afghanistan to poland .
and some matched accounts by prisoners of their abductions . the report details the cases of 18 terror suspects who were moved around europe .
and in a few cases , flights flew into romania and poland from kabul in what marty wrote could only be drop-off points for prisoners . in the case of poland , eurocontrol detailed a series of flights into szmany air base near warsaw .
marty has accused poland of failing to cooperate ; polish officials have said they have no record of the visit .

world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .

german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .

this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ? " one could also apply to protect christmas or easter as trade marks , " said götz jordan of the duplo confectionary company , which contested fifa 's case . despite losing this battle , it looks like fifa will win the war .
federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .
while the federation will pocket a substantial sum , it wo n't take all of the money .
some of that will be paid to the ok and projects supported by fifa . germany 's money will then go into paying off its own costs .
the german state has put 3.7 billion euros into revamping its infrastructure with 1.5 billion euros going into the modernization of all twelve host stadiums . the host nation will recoup some more cash from the tourism aspect , with some 3.5 million visitors bumping up the bank balance through hotel fees , fuel costs and value added taxes -lrb- vat -rrb- . kaiser and co. pressure fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a disguised message to fifa ?

the most prominent member of the ok has criticized the commercial behavior of fifa and has called for soccer to be " cleaned . "
german soccer association president theo zwanziger has said that the marketing of soccer has reached its limits with this world cup . it appears that the criticism is starting to get through .
fifa president blatter reacted to the criticism by announcing a " self imposed restriction " after the world cup .
he announced that fifa would be looking more towards " optimum " world cups in future rather than " maximum . "
the hope is that fifa will put on more modest events after this world cup . ina rottscheidt -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans ca n't always perfectly organize everything " theo zwanziger is sleeping well these days .

world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .
in 1906 , fifa had an annual turnover of 500 swiss francs -lrb- $ 411 -rrb- . court defeat a minor worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duplo stopped fifa from taking copyright too far but fifa has not had it all its own way .
germany 's federal supreme court gave the federation the red card when it tried to copyright the phrases " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 . "
this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ? " one could also apply to protect christmas or easter as trade marks , " said götz jordan of the duplo confectionary company , which contested fifa 's case . despite losing this battle , it looks like fifa will win the war .
federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .
while the federation will pocket a substantial sum , it wo n't take all of the money .
some of that will be paid to the ok and projects supported by fifa . germany 's money will then go into paying off its own costs .
the german state has put 3.7 billion euros into revamping its infrastructure with 1.5 billion euros going into the modernization of all twelve host stadiums . the host nation will recoup some more cash from the tourism aspect , with some 3.5 million visitors bumping up the bank balance through hotel fees , fuel costs and value added taxes -lrb- vat -rrb- . kaiser and co. pressure fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a disguised message to fifa ?
so is the world cup destined to become an even more bloated cash cow in future years ?

world soccer 's governing body has assumed almost total control and the german hosts are increasingly pushed aside .
there is , not surprisingly , trouble in soccer paradise . world soccer 's governing body fifa rightly claims to be the creator of the world cup .
in fact , the creation of a world championship soccer tournament was one of the main reasons why fifa came into being 100 years ago in zurich .
since then , fifa has overseen some 17 world cups and has been the proud observer of some of soccer 's most memorable moments . despite a rich history and long involvement in the global soccer showpiece , fifa has only really got its teeth into the business side of the tournament this year .
with the 2006 world cup in germany , fifa has gone into marketing and media overdrive . fifa 's 2006 offensive on the senses and bank balances of soccer fans all over the world has generated annoyance and criticism .
how , some argue , can an organization which claims to be committed to the ideals of sports and friendship attached to the world cup be so concerned with such a massive commercial quest ? and it is n't only the supporters who have taken offense to fifa 's seemingly insatiable hunger for sales and profits .
cracks are forming in its relationship with the german organizing committee -lrb- ok -rrb- as fifa allegedly pockets millions from the sales of tickets at the expense of fans . the ticket saga is just the tip of a presumably fifa-branded iceberg .
merchandise sellers and event organizers have already felt the weight of fifa 's heavy hand when it comes to the use of branded phrases .
when a spoof letter recently circulated around cologne stating that no-one was allowed to wear anything but fifa approved clothing or sing any unlicensed world cup song within a certain area on match days , people now accustomed to the organization 's control-freakery took it as authentic . no name too big to fall foul of fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking down the allianz name - fifa insisted fifa has developed into a mighty economic enterprise whose influence stretches far beyond the confines of the soccer stadium .
such is its reach that hamburg 's aol arena has had to remove its name for the duration of the world cup , since the computer company is not an official partner , as has munich 's allianz arena . the logo on sportswear giant nike 's headquarters in frankfurt has also been covered after fifa took umbrage to it . fifa has turned itself into an " occupying power " in germany , dictating what can and can not be shown and where .
german businesses and politicians are in uproar over fifa imposed zones around stadiums where only official sponsors can advertise ; for example , milk can not be used on match days in the coca cola area . considering the amount of money the sponsors have to spend to get this kind of treatment , they should demand nothing less .
according to fifa marketing boss gregor lentze , the money generated by the 15 major sponsors is close to 700 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- , all heading into the federation 's coffer .
it is a marked contrast to the organizations humble beginnings .
in 1906 , fifa had an annual turnover of 500 swiss francs -lrb- $ 411 -rrb- . court defeat a minor worry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : duplo stopped fifa from taking copyright too far but fifa has not had it all its own way .
germany 's federal supreme court gave the federation the red card when it tried to copyright the phrases " world cup 2006 " and " football world cup 2006 . "
this attempt to corner even more of the market was rejected by the court which argued that if such phrases were owned by an organization where would it end ? " one could also apply to protect christmas or easter as trade marks , " said götz jordan of the duplo confectionary company , which contested fifa 's case . despite losing this battle , it looks like fifa will win the war .
federation president joseph blatter is expected to deliver good news at the fifa congress in munich on wednesday , announcing an annual fifa income of around 1.86 billion euros from the world cup .
while the federation will pocket a substantial sum , it wo n't take all of the money .
some of that will be paid to the ok and projects supported by fifa . germany 's money will then go into paying off its own costs .
the german state has put 3.7 billion euros into revamping its infrastructure with 1.5 billion euros going into the modernization of all twelve host stadiums . the host nation will recoup some more cash from the tourism aspect , with some 3.5 million visitors bumping up the bank balance through hotel fees , fuel costs and value added taxes -lrb- vat -rrb- . kaiser and co. pressure fifa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a disguised message to fifa ?
so is the world cup destined to become an even more bloated cash cow in future years ?
not if people like franz beckenbauer have anything to do with it .

" the package , presented by european union foreign policy chief javier solana , offers a variety of incentives and fresh multilateral talks if the islamic republic agrees to suspend uranium enrichment work , which can make both reactor fuel and weapons . " there are positive steps in the proposal , and there are also some ambiguities that should be cleared up , " iran 's top national security official ali larijani said on state television . " we consider that the europeans will to solve the issue through talks is a correct step , and we welcome this , " he said after receiving the proposal and holding two hours of talks with solana . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana arrived in tehran late monday " we had good discussions , " solana said , while asserting that " there is a strong consensus between the six countries " behind the package .
the offer has been drawn up by britain , france and germany and backed by the united states , russia and china . " now that the proposal is on the table , i hope we will receive a positive response which will be satisfactory to both sides , " he said after also meeting foreign minister manouchehr mottaki and ending his whirlwind visit to tehran . patience needed western officials have said iran - which has so far refused to freeze enrichment work - will be expected to give its response within a matter of weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani a string of tough comments from iranian officials have left many diplomats fearing that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival - but larijani asserted that it would be studied . " they submitted the proposals and the discussions were good .
we have to examine these proposals and then we will give our response , " he said . he did not elaborate on what the " ambiguities " were - but iran will undoubtedly have questions over the scope and duration of a nuclear suspension . iranian officials have signaled they may be willing to hold off on industrial-scale enrichment , but they say " research " work can not be halted . while being offered carrots , iran also faces the stick of robust security council action - including a range of possible sanctions - if it rejects the offer and continues what the west fears is a covert weapons drive . " i would counsel patience , " white house spokesman tony snow told reporters in washington on monday . " at this point , as we 've said all along , let 's give it time .
let 's let the iranians take a look at what the offers are , at the incentives and disincentives . " " there is hope " although the united states has not ruled out taking military action , diplomats say it has helped sweeten the package by offering to lift certain sanctions if iran agrees to an enrichment freeze . washington , whose ties with tehran were severed more than two decades ago , has banned most us trade and investment in the islamic republic since the mid-1990s . " the condition for getting to the negotiating table is to suspend enrichment-related and reprocessing activities .
that 's the first step .
should that happen , then the whole series of other things can take place , " snow said . " there 's neither optimism nor pessimism ; there is hope . " iran maintains defiant stance on saturday , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that he had been asked by un secretary general kofi annan " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " but the president has consistently ruled out halting enrichment : " they say that they want to give us incentives .
they think that they can take away our gold and give us some nuts and chocolate in exchange , " he said last month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei also vowed sunday that his country would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes " and spoke of iran 's " scientific progress " as " representative of our political independence and national self-confidence .

the layers are in so-called kimmeridgian rock of the late jurassic period , which makes them between 150 and 155 million years old . the creatures have body lengths ranging from 1.7 to 6.2 meters -lrb- 10.5-20 feet -rrb- , which seemed so preposterously small for sauropods that the team initially thought the specimens were juveniles . " holger 's reptile from europe " but a closer look at the skulls and isolated bones showed that they were in fact dwarfed adults . the species has been named europasaurus holgeri , or " holger 's reptile from europe , " in honor of holger luedtke , a self-taught paleontologist who found the first bones in 1998 . if e. holgeri were alive today , it would stand shoulder-high to an adult human , and its young would be about the size of a german shepherd dog . at the time when the little dinosaurs were alive , central europe was submerged by sea .

the layers are in so-called kimmeridgian rock of the late jurassic period , which makes them between 150 and 155 million years old . the creatures have body lengths ranging from 1.7 to 6.2 meters -lrb- 10.5-20 feet -rrb- , which seemed so preposterously small for sauropods that the team initially thought the specimens were juveniles . " holger 's reptile from europe " but a closer look at the skulls and isolated bones showed that they were in fact dwarfed adults . the species has been named europasaurus holgeri , or " holger 's reptile from europe , " in honor of holger luedtke , a self-taught paleontologist who found the first bones in 1998 . if e. holgeri were alive today , it would stand shoulder-high to an adult human , and its young would be about the size of a german shepherd dog . at the time when the little dinosaurs were alive , central europe was submerged by sea .

police officers from 13 nations have arrived in the country to help identify and rein in potential troublemakers . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble on tuesday welcomed a group of 300 police officers from 13 countries to help german authorities boost security during the four-week tournament . " we are now very well prepared at all levels of security .
this includes germany 's municipalities , regions and the nation as a whole , but also as far as cooperation with international authorities and police is concerned , " schäuble said .
" although you can never guarantee 100 percent security , i 'm convinced people will feel safe here and enjoy a happy world cup , " he added . schäuble said the foreign police officers would be given wide-ranging powers - they will check the identification of people , ban troublemakers from stadiums and other places as well as detain violent fans . german authorities believe that the wide availability of cheap beer and the fact that germany is served by low-budget flights from all over europe make the 2006 world cup a potentially high-risk event .
they admit that , right now , they are more worried about soccer hooligans than they are about al qaeda .
german police have been busy for some time amassing intelligence from around the world to prevent known hooligans from entering the country .
new worries traditionally , trouble from hooligans has come from english , dutch and german fans .
but recent reports from poland suggest that a radical hooligan fringe is on the rise there .
authorities in germany consider it a worrying development since poland is one of germany 's neighbors and the two nations have been drawn to play each other in the first round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap beer and enthusiastic fans could prove a dangerous combination german security experts believe that the risk of violence is high for about a third of the 64 matches to be played in 12 cities .
police estimate that around 10,000 soccer fans are prone to violence . another area of concern is the more than 200 so-called public viewing sites across the country .
this is where fans without tickets can watch matches on giant video screens .
these potential flashpoints will be prime sites for the deployment of the international police officers in germany . close cooperation with britain german security authorities have been working especially closely with british police who have sent 79 officers .
they will be working with the german police at ports , airports and in trains and serve as liaison officers in the national information and cooperation center , the security headquarters for the world cup , which is based in berlin . " in england we 've been working very closely with our german government colleagues and our police colleagues for the past two years , " said steve thomas from the manchester police force and one of the cops helping out with the world cup .
" i was at the european championships 2004 and in the last four years i 've traveled europe for championship games and uefa cup games , and i can say without doubt that the level of cooperation is absolutely second to none , " thomas said .
" everything is being taken care of , everything is being planned for . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the worst-case scenario last week , for example , britain banned more than 3,000 known english hooligans from traveling to germany .
however , more than 300 of them have refused to hand in their passports to the authorities .
the british interior ministry has voiced fears that some of them may have already entered germany . nato surveillance planes take off in addition to the foreign hands helping out at the world cup , germany 's military will also be pitching in with around 7,000 soldiers .
they will be chiefly involved in possible air rescue operations and detecting radioactive materials if necessary . in addition , nato surveillance planes will monitor german airspace starting wednesday and will continue to do so until the tournament ends on july 9 . the last soccer world cup played in europe - in 1998 in france - was marred by violent hooligans who left a french policeman severely disabled . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup security , safety gets thumbs up from fifa the ninth european police congress featuring 1300 police officials from 65 countries opened in berlin tuesday with delegates focusing on security issues surrounding the world cup being held in germany this summer .

she said wednesday that reconciliation between german jews and newcomers was a priority for her tenure .

" racist attacks are a reality in germany , " the africa council , a group for expatriates , said in a statement posted on the internet in which it warned visitors to be particularly careful in the former communist east . " the likelihood of falling victim to racist attack is considerably higher in east germany and parts of east berlin than in west germany ... we therefore urge visitors to be especially careful , " the group said . it released the controversial guidelines in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany . their advice includes carrying a mobile phone whenever possible , traveling in groups if possible , and directions on how to deal with the police or to ask bystanders for help in case of attack . some members of the africa council , an umbrella group of immigrant associations , later distanced themselves from the guidelines .
these were released in cooperation with the international league for human rights in the wake of a string of apparently race-related violent attacks in germany .
heated debate the africa council has in recent weeks contributed to a heated debate about whether germany was a facing an upsurge in racism , particularly in the east of the country , and how this could effect its hard-won reputation for tolerance as it hosts the world cup .

police officers from 13 nations have arrived in the country to help identify and rein in potential troublemakers . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble on tuesday welcomed a group of 300 police officers from 13 countries to help german authorities boost security during the four-week tournament . " we are now very well prepared at all levels of security .
this includes germany 's municipalities , regions and the nation as a whole , but also as far as cooperation with international authorities and police is concerned , " schäuble said .
" although you can never guarantee 100 percent security , i 'm convinced people will feel safe here and enjoy a happy world cup , " he added . schäuble said the foreign police officers would be given wide-ranging powers - they will check the identification of people , ban troublemakers from stadiums and other places as well as detain violent fans . german authorities believe that the wide availability of cheap beer and the fact that germany is served by low-budget flights from all over europe make the 2006 world cup a potentially high-risk event .
they admit that , right now , they are more worried about soccer hooligans than they are about al qaeda .
german police have been busy for some time amassing intelligence from around the world to prevent known hooligans from entering the country .
new worries traditionally , trouble from hooligans has come from english , dutch and german fans .
but recent reports from poland suggest that a radical hooligan fringe is on the rise there .
authorities in germany consider it a worrying development since poland is one of germany 's neighbors and the two nations have been drawn to play each other in the first round . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap beer and enthusiastic fans could prove a dangerous combination german security experts believe that the risk of violence is high for about a third of the 64 matches to be played in 12 cities .
police estimate that around 10,000 soccer fans are prone to violence . another area of concern is the more than 200 so-called public viewing sites across the country .
this is where fans without tickets can watch matches on giant video screens .
these potential flashpoints will be prime sites for the deployment of the international police officers in germany . close cooperation with britain german security authorities have been working especially closely with british police who have sent 79 officers .
they will be working with the german police at ports , airports and in trains and serve as liaison officers in the national information and cooperation center , the security headquarters for the world cup , which is based in berlin . " in england we 've been working very closely with our german government colleagues and our police colleagues for the past two years , " said steve thomas from the manchester police force and one of the cops helping out with the world cup .
" i was at the european championships 2004 and in the last four years i 've traveled europe for championship games and uefa cup games , and i can say without doubt that the level of cooperation is absolutely second to none , " thomas said .
" everything is being taken care of , everything is being planned for . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the worst-case scenario last week , for example , britain banned more than 3,000 known english hooligans from traveling to germany .
however , more than 300 of them have refused to hand in their passports to the authorities .
the british interior ministry has voiced fears that some of them may have already entered germany . nato surveillance planes take off in addition to the foreign hands helping out at the world cup , germany 's military will also be pitching in with around 7,000 soldiers .
they will be chiefly involved in possible air rescue operations and detecting radioactive materials if necessary . in addition , nato surveillance planes will monitor german airspace starting wednesday and will continue to do so until the tournament ends on july 9 . the last soccer world cup played in europe - in 1998 in france - was marred by violent hooligans who left a french policeman severely disabled . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup security , safety gets thumbs up from fifa the ninth european police congress featuring 1300 police officials from 65 countries opened in berlin tuesday with delegates focusing on security issues surrounding the world cup being held in germany this summer .

the layers are in so-called kimmeridgian rock of the late jurassic period , which makes them between 150 and 155 million years old . the creatures have body lengths ranging from 1.7 to 6.2 meters -lrb- 10.5-20 feet -rrb- , which seemed so preposterously small for sauropods that the team initially thought the specimens were juveniles . " holger 's reptile from europe " but a closer look at the skulls and isolated bones showed that they were in fact dwarfed adults . the species has been named europasaurus holgeri , or " holger 's reptile from europe , " in honor of holger luedtke , a self-taught paleontologist who found the first bones in 1998 . if e. holgeri were alive today , it would stand shoulder-high to an adult human , and its young would be about the size of a german shepherd dog . at the time when the little dinosaurs were alive , central europe was submerged by sea .
the theory is that they lived on one of the large islands around the lower saxony basin . " such islands would not have been able to support large-bodied sauropods , " says the study , which appears in nature , the weekly british science journal .

she replaces paul spiegel , who ran the council since 2000 and who died of cancer in april at 68 . knobloch , who has served as council vice president since 1996 , was considered a shoo-in for the job .
she said wednesday that reconciliation between german jews and newcomers was a priority for her tenure . " the main focus of my work as president will be to promote the integration of immigrants from the former soviet union and the fight against growing anti-semitism , right-wing extremism and xenophobia , " she told reporters . she added that jews here now saw themselves as full-fledged members of german society " even if we are still far from a normal situation . " chancellor angela merkel hailed knobloch 's " active and tireless engagement " for the jewish community in europe and said the close cooperation between the government and the council would continue . the central council of jews is the main organization representing germany 's jewish community of about 100,000 .
on wednesday , dieter graumann , a 54-year-old financial expert from frankfurt , was elected vice-president to replace knobloch .

he later became its president . in 1951 , she married samuel knobloch , a survivor of the krakow ghetto .
she had originally wanted to emigrate to the us but changed her mind after the birth of her first child and the professional success of her husband . decades later , after her three children finished school , knobloch became active in munich 's jewish community , attacking a surge in far-right violence after national reunification in 1990 and what she called " the new anti-semitism . " in 1985 , she became president of the israeli cultural society of munich and upper bavaria .
during her tenure , she spearheaded a new complex to serve munich 's 9,000 jews .
when completed in 2007 , it will consist of a new main synagogue , a community center and a museum . knobloch has also served since 2003 as vice president for the european jewish congress and since 2005 , the world jewish congress . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's jewish community begins search for new president as mourning continues for the late president of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , debate about who is best suited to fully integrate germany 's 90,000 jewish migrants from eastern europe has begun .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.06.2006 european governments aided in cia abductions , says report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flight data obtained by investigators confirm secret flights a new report released wednesday by europe 's top human rights body provides more details about european aid to the us in transporting terrorism suspects and the existence of secret prisons in eastern europe . some countries provided staging help with extraordinary rendition , in which the cia secretly flew terror suspects through europe to countries where they could have been tortured .
others passed on information about their citizens .
and two are said to have hosted " black sites , " or secret prisons for terrorism suspects . according to a report by council of europe investigator dick marty , a swiss lawmaker , released wednesday , 14 european governments collaborated with the us in the transport of terror suspects in " a spider 's web " crisscrossing europe to third countries , some of which practice torture . an advance copy of the report released to news media also said that romania and poland - the former a candidate for eu membership and the latter an eu member - hosted secret prisons for terror suspects .
both countries have denied the accusations . marty concluded that the us practices were based on an " utterly alien " legal approach which violated human rights law .
he also accused the us of trying to " develop new legal concepts " when " neither conventional judicial instruments nor those established under the framework of the laws of war could effectively counter the new forms of international terrorism . " did n't want to know since the allegations of secret flights and prisons first emerged late last year , most european governments have either denied or played down their roles .
some , including germany , sweden and italy , have launched investigations into the activities of their governments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marty calls us actions illegal under international human rights law but instead of such flights occurring without the knowledge of european governments , they happened with " the intentional or grossly negligent collusion of the european partners , " marty wrote . " whilst hard evidence , at least according to the strict meaning of the word , is still not forthcoming , a number of coherent and converging elements indicate that secret detention centers have indeed existed and unlawful inter-state transfers have taken place in europe , " the report said .
" it is now clear - although we are still far from having established the truth - that authorities in several european countries actively participated with the cia in these unlawful activities .
other countries ignored them knowingly , or did not want to know . " differing degrees of aid the report said that some countries , such as spain , turkey , germany and cyprus , provided " staging posts " for rendition operations , while portugal , ireland , greece and britain were stop-off points for cia flights .
britain allegedly passed on information to the cia about its citizens or residents , who then faced rendition and possibly torture . in one case , the report noted that a former london student , benyam mohammed , was allegedly ill-treated in moroccan custody , where he was taken after his arrest in pakistan .
prisoners had also been allegedly abducted in italy , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina and macedonia , according to the report .
macedonia was accused of covering up its involvement in the rendition of a german national , khaled el-masri , to afghanistan in january 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el-masri 's account of his alleged abduction matches flight data but marty 's most serious charges were said to be against poland and romania , where there was now reportedly enough concrete evidence to support suspicions that the governments there allowed cia secret prisons on their soil . focus on poland marty 's evidence was based on flight plans filed with european air traffic controllers .
thousands of pages of data by eurocontrol , the air traffic agency , showed a " clear pattern " of " rendition circuits , " or specific missions for the transfer of prisoners .
trips were logged not only to romania but from afghanistan to poland .
and some matched accounts by prisoners of their abductions . the report details the cases of 18 terror suspects who were moved around europe .
and in a few cases , flights flew into romania and poland from kabul in what marty wrote could only be drop-off points for prisoners . in the case of poland , eurocontrol detailed a series of flights into szmany air base near warsaw .
marty has accused poland of failing to cooperate ; polish officials have said they have no record of the visit .
" poland can not be considered to be outside the rendition circuits simply because it has failed to furnish information corroborating my data from other source , " the report said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu lawmakers complain of us stonewalling on cia flights european lawmakers visiting washington to probe the alleged illegal detentions and transport of terror suspects in europe by the cia said they were not getting much information from us officials .

the layers are in so-called kimmeridgian rock of the late jurassic period , which makes them between 150 and 155 million years old . the creatures have body lengths ranging from 1.7 to 6.2 meters -lrb- 10.5-20 feet -rrb- , which seemed so preposterously small for sauropods that the team initially thought the specimens were juveniles . " holger 's reptile from europe " but a closer look at the skulls and isolated bones showed that they were in fact dwarfed adults . the species has been named europasaurus holgeri , or " holger 's reptile from europe , " in honor of holger luedtke , a self-taught paleontologist who found the first bones in 1998 . if e. holgeri were alive today , it would stand shoulder-high to an adult human , and its young would be about the size of a german shepherd dog . at the time when the little dinosaurs were alive , central europe was submerged by sea .
the theory is that they lived on one of the large islands around the lower saxony basin . " such islands would not have been able to support large-bodied sauropods , " says the study , which appears in nature , the weekly british science journal . " the ancestor of the europasaurus would have dwarfed rapidly on immigrating to the island , or as a response to shrinking land masses caused by rising sea levels , " the journal said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bronze age sky disc deciphered a group of german scientists has deciphered the meaning of one of the most spectacular archeological discoveries in recent years : the mystery-shrouded sky disc of nebra was used as an advanced astronomical clock .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of pages of archives have been released " when one knows the hunt for eichmann was prolonged because the israelis knew that he was in argentina but did not know the alias under which he was hiding , one understands completely the importance of these documents , " naftali told afp .
" the west germans at the time had the responsibility of arresting or at least transmitting this information and it is they who are the most guilty . " an executor of the " final solution " the israelis kidnapped eichmann , one of the main executors of adolf hitler 's " final solution , " the nazi genocide of jews during world war ii , in buenos aires in 1960 .
he was brought secretly to israel , where he was tried , convicted and hung in 1962 . the cia documents reveal that the united states , at the request of west germany , successfully pressured the us magazine " life , " which had acquired the rights to publish eichmann 's memoir , to delete a reference to globke , naftali said . they also show that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer met with israeli leader david ben-gurion in ny while the german government protected a cabinet minister who was a former nazi " the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " naftali said .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . " shedding new light since 1999 a task force mandated by the us congress has been researching the national archives and documents as they are declassified to shed light on the relations between us authorities and nazi war criminals after world war ii . the group 's work also focuses on us aid given to certain leaders of the japanese regime in power during the 1930s and 1940s . some eight million pages from the cia , fbi and defense department have been studied thus far , according to the national archives .

bank of china , whose shares began to trade on june 1 , said backers of the flotation had taken up an option to sell an additional 3.8 billion shares .
this increases the total amount of money raised to about $ 11.2bn.
bank of china is eyeing up mainland china 's biggest-ever domestic float , hoping to raise 20bn yuan -lrb- $ 2.5bn -rrb- .
china 's second-largest lender has seen its hong kong stock rise 20 % since its shares began trading .

psni analytical director mark evans said in the last six months , there were more than three violent incidents involving knives every day .
a three-week knife amnesty began in northern ireland on 25 may with blades allowed to be dumped at designated bins in civic amenity sites .
police are to put on display some of the weapons recovered so far .
mr evans , who leads a team of 90 advisers to the psni , said the number of murders involving knives during the troubles was relatively low .
" there were lots of people killed as a result of other activity , but since the troubles ended we have seen an increase in the number of knife-related murders , " he said .
" it 's probably twice as bad as it was during the troubles . "
the amnesty is part of a government and police campaign to cut knife crime , especially among boys aged between 11 and 18 .
the northern ireland amnesty is running alongside a similar five-week campaign in other parts of the uk .
psni detective superintendent alan mains said the size of a knife did not matter in terms of its ability to cause serious injury or death .
" to cause a fatal wound can be as little as an inch to two inches of a blade , " he said .
" education is really the main thrust of this campaign ... we have trained 46 community safety involvement officers ... to deliver lessons to 11-18-year-olds - which unfortunately is our target audience . "

a three-week knife amnesty began in northern ireland on 25 may with blades allowed to be dumped at designated bins in civic amenity sites .
police are to put on display some of the weapons recovered so far .
mr evans , who leads a team of 90 advisers to the psni , said the number of murders involving knives during the troubles was relatively low .
" there were lots of people killed as a result of other activity , but since the troubles ended we have seen an increase in the number of knife-related murders , " he said .
" it 's probably twice as bad as it was during the troubles . "
the amnesty is part of a government and police campaign to cut knife crime , especially among boys aged between 11 and 18 .
the northern ireland amnesty is running alongside a similar five-week campaign in other parts of the uk .
psni detective superintendent alan mains said the size of a knife did not matter in terms of its ability to cause serious injury or death .
" to cause a fatal wound can be as little as an inch to two inches of a blade , " he said .
" education is really the main thrust of this campaign ... we have trained 46 community safety involvement officers ... to deliver lessons to 11-18-year-olds - which unfortunately is our target audience . "

of six cities studied by citroen , including london , cardiff jams were worst , with drivers spending more than 30 minutes at a standstill in an hour .
but cardiff drivers were able to cover more miles than londoners in that time .
friends of the earth cymru called for drivers to leave their cars at home to ease congestion and save money .
the citroen survey found that typical cardiff drivers were able to complete 15.7 miles during a one-hour morning commute . "
from a motorist 's point of view it is extremely galling to use petrol and spend money while you are sitting in a traffic jam " automobile association in contrast , london drivers were able to cover only 6.8 miles in an hour but were stationary for just over 19 minutes .
the best commuting conditions were found in edinburgh where drivers were able to cover 17.3 miles in an hour and were stationary for just under 18 minutes .
whether motorists are driving a small or larger vehicle , they will ultimately feel the delays in their wallets , says the aa .
it estimates that a small car loses 1.5p per minute of petrol every time it stops .
this figure rises to 3p per minute in a medium car .
" this means cardiff motorists in medium-sized cars with an hour-long commute are losing about 90p each time they get stuck in congestion , according to these figures , " said the aa .
time stationary in 1 hour commute london : 19m 20s cardiff : 30m 13s norwich : 20m 32s birmingham : 21m 44s manchester : 21m edinburgh : 17m 54s " and assuming there are similar delays on their way home too , that pushes the figure up more than , say , £ 1.50 per day . "
with these estimates , motorists could be losing up to £ 390 per year due to traffic jams , says the aa .
" it is a pretty hefty total and this can only be bad news for the businesses and the economy , " said the spokesman .
miles covered in one-hour commute london : 6.8 cardiff : 15.7 norwich : 15.7 birmingham : 14.8 manchester : 16.2 edinburgh : 17.3 " the only way to alleviate these findings is to find an alternative way to work or find a way of not driving in during the rush-hour .
" but many commuters have no alternative other than using their cars because the public transport system is not sufficient to meet their lifestyle needs .
" from a motorist 's point of view it is extremely galling to use petrol and spend money while you are sitting in a traffic jam . "
friends of the earth cymru say drivers should leave their cars at home to ease congestion , cut costs and improve the city 's environment .
a spokeswoman for the organisation said traffic queues and congestion created an " enormous amount " of climate changing carbon dioxide emissions .
" they also contribute to a poor quality of life , " she said .
cardiff councillor elgan morgan , executive member for environment and transport , said the council was trying to tackle the congestion issue by encouraging people to cycle , walk and use public transport .
new park and ride sites in the city 's suburbs of llanrumney and coryton are being developed and the council was working with cardiff bus to improve routes and reduce bus journey times , he said .
" however , the amount of time spent stationary is perhaps not as significant as the amount of miles people manage to travel in total , which in cardiff 's case is not really different to any other major city outside of london in the survey , " he said .

a third of the housing in the village area , off the donegall road , is officially considered unfit for human habitation .
pensioner tommy turley lives in a one-room property with an outside toilet , no bathroom facilities and no central heating .
he has lived for more than 60 years in the house , which is owned by a private landlord .
while nearby housing executive homes have been modernised , his house has been left to crumble .
mr turley believes the house has never been renovated because the rent is low .
mr turley still has an outdoor toilet " if the landlord had come and done a lot of repairs and said , ' right i have to put your rent up , ' there would be no problem because i was getting paid by the executive .
the executive were paying him directly ... "
" but i could n't understand why he did n't do that . "
like mr turley , those living in squalid conditions are forced to spend days in shopping centres just to keep warm and walk to their local leisure centre for a shower .
one of the main problems is landlords have no obligation to make their properties habitable before they charge rent .
landlords have no obligation to make properties habitable the housing executive has a duty to pay rent on a means-tested basis but it is not required to check whether a property is habitable .
however , it has no power to restrict or refuse to pay rent , even if the property is not fit to live in .
landlords , tenants and homeowners can apply for means-tested grants to improve their homes , but for many people living in deprivation in the village , this is easier said than done .

the report by un secretary general kofi annan says most migrants have gone to rich countries - one in five of them to the us .
in some countries money sent home from abroad accounts for a large proportion of the national income .
mr annan said migration was a now a major feature of international life .
he described his report to the un general assembly as an " early road map for this new era of mobility " .
international migration can be highly beneficial for the development both of the countries they come from and of those where they arrive kofi annan un secretary general his report found there were an estimated 191 million migrants around the world in 2005 .
this compares with 155 million in 1990 .
most migrants moved to wealthy countries , although some 75 million people moved from one developing country to another .
money sent by wire transfers amounts to a high share of national income in the philippines and serbia and montenegro .
' engine of history ' " international migration , supported by the right policies , can be highly beneficial for the development both of the countries they come from and of those where they arrive , " mr annan said .
but , he warned , these benefits " are contingent on the rights of the migrants themselves being respected and upheld " .
mr annan 's report also highlighted the risk of " brain drain " .
an estimated 60 % of the highly educated people of guyana , haiti and jamaica now live abroad .
the report proposes setting up a permanent forum on the issue so governments can compare their different policies .
the report found that europe hosted 34 % of all migrants in 2005 , north america 23 % and asia 28 % , with 9 % in africa , 3 % in latin america and 3 % in oceania .
meanwhile , senior african and european officials have drafted a joint plan to tackle the growing crisis over illegal immigrants making dangerous journeys from africa to enter europe .
their plan , to be formally adopted at a conference on migration in morocco next month , includes tougher preventative measures with aid to encourage young africans to remain in their homelands .

she is far from alone among her fellow citizens , in feeling a little jaundiced at the barrage of world cup-related advertising being churned out by german tv , radio and press in the run-up to the tournament .
still , stuttgart has taken a relatively reserved approach to the global football festival , due to kick off on 9 june , than most other host cities in germany .
in fact , the capital of the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg - with a population of approximately 590,000 and a reputation as a centre of culture - is taking the world cup hype in its stride .
' knowledge-based economy ' that does not mean that the tournament is not important to the city or region , in terms of tourist and commercial opportunities .
it simply means that the world cup has to slot into the existing calendar of summer attractions , which includes a rich diet of art exhibitions , plays and classical concerts .
indeed , the city centre boasts as many posters advertising concerts of wiener klassik music as it does world cup ones . "
we hope the world cup will be a chance to showcase our products " veit haug , stuttgart region economic development director " maybe it is just our understated way , " says veit haug , director of the stuttgart region economic development , who is on a mission to boost the city 's small and medium-sized businesses .
" but we know there will be lots of people coming here for the world cup and that they will be wanting to spend money in stuttgart .
" perhaps our marketing of ourselves and the region in previous times has not been as forceful as it could have been , and we look on the tournament as another important way to get our name across . "
as well as being home to mercedes-benz and porsche , the city and region are leaders in german scientific , academic and research organisations .
" it is a chance to show that we have a strong economy , and that it is a knowledge-based economy , " says mr haug .
" we hope the world cup will be a chance to showcase our products - which we hope will then be bought , and also a chance to encourage people to come and visit again after the football . "
' good trade ' stuttgart is playing host to six games , including the prestigious 3rd / 4th place play-off , and more than 100,000 visitors are expected during the four-week tournament .
beate geier of stuttgart marketing says a sign of the popularity of the forthcoming tournament is that most hotel beds in the city are now taken .
" the whole region is taking people in , and our good public transport systems mean people can come in and out of the city from outlying towns without problems , " she says . "

we hope the world cup will be a chance to showcase our products veit haug , stuttgart region economic development director " maybe it is just our understated way , " says veit haug , director of the stuttgart region economic development , who is on a mission to boost the city 's small and medium-sized businesses .
" but we know there will be lots of people coming here for the world cup and that they will be wanting to spend money in stuttgart .
the world cup stadium is in the shadow of the mercedes museum " perhaps our marketing of ourselves and the region in previous times has not been as forceful as it could have been , and we look on the tournament as another important way to get our name across . "
as well as being home to mercedes-benz and porsche , the city and region are leaders in german scientific , academic and research organisations .
" it is a chance to show that we have a strong economy , and that it is a knowledge-based economy , " says mr haug .
" we hope the world cup will be a chance to showcase our products - which we hope will then be bought , and also a chance to encourage people to come and visit again after the football . "
' good trade ' stuttgart is playing host to six games , including the prestigious 3rd / 4th place play-off , and more than 100,000 visitors are expected during the four-week tournament .
beate geier of stuttgart marketing says a sign of the popularity of the forthcoming tournament is that most hotel beds in the city are now taken .
" the whole region is taking people in , and our good public transport systems mean people can come in and out of the city from outlying towns without problems , " she says .
the world cup gives us a chance to sell the museum and promote the name of mercedes-benz to people from all around the world this summer martin gentischer , mercedes museum in pictures : mercedes opens its museum " the world cup is very important to us , it will mean very good trade for our local shops , restaurants and hotels , and apart from this we do hope the tournament attracts other long-term investment . "
one attraction which does seem set to benefit is the new mercedes-benz museum , situated just across mercedesstrasse from the gottlieb-daimler football stadium .
the company admits it pulled out all the stops to get the museum open on 20 may , three weeks before the 18th world cup gets under way .
stuttgart is playing host to six games this summer martin gentischer , responsible for promoting the futuristic building , says : " one of the aims was to be ready in time for the tournament .
" the world cup gives us a chance to sell the museum and promote the name of mercedes-benz to people from all around the world this summer .
we wanted to make sure we could capitalise on this international opportunity . "
the museum will be open on world cup match days and the hope is that some fans will call in before heading off to support their nation .
australia team base meanwhile , outside stuttgart at the wuerth tools and assembly conglomerate , they have had a visit from " der kaiser " himself : former german world cup-winning manager and player franz beckenbauer .
the firm prides itself on its backing of the arts and sports , and beckenbauer was on hand to open the company 's own wuerth world cup for teams of employees .
" der kaiser " meets workers at the wuerth plant " although we are not involved in sponsoring the world cup , we do own a hotel that the australian football team is staying at during the tournament , " says the firm 's sarah meckel .
the firm is also a partner of the germany-land of ideas initiative , a public-private partnership which aims to showcase leading commercial organisations from the nation during the world cup , both at home and abroad .
" we believe we have good innovative products , and want to strengthen our position in the german market , " says mrs meckel .
' catalyst for stuttgart ' famous german companies as well as co-operation partners from science , culture and society support the " country of ideas " .
they are using the opportunity of the world cup to show the world that , as mrs meckel puts it : " perhaps the economic situation in germany is not as bad as it can sometimes seem . "
meanwhile , back on the streets of stuttgart , the city continues in its low-key way to get ready for the world cup .
however the attention to detail that is being paid on new roads , pavements , signage , and stadium alterations shows how seriously the city is taking things .
" while it is not in our psychology to over-estimate what the tournament can do for us , we really hope the world cup is a catalyst for stuttgart , " says mr haug .

turnover at the company increased by 23 % to £ 1.05bn.
sales have soared in north america with heightened security raising demand for products such as airport scanning and border control devices other products include military sensors and software , banking security systems and desert kits for helicopters .
competition qinetiq said that tight budgets on both sides of the atlantic meant it would have to invest in technology and rationalise to fulfil its potential .
the firm was previously guaranteed government work , but now must compete against rivals for lucrative uk contracts .
the company - which employs more than 11,400 people - has clients ranging from the pentagon to jet engine firm rolls-royce and credit card company barclaycard .
qinetiq 's flotation in february this year , the first by this labour government , attracted criticism because of the amount of money that us investor carlyle group made from the privatisation .
but ministers defended the listing , saying taxpayers were getting value for money .
the company 's shares were launched at 200 pence each , but have recently been trading at about the 175p mark .
they have been underperforming the uk aerospace and defence sector by around 11 percent .
