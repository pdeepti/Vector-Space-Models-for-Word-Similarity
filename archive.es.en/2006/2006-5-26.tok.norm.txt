most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

as the extent of the fiasco became evident , deutsche bahn took a few cost-cutting measures , shortening the glass roof by 131 meters and installing a flat ceiling instead of gerkan 's planned dome .
appalled by what he saw as his client 's lack of vision , the architect took legal action . dw-world.de : what makes the new station so special ? meinhard von gerkan : primarily the fact that it marks the center of germany . it 's a railway interchange station which links east and west in the middle of europe - moreover in berlin 's government district , right on the doorstep of the reichstag and the chancellery .
it 's an ensemble that gives stations an entirely new character .
what sets the architectural structure apart is the fact you 're in a spatial continuum where two tracks that are 25 meters apart actually converge , one of them 15 meters underground , the other ten meters above ground .
then there 's so much space throughout the building .
you can grasp the station 's function both optically and atmospherically and retain your bearings .
it 's the first station of its kind in the world .
it 's also a very striking landmark . the station is opening at the weekend and beginning service on sunday .
are you glad it 's time to hand the building over to the public ? i 'm glad that this very long-winded , 14-year process has come to a provisional end and i hope that remaining imperfections can still be repaired . what aspects of the project are you particularly proud of ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " materialized technology " we 're very pleased that we managed to reach a symbiosis of construction , form and function .
it 's a perfect fusion of construction and architecture that might well be unprecedented .
it is n't a building with a facade and a roof - it 's more seamless .
every single detail is also a constructive factor . its structural elements , which derive from steel construction ; integrated glass and solar plant in the ceiling , make it a piece of materialized technology . do you have a favorite station ? central station in new york is my favorite , because the urban setting is an integral part of the station and the station an integral part of the urban setting . would you do it all again , despite all the difficulties you encountered ? they were n't difficulties , just arbitrary problems and ill will .
you can never foresee that kind of thing .
when you start a project you never know what 's going to happen in the next few years .
i 'd never encountered this sort of difficulty before and i would never assume it 's a standard occurrence .
it has nothing to do with the particular project , its function or the city of berlin . do you expect to reach an agreement with your client , deutsche bahn ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of the line for the gerkan project i imagine that once the station begins operating , the public and the politicians will realize that this issue is a national disgrace - for german architecture , politics and for germany .
and that means that the interest in fixing the problem - which is easy enough - will grow .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .

close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .

" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .
you might be standing at the end of a tunnel , but when the sun shines you can feel it on your face ! " on track , but only just bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the gigantic station in fact , the project has been plagued by problems throughout development , and von gerkan is taking deutsche bahn to court for altering his original plans .
the architect was forced to scale down his plans for an even more ostentatious glass roof and claims the design was changed without his permission . " it 's a very expensive station and it will end up costing more than planned , " said deutsche bahn 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line . " experts say that ultimately , the building might end up costing 10 billion euros if all costs - for rail infrastructure , a road-tunnel , a subway line and even the re-routing of the spree river which lies next to the station - are included . while many believe the station is both visually and conceptually over the top in the cash-strapped capital , others are even wondering what the practical advantages actually are - with the population in western berlin feeling particularly marginalized by the location of berlin 's new " central " station . one protest group managed to collect 112 000 signatures for a petition against the project . but no matter what the critics say , colin hall of the european union 's community of railways and infrastructure companies in brussels says berlin 's new station is more than an eye-catcher . " deutsche bahn has every right , i think , to be proud of their new central station , " he said .
" and to me , it 's a statement of confidence in the rail system .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

" what most surprises me about him is that he has n't got control problems , " maradona said .
" the ball remains on the upper part of his foot , like it is glued to it .
he feels the ball , and that makes him different to the rest . " " he 's also got another gear , a sixth speed .
and the best part of all is that he has n't reached his peak . " as argentina look to messi to light up their challenge , spain could well call upon another talented teenager , cesc fabregas , to provide their midfield with some attacking brio . fabregas : the prince waiting to be crowned king bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cesc fabregas has come of age this season the 19-year-old was one of the stars of arsenal 's run to the final of the champions league this season , and is being tipped to shine in the world cup by former arsenal and england star paul merson . " if he can get in the spain team he could be the main player in the world cup , " said merson .
" he 's that good .
he can be a dark horse and maybe take spain a little bit further than where they 've been before . " fabregas is joined in the spanish ranks by another young starlet , real madrid defender sergio ramos , who became his country 's youngest player in 63 years when he appeared in a friendly against china last year aged 18 . madrid 's ramos eager to live up to huge price tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos makes his living at real madrid ramos , who has only just turned 20 , is the second most expensive teenager in world football last year when he signed from sevilla for 27.7 million euros -lrb- $ 35.2 million -rrb- . until now , the most expensive teenager had been england 's talismanic striker wayne rooney , a snip at 39.3 million euros when manchester united bought him from everton in 2004 .
rooney , still only 20 , has been picked for england 's squad but is a doubtful participant because of a broken foot . yet england 's squad will not be lacking young blood , with the uncapped theo walcott and tottenham 's aaron lennon the surprise choices in sven-goran eriksson 's 23-man party . england not lacking young blood despite rooney doubts while 19-year-old lennon 's inclusion was universally applauded after the spurs winger 's superb form in the premiership , walcott 's selection has divided opinion in england , where it is viewed as either a gamble too far or a stroke of genius . walcott has not even played in england 's top division for his club arsenal , who signed him in january in a deal that could cost up to 17.4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal has hit wayne rooney again eriksson , who has never seen walcott play , admitted that the youngster 's selection is a risk but believes the teenager 's electrifying pace and poise could give england a useful impact weapon from the substitute 's bench , especially if the three lions are lacking their talismanic young star rooney . " walcott is a huge talent and i think he 's mentally ready , " said eriksson . " i do n't think anyone expects him to come on against brazil and score three goals but he deserves to be here . " i do n't think he has any fear - and why should he ?
he was surprised to be picked but he fits in , and he is very quick .

as the extent of the fiasco became evident , deutsche bahn took a few cost-cutting measures , shortening the glass roof by 131 meters and installing a flat ceiling instead of gerkan 's planned dome .
appalled by what he saw as his client 's lack of vision , the architect took legal action . dw-world.de : what makes the new station so special ? meinhard von gerkan : primarily the fact that it marks the center of germany . it 's a railway interchange station which links east and west in the middle of europe - moreover in berlin 's government district , right on the doorstep of the reichstag and the chancellery .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .
you might be standing at the end of a tunnel , but when the sun shines you can feel it on your face ! " on track , but only just bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the gigantic station in fact , the project has been plagued by problems throughout development , and von gerkan is taking deutsche bahn to court for altering his original plans .
the architect was forced to scale down his plans for an even more ostentatious glass roof and claims the design was changed without his permission . " it 's a very expensive station and it will end up costing more than planned , " said deutsche bahn 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line . " experts say that ultimately , the building might end up costing 10 billion euros if all costs - for rail infrastructure , a road-tunnel , a subway line and even the re-routing of the spree river which lies next to the station - are included . while many believe the station is both visually and conceptually over the top in the cash-strapped capital , others are even wondering what the practical advantages actually are - with the population in western berlin feeling particularly marginalized by the location of berlin 's new " central " station . one protest group managed to collect 112 000 signatures for a petition against the project . but no matter what the critics say , colin hall of the european union 's community of railways and infrastructure companies in brussels says berlin 's new station is more than an eye-catcher . " deutsche bahn has every right , i think , to be proud of their new central station , " he said .
" and to me , it 's a statement of confidence in the rail system . " as the world 's eyes turn to berlin for the world cup , deutsche bahn hopes the new station will showcase germany 's best in technology , engineering , infrastructure , efficiency and architecture - and get people to the matches on time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .
you might be standing at the end of a tunnel , but when the sun shines you can feel it on your face ! " on track , but only just bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the gigantic station in fact , the project has been plagued by problems throughout development , and von gerkan is taking deutsche bahn to court for altering his original plans .
the architect was forced to scale down his plans for an even more ostentatious glass roof and claims the design was changed without his permission . " it 's a very expensive station and it will end up costing more than planned , " said deutsche bahn 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line . " experts say that ultimately , the building might end up costing 10 billion euros if all costs - for rail infrastructure , a road-tunnel , a subway line and even the re-routing of the spree river which lies next to the station - are included . while many believe the station is both visually and conceptually over the top in the cash-strapped capital , others are even wondering what the practical advantages actually are - with the population in western berlin feeling particularly marginalized by the location of berlin 's new " central " station . one protest group managed to collect 112 000 signatures for a petition against the project . but no matter what the critics say , colin hall of the european union 's community of railways and infrastructure companies in brussels says berlin 's new station is more than an eye-catcher . " deutsche bahn has every right , i think , to be proud of their new central station , " he said .
" and to me , it 's a statement of confidence in the rail system . " as the world 's eyes turn to berlin for the world cup , deutsche bahn hopes the new station will showcase germany 's best in technology , engineering , infrastructure , efficiency and architecture - and get people to the matches on time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .

most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .
you might be standing at the end of a tunnel , but when the sun shines you can feel it on your face ! " on track , but only just bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the gigantic station in fact , the project has been plagued by problems throughout development , and von gerkan is taking deutsche bahn to court for altering his original plans .
the architect was forced to scale down his plans for an even more ostentatious glass roof and claims the design was changed without his permission . " it 's a very expensive station and it will end up costing more than planned , " said deutsche bahn 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line . " experts say that ultimately , the building might end up costing 10 billion euros if all costs - for rail infrastructure , a road-tunnel , a subway line and even the re-routing of the spree river which lies next to the station - are included . while many believe the station is both visually and conceptually over the top in the cash-strapped capital , others are even wondering what the practical advantages actually are - with the population in western berlin feeling particularly marginalized by the location of berlin 's new " central " station . one protest group managed to collect 112 000 signatures for a petition against the project . but no matter what the critics say , colin hall of the european union 's community of railways and infrastructure companies in brussels says berlin 's new station is more than an eye-catcher . " deutsche bahn has every right , i think , to be proud of their new central station , " he said .
" and to me , it 's a statement of confidence in the rail system . " as the world 's eyes turn to berlin for the world cup , deutsche bahn hopes the new station will showcase germany 's best in technology , engineering , infrastructure , efficiency and architecture - and get people to the matches on time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

as the extent of the fiasco became evident , deutsche bahn took a few cost-cutting measures , shortening the glass roof by 131 meters and installing a flat ceiling instead of gerkan 's planned dome .
appalled by what he saw as his client 's lack of vision , the architect took legal action . dw-world.de : what makes the new station so special ? meinhard von gerkan : primarily the fact that it marks the center of germany . it 's a railway interchange station which links east and west in the middle of europe - moreover in berlin 's government district , right on the doorstep of the reichstag and the chancellery .
it 's an ensemble that gives stations an entirely new character .
what sets the architectural structure apart is the fact you 're in a spatial continuum where two tracks that are 25 meters apart actually converge , one of them 15 meters underground , the other ten meters above ground .
then there 's so much space throughout the building .
you can grasp the station 's function both optically and atmospherically and retain your bearings .
it 's the first station of its kind in the world .
it 's also a very striking landmark . the station is opening at the weekend and beginning service on sunday .
are you glad it 's time to hand the building over to the public ? i 'm glad that this very long-winded , 14-year process has come to a provisional end and i hope that remaining imperfections can still be repaired . what aspects of the project are you particularly proud of ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " materialized technology " we 're very pleased that we managed to reach a symbiosis of construction , form and function .
it 's a perfect fusion of construction and architecture that might well be unprecedented .
it is n't a building with a facade and a roof - it 's more seamless .
every single detail is also a constructive factor . its structural elements , which derive from steel construction ; integrated glass and solar plant in the ceiling , make it a piece of materialized technology . do you have a favorite station ? central station in new york is my favorite , because the urban setting is an integral part of the station and the station an integral part of the urban setting . would you do it all again , despite all the difficulties you encountered ? they were n't difficulties , just arbitrary problems and ill will .
you can never foresee that kind of thing .
when you start a project you never know what 's going to happen in the next few years .
i 'd never encountered this sort of difficulty before and i would never assume it 's a standard occurrence .
it has nothing to do with the particular project , its function or the city of berlin . do you expect to reach an agreement with your client , deutsche bahn ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of the line for the gerkan project i imagine that once the station begins operating , the public and the politicians will realize that this issue is a national disgrace - for german architecture , politics and for germany .
and that means that the interest in fixing the problem - which is easy enough - will grow .
i do believe this should be possible without legal support . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's biggest station to open in berlin in time for world cup chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .

and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .
you might be standing at the end of a tunnel , but when the sun shines you can feel it on your face ! " on track , but only just bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the gigantic station in fact , the project has been plagued by problems throughout development , and von gerkan is taking deutsche bahn to court for altering his original plans .
the architect was forced to scale down his plans for an even more ostentatious glass roof and claims the design was changed without his permission . " it 's a very expensive station and it will end up costing more than planned , " said deutsche bahn 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line . " experts say that ultimately , the building might end up costing 10 billion euros if all costs - for rail infrastructure , a road-tunnel , a subway line and even the re-routing of the spree river which lies next to the station - are included . while many believe the station is both visually and conceptually over the top in the cash-strapped capital , others are even wondering what the practical advantages actually are - with the population in western berlin feeling particularly marginalized by the location of berlin 's new " central " station . one protest group managed to collect 112 000 signatures for a petition against the project . but no matter what the critics say , colin hall of the european union 's community of railways and infrastructure companies in brussels says berlin 's new station is more than an eye-catcher . " deutsche bahn has every right , i think , to be proud of their new central station , " he said .
" and to me , it 's a statement of confidence in the rail system . " as the world 's eyes turn to berlin for the world cup , deutsche bahn hopes the new station will showcase germany 's best in technology , engineering , infrastructure , efficiency and architecture - and get people to the matches on time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .

" what most surprises me about him is that he has n't got control problems , " maradona said .
" the ball remains on the upper part of his foot , like it is glued to it .
he feels the ball , and that makes him different to the rest . " " he 's also got another gear , a sixth speed .
and the best part of all is that he has n't reached his peak . " as argentina look to messi to light up their challenge , spain could well call upon another talented teenager , cesc fabregas , to provide their midfield with some attacking brio . fabregas : the prince waiting to be crowned king bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cesc fabregas has come of age this season the 19-year-old was one of the stars of arsenal 's run to the final of the champions league this season , and is being tipped to shine in the world cup by former arsenal and england star paul merson . " if he can get in the spain team he could be the main player in the world cup , " said merson .
" he 's that good .
he can be a dark horse and maybe take spain a little bit further than where they 've been before . " fabregas is joined in the spanish ranks by another young starlet , real madrid defender sergio ramos , who became his country 's youngest player in 63 years when he appeared in a friendly against china last year aged 18 . madrid 's ramos eager to live up to huge price tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos makes his living at real madrid ramos , who has only just turned 20 , is the second most expensive teenager in world football last year when he signed from sevilla for 27.7 million euros -lrb- $ 35.2 million -rrb- . until now , the most expensive teenager had been england 's talismanic striker wayne rooney , a snip at 39.3 million euros when manchester united bought him from everton in 2004 .
rooney , still only 20 , has been picked for england 's squad but is a doubtful participant because of a broken foot . yet england 's squad will not be lacking young blood , with the uncapped theo walcott and tottenham 's aaron lennon the surprise choices in sven-goran eriksson 's 23-man party . england not lacking young blood despite rooney doubts while 19-year-old lennon 's inclusion was universally applauded after the spurs winger 's superb form in the premiership , walcott 's selection has divided opinion in england , where it is viewed as either a gamble too far or a stroke of genius . walcott has not even played in england 's top division for his club arsenal , who signed him in january in a deal that could cost up to 17.4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal has hit wayne rooney again eriksson , who has never seen walcott play , admitted that the youngster 's selection is a risk but believes the teenager 's electrifying pace and poise could give england a useful impact weapon from the substitute 's bench , especially if the three lions are lacking their talismanic young star rooney . " walcott is a huge talent and i think he 's mentally ready , " said eriksson . " i do n't think anyone expects him to come on against brazil and score three goals but he deserves to be here . " i do n't think he has any fear - and why should he ?

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination .

yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .
you might be standing at the end of a tunnel , but when the sun shines you can feel it on your face ! " on track , but only just bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the gigantic station in fact , the project has been plagued by problems throughout development , and von gerkan is taking deutsche bahn to court for altering his original plans .
the architect was forced to scale down his plans for an even more ostentatious glass roof and claims the design was changed without his permission . " it 's a very expensive station and it will end up costing more than planned , " said deutsche bahn 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line . " experts say that ultimately , the building might end up costing 10 billion euros if all costs - for rail infrastructure , a road-tunnel , a subway line and even the re-routing of the spree river which lies next to the station - are included . while many believe the station is both visually and conceptually over the top in the cash-strapped capital , others are even wondering what the practical advantages actually are - with the population in western berlin feeling particularly marginalized by the location of berlin 's new " central " station . one protest group managed to collect 112 000 signatures for a petition against the project . but no matter what the critics say , colin hall of the european union 's community of railways and infrastructure companies in brussels says berlin 's new station is more than an eye-catcher . " deutsche bahn has every right , i think , to be proud of their new central station , " he said .
" and to me , it 's a statement of confidence in the rail system . " as the world 's eyes turn to berlin for the world cup , deutsche bahn hopes the new station will showcase germany 's best in technology , engineering , infrastructure , efficiency and architecture - and get people to the matches on time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .

" what most surprises me about him is that he has n't got control problems , " maradona said .
" the ball remains on the upper part of his foot , like it is glued to it .
he feels the ball , and that makes him different to the rest . " " he 's also got another gear , a sixth speed .
and the best part of all is that he has n't reached his peak . " as argentina look to messi to light up their challenge , spain could well call upon another talented teenager , cesc fabregas , to provide their midfield with some attacking brio . fabregas : the prince waiting to be crowned king bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cesc fabregas has come of age this season the 19-year-old was one of the stars of arsenal 's run to the final of the champions league this season , and is being tipped to shine in the world cup by former arsenal and england star paul merson . " if he can get in the spain team he could be the main player in the world cup , " said merson .
" he 's that good .
he can be a dark horse and maybe take spain a little bit further than where they 've been before . " fabregas is joined in the spanish ranks by another young starlet , real madrid defender sergio ramos , who became his country 's youngest player in 63 years when he appeared in a friendly against china last year aged 18 . madrid 's ramos eager to live up to huge price tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos makes his living at real madrid ramos , who has only just turned 20 , is the second most expensive teenager in world football last year when he signed from sevilla for 27.7 million euros -lrb- $ 35.2 million -rrb- . until now , the most expensive teenager had been england 's talismanic striker wayne rooney , a snip at 39.3 million euros when manchester united bought him from everton in 2004 .
rooney , still only 20 , has been picked for england 's squad but is a doubtful participant because of a broken foot . yet england 's squad will not be lacking young blood , with the uncapped theo walcott and tottenham 's aaron lennon the surprise choices in sven-goran eriksson 's 23-man party . england not lacking young blood despite rooney doubts while 19-year-old lennon 's inclusion was universally applauded after the spurs winger 's superb form in the premiership , walcott 's selection has divided opinion in england , where it is viewed as either a gamble too far or a stroke of genius . walcott has not even played in england 's top division for his club arsenal , who signed him in january in a deal that could cost up to 17.4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal has hit wayne rooney again eriksson , who has never seen walcott play , admitted that the youngster 's selection is a risk but believes the teenager 's electrifying pace and poise could give england a useful impact weapon from the substitute 's bench , especially if the three lions are lacking their talismanic young star rooney . " walcott is a huge talent and i think he 's mentally ready , " said eriksson . " i do n't think anyone expects him to come on against brazil and score three goals but he deserves to be here . " i do n't think he has any fear - and why should he ?

" what most surprises me about him is that he has n't got control problems , " maradona said .
" the ball remains on the upper part of his foot , like it is glued to it .
he feels the ball , and that makes him different to the rest . " " he 's also got another gear , a sixth speed .
and the best part of all is that he has n't reached his peak . " as argentina look to messi to light up their challenge , spain could well call upon another talented teenager , cesc fabregas , to provide their midfield with some attacking brio . fabregas : the prince waiting to be crowned king bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cesc fabregas has come of age this season the 19-year-old was one of the stars of arsenal 's run to the final of the champions league this season , and is being tipped to shine in the world cup by former arsenal and england star paul merson . " if he can get in the spain team he could be the main player in the world cup , " said merson .
" he 's that good .
he can be a dark horse and maybe take spain a little bit further than where they 've been before . " fabregas is joined in the spanish ranks by another young starlet , real madrid defender sergio ramos , who became his country 's youngest player in 63 years when he appeared in a friendly against china last year aged 18 . madrid 's ramos eager to live up to huge price tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos makes his living at real madrid ramos , who has only just turned 20 , is the second most expensive teenager in world football last year when he signed from sevilla for 27.7 million euros -lrb- $ 35.2 million -rrb- . until now , the most expensive teenager had been england 's talismanic striker wayne rooney , a snip at 39.3 million euros when manchester united bought him from everton in 2004 .
rooney , still only 20 , has been picked for england 's squad but is a doubtful participant because of a broken foot . yet england 's squad will not be lacking young blood , with the uncapped theo walcott and tottenham 's aaron lennon the surprise choices in sven-goran eriksson 's 23-man party . england not lacking young blood despite rooney doubts while 19-year-old lennon 's inclusion was universally applauded after the spurs winger 's superb form in the premiership , walcott 's selection has divided opinion in england , where it is viewed as either a gamble too far or a stroke of genius . walcott has not even played in england 's top division for his club arsenal , who signed him in january in a deal that could cost up to 17.4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal has hit wayne rooney again eriksson , who has never seen walcott play , admitted that the youngster 's selection is a risk but believes the teenager 's electrifying pace and poise could give england a useful impact weapon from the substitute 's bench , especially if the three lions are lacking their talismanic young star rooney . " walcott is a huge talent and i think he 's mentally ready , " said eriksson . " i do n't think anyone expects him to come on against brazil and score three goals but he deserves to be here . " i do n't think he has any fear - and why should he ?

most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .

" arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .
the düsseldorf-based company made no comment about the newest developments . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mittal plans global steel domination mittal steel seeks to consolidate its dominant position as the world 's biggest steel producer by launching a hostile 18.6-billion-euro takeover bid for european group arcelor .

as the extent of the fiasco became evident , deutsche bahn took a few cost-cutting measures , shortening the glass roof by 131 meters and installing a flat ceiling instead of gerkan 's planned dome .
appalled by what he saw as his client 's lack of vision , the architect took legal action . dw-world.de : what makes the new station so special ? meinhard von gerkan : primarily the fact that it marks the center of germany . it 's a railway interchange station which links east and west in the middle of europe - moreover in berlin 's government district , right on the doorstep of the reichstag and the chancellery .
it 's an ensemble that gives stations an entirely new character .
what sets the architectural structure apart is the fact you 're in a spatial continuum where two tracks that are 25 meters apart actually converge , one of them 15 meters underground , the other ten meters above ground .
then there 's so much space throughout the building .
you can grasp the station 's function both optically and atmospherically and retain your bearings .
it 's the first station of its kind in the world .
it 's also a very striking landmark . the station is opening at the weekend and beginning service on sunday .

as the extent of the fiasco became evident , deutsche bahn took a few cost-cutting measures , shortening the glass roof by 131 meters and installing a flat ceiling instead of gerkan 's planned dome .
appalled by what he saw as his client 's lack of vision , the architect took legal action . dw-world.de : what makes the new station so special ? meinhard von gerkan : primarily the fact that it marks the center of germany . it 's a railway interchange station which links east and west in the middle of europe - moreover in berlin 's government district , right on the doorstep of the reichstag and the chancellery .
it 's an ensemble that gives stations an entirely new character .
what sets the architectural structure apart is the fact you 're in a spatial continuum where two tracks that are 25 meters apart actually converge , one of them 15 meters underground , the other ten meters above ground .
then there 's so much space throughout the building .
you can grasp the station 's function both optically and atmospherically and retain your bearings .
it 's the first station of its kind in the world .
it 's also a very striking landmark . the station is opening at the weekend and beginning service on sunday .
are you glad it 's time to hand the building over to the public ? i 'm glad that this very long-winded , 14-year process has come to a provisional end and i hope that remaining imperfections can still be repaired . what aspects of the project are you particularly proud of ?

it 's a perfect fusion of construction and architecture that might well be unprecedented .
it is n't a building with a facade and a roof - it 's more seamless .
every single detail is also a constructive factor . its structural elements , which derive from steel construction ; integrated glass and solar plant in the ceiling , make it a piece of materialized technology . do you have a favorite station ? central station in new york is my favorite , because the urban setting is an integral part of the station and the station an integral part of the urban setting . would you do it all again , despite all the difficulties you encountered ? they were n't difficulties , just arbitrary problems and ill will .
you can never foresee that kind of thing .
when you start a project you never know what 's going to happen in the next few years .
i 'd never encountered this sort of difficulty before and i would never assume it 's a standard occurrence .
it has nothing to do with the particular project , its function or the city of berlin . do you expect to reach an agreement with your client , deutsche bahn ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of the line for the gerkan project i imagine that once the station begins operating , the public and the politicians will realize that this issue is a national disgrace - for german architecture , politics and for germany .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .
you might be standing at the end of a tunnel , but when the sun shines you can feel it on your face ! " on track , but only just bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the gigantic station in fact , the project has been plagued by problems throughout development , and von gerkan is taking deutsche bahn to court for altering his original plans .
the architect was forced to scale down his plans for an even more ostentatious glass roof and claims the design was changed without his permission . " it 's a very expensive station and it will end up costing more than planned , " said deutsche bahn 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line . " experts say that ultimately , the building might end up costing 10 billion euros if all costs - for rail infrastructure , a road-tunnel , a subway line and even the re-routing of the spree river which lies next to the station - are included . while many believe the station is both visually and conceptually over the top in the cash-strapped capital , others are even wondering what the practical advantages actually are - with the population in western berlin feeling particularly marginalized by the location of berlin 's new " central " station . one protest group managed to collect 112 000 signatures for a petition against the project . but no matter what the critics say , colin hall of the european union 's community of railways and infrastructure companies in brussels says berlin 's new station is more than an eye-catcher .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .
you might be standing at the end of a tunnel , but when the sun shines you can feel it on your face ! " on track , but only just bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the gigantic station in fact , the project has been plagued by problems throughout development , and von gerkan is taking deutsche bahn to court for altering his original plans .
the architect was forced to scale down his plans for an even more ostentatious glass roof and claims the design was changed without his permission . " it 's a very expensive station and it will end up costing more than planned , " said deutsche bahn 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line . " experts say that ultimately , the building might end up costing 10 billion euros if all costs - for rail infrastructure , a road-tunnel , a subway line and even the re-routing of the spree river which lies next to the station - are included . while many believe the station is both visually and conceptually over the top in the cash-strapped capital , others are even wondering what the practical advantages actually are - with the population in western berlin feeling particularly marginalized by the location of berlin 's new " central " station . one protest group managed to collect 112 000 signatures for a petition against the project . but no matter what the critics say , colin hall of the european union 's community of railways and infrastructure companies in brussels says berlin 's new station is more than an eye-catcher . " deutsche bahn has every right , i think , to be proud of their new central station , " he said .
" and to me , it 's a statement of confidence in the rail system . " as the world 's eyes turn to berlin for the world cup , deutsche bahn hopes the new station will showcase germany 's best in technology , engineering , infrastructure , efficiency and architecture - and get people to the matches on time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .

most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .

most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.05.2006 gerkan : new station a perfect symbiosis of form and function großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect and client fell out over the station 's design as berlin 's new central station opens this weekend , dw-world.de caught up with its , architect meinhard von gerkan , to discuss the controversial project . designed by meinhard von gerkan , the capital 's new hauptbahnhof was expected to cost 400 million euros but ended up swallowing a good 300 million euros more .
as the extent of the fiasco became evident , deutsche bahn took a few cost-cutting measures , shortening the glass roof by 131 meters and installing a flat ceiling instead of gerkan 's planned dome .
appalled by what he saw as his client 's lack of vision , the architect took legal action . dw-world.de : what makes the new station so special ? meinhard von gerkan : primarily the fact that it marks the center of germany . it 's a railway interchange station which links east and west in the middle of europe - moreover in berlin 's government district , right on the doorstep of the reichstag and the chancellery .
it 's an ensemble that gives stations an entirely new character .
what sets the architectural structure apart is the fact you 're in a spatial continuum where two tracks that are 25 meters apart actually converge , one of them 15 meters underground , the other ten meters above ground .
then there 's so much space throughout the building .
you can grasp the station 's function both optically and atmospherically and retain your bearings .
it 's the first station of its kind in the world .
it 's also a very striking landmark . the station is opening at the weekend and beginning service on sunday .
are you glad it 's time to hand the building over to the public ? i 'm glad that this very long-winded , 14-year process has come to a provisional end and i hope that remaining imperfections can still be repaired . what aspects of the project are you particularly proud of ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " materialized technology " we 're very pleased that we managed to reach a symbiosis of construction , form and function .
it 's a perfect fusion of construction and architecture that might well be unprecedented .
it is n't a building with a facade and a roof - it 's more seamless .
every single detail is also a constructive factor . its structural elements , which derive from steel construction ; integrated glass and solar plant in the ceiling , make it a piece of materialized technology . do you have a favorite station ? central station in new york is my favorite , because the urban setting is an integral part of the station and the station an integral part of the urban setting . would you do it all again , despite all the difficulties you encountered ? they were n't difficulties , just arbitrary problems and ill will .
you can never foresee that kind of thing .
when you start a project you never know what 's going to happen in the next few years .
i 'd never encountered this sort of difficulty before and i would never assume it 's a standard occurrence .
it has nothing to do with the particular project , its function or the city of berlin . do you expect to reach an agreement with your client , deutsche bahn ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of the line for the gerkan project i imagine that once the station begins operating , the public and the politicians will realize that this issue is a national disgrace - for german architecture , politics and for germany .
and that means that the interest in fixing the problem - which is easy enough - will grow .
i do believe this should be possible without legal support . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's biggest station to open in berlin in time for world cup chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.05.2006 gerkan : new station a perfect symbiosis of form and function großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect and client fell out over the station 's design as berlin 's new central station opens this weekend , dw-world.de caught up with its , architect meinhard von gerkan , to discuss the controversial project . designed by meinhard von gerkan , the capital 's new hauptbahnhof was expected to cost 400 million euros but ended up swallowing a good 300 million euros more .
as the extent of the fiasco became evident , deutsche bahn took a few cost-cutting measures , shortening the glass roof by 131 meters and installing a flat ceiling instead of gerkan 's planned dome .
appalled by what he saw as his client 's lack of vision , the architect took legal action . dw-world.de : what makes the new station so special ? meinhard von gerkan : primarily the fact that it marks the center of germany . it 's a railway interchange station which links east and west in the middle of europe - moreover in berlin 's government district , right on the doorstep of the reichstag and the chancellery .
it 's an ensemble that gives stations an entirely new character .
what sets the architectural structure apart is the fact you 're in a spatial continuum where two tracks that are 25 meters apart actually converge , one of them 15 meters underground , the other ten meters above ground .
then there 's so much space throughout the building .
you can grasp the station 's function both optically and atmospherically and retain your bearings .
it 's the first station of its kind in the world .
it 's also a very striking landmark . the station is opening at the weekend and beginning service on sunday .
are you glad it 's time to hand the building over to the public ? i 'm glad that this very long-winded , 14-year process has come to a provisional end and i hope that remaining imperfections can still be repaired . what aspects of the project are you particularly proud of ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " materialized technology " we 're very pleased that we managed to reach a symbiosis of construction , form and function .
it 's a perfect fusion of construction and architecture that might well be unprecedented .
it is n't a building with a facade and a roof - it 's more seamless .
every single detail is also a constructive factor . its structural elements , which derive from steel construction ; integrated glass and solar plant in the ceiling , make it a piece of materialized technology . do you have a favorite station ? central station in new york is my favorite , because the urban setting is an integral part of the station and the station an integral part of the urban setting . would you do it all again , despite all the difficulties you encountered ? they were n't difficulties , just arbitrary problems and ill will .
you can never foresee that kind of thing .
when you start a project you never know what 's going to happen in the next few years .
i 'd never encountered this sort of difficulty before and i would never assume it 's a standard occurrence .
it has nothing to do with the particular project , its function or the city of berlin . do you expect to reach an agreement with your client , deutsche bahn ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of the line for the gerkan project i imagine that once the station begins operating , the public and the politicians will realize that this issue is a national disgrace - for german architecture , politics and for germany .
and that means that the interest in fixing the problem - which is easy enough - will grow .
i do believe this should be possible without legal support . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's biggest station to open in berlin in time for world cup chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

as the extent of the fiasco became evident , deutsche bahn took a few cost-cutting measures , shortening the glass roof by 131 meters and installing a flat ceiling instead of gerkan 's planned dome .
appalled by what he saw as his client 's lack of vision , the architect took legal action . dw-world.de : what makes the new station so special ? meinhard von gerkan : primarily the fact that it marks the center of germany . it 's a railway interchange station which links east and west in the middle of europe - moreover in berlin 's government district , right on the doorstep of the reichstag and the chancellery .
it 's an ensemble that gives stations an entirely new character .
what sets the architectural structure apart is the fact you 're in a spatial continuum where two tracks that are 25 meters apart actually converge , one of them 15 meters underground , the other ten meters above ground .
then there 's so much space throughout the building .
you can grasp the station 's function both optically and atmospherically and retain your bearings .
it 's the first station of its kind in the world .
it 's also a very striking landmark . the station is opening at the weekend and beginning service on sunday .
are you glad it 's time to hand the building over to the public ? i 'm glad that this very long-winded , 14-year process has come to a provisional end and i hope that remaining imperfections can still be repaired . what aspects of the project are you particularly proud of ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " materialized technology " we 're very pleased that we managed to reach a symbiosis of construction , form and function .
it 's a perfect fusion of construction and architecture that might well be unprecedented .
it is n't a building with a facade and a roof - it 's more seamless .
every single detail is also a constructive factor . its structural elements , which derive from steel construction ; integrated glass and solar plant in the ceiling , make it a piece of materialized technology . do you have a favorite station ? central station in new york is my favorite , because the urban setting is an integral part of the station and the station an integral part of the urban setting . would you do it all again , despite all the difficulties you encountered ? they were n't difficulties , just arbitrary problems and ill will .
you can never foresee that kind of thing .
when you start a project you never know what 's going to happen in the next few years .
i 'd never encountered this sort of difficulty before and i would never assume it 's a standard occurrence .
it has nothing to do with the particular project , its function or the city of berlin . do you expect to reach an agreement with your client , deutsche bahn ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of the line for the gerkan project i imagine that once the station begins operating , the public and the politicians will realize that this issue is a national disgrace - for german architecture , politics and for germany .
and that means that the interest in fixing the problem - which is easy enough - will grow .
i do believe this should be possible without legal support . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's biggest station to open in berlin in time for world cup chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.05.2006 increasing concern over human trafficking in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup is sparking fears of increasing sexual slavery the modern slave trade is estimated to be worth $ 35 billion a year - the german institute for human rights says only drugs and arms are more lucrative . human trafficking is a problem that , even in 2006 , affects hundreds of thousands of people .
most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .
you might be standing at the end of a tunnel , but when the sun shines you can feel it on your face ! " on track , but only just bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the gigantic station in fact , the project has been plagued by problems throughout development , and von gerkan is taking deutsche bahn to court for altering his original plans .
the architect was forced to scale down his plans for an even more ostentatious glass roof and claims the design was changed without his permission . " it 's a very expensive station and it will end up costing more than planned , " said deutsche bahn 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line . " experts say that ultimately , the building might end up costing 10 billion euros if all costs - for rail infrastructure , a road-tunnel , a subway line and even the re-routing of the spree river which lies next to the station - are included . while many believe the station is both visually and conceptually over the top in the cash-strapped capital , others are even wondering what the practical advantages actually are - with the population in western berlin feeling particularly marginalized by the location of berlin 's new " central " station . one protest group managed to collect 112 000 signatures for a petition against the project . but no matter what the critics say , colin hall of the european union 's community of railways and infrastructure companies in brussels says berlin 's new station is more than an eye-catcher . " deutsche bahn has every right , i think , to be proud of their new central station , " he said .
" and to me , it 's a statement of confidence in the rail system . " as the world 's eyes turn to berlin for the world cup , deutsche bahn hopes the new station will showcase germany 's best in technology , engineering , infrastructure , efficiency and architecture - and get people to the matches on time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .

as the extent of the fiasco became evident , deutsche bahn took a few cost-cutting measures , shortening the glass roof by 131 meters and installing a flat ceiling instead of gerkan 's planned dome .
appalled by what he saw as his client 's lack of vision , the architect took legal action . dw-world.de : what makes the new station so special ? meinhard von gerkan : primarily the fact that it marks the center of germany . it 's a railway interchange station which links east and west in the middle of europe - moreover in berlin 's government district , right on the doorstep of the reichstag and the chancellery .
it 's an ensemble that gives stations an entirely new character .
what sets the architectural structure apart is the fact you 're in a spatial continuum where two tracks that are 25 meters apart actually converge , one of them 15 meters underground , the other ten meters above ground .
then there 's so much space throughout the building .
you can grasp the station 's function both optically and atmospherically and retain your bearings .
it 's the first station of its kind in the world .
it 's also a very striking landmark . the station is opening at the weekend and beginning service on sunday .
are you glad it 's time to hand the building over to the public ? i 'm glad that this very long-winded , 14-year process has come to a provisional end and i hope that remaining imperfections can still be repaired . what aspects of the project are you particularly proud of ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " materialized technology " we 're very pleased that we managed to reach a symbiosis of construction , form and function .
it 's a perfect fusion of construction and architecture that might well be unprecedented .
it is n't a building with a facade and a roof - it 's more seamless .
every single detail is also a constructive factor . its structural elements , which derive from steel construction ; integrated glass and solar plant in the ceiling , make it a piece of materialized technology . do you have a favorite station ? central station in new york is my favorite , because the urban setting is an integral part of the station and the station an integral part of the urban setting . would you do it all again , despite all the difficulties you encountered ? they were n't difficulties , just arbitrary problems and ill will .
you can never foresee that kind of thing .
when you start a project you never know what 's going to happen in the next few years .
i 'd never encountered this sort of difficulty before and i would never assume it 's a standard occurrence .
it has nothing to do with the particular project , its function or the city of berlin . do you expect to reach an agreement with your client , deutsche bahn ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of the line for the gerkan project i imagine that once the station begins operating , the public and the politicians will realize that this issue is a national disgrace - for german architecture , politics and for germany .
and that means that the interest in fixing the problem - which is easy enough - will grow .
i do believe this should be possible without legal support . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's biggest station to open in berlin in time for world cup chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .

most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .
you might be standing at the end of a tunnel , but when the sun shines you can feel it on your face ! " on track , but only just bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the gigantic station in fact , the project has been plagued by problems throughout development , and von gerkan is taking deutsche bahn to court for altering his original plans .
the architect was forced to scale down his plans for an even more ostentatious glass roof and claims the design was changed without his permission . " it 's a very expensive station and it will end up costing more than planned , " said deutsche bahn 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line . " experts say that ultimately , the building might end up costing 10 billion euros if all costs - for rail infrastructure , a road-tunnel , a subway line and even the re-routing of the spree river which lies next to the station - are included . while many believe the station is both visually and conceptually over the top in the cash-strapped capital , others are even wondering what the practical advantages actually are - with the population in western berlin feeling particularly marginalized by the location of berlin 's new " central " station . one protest group managed to collect 112 000 signatures for a petition against the project . but no matter what the critics say , colin hall of the european union 's community of railways and infrastructure companies in brussels says berlin 's new station is more than an eye-catcher . " deutsche bahn has every right , i think , to be proud of their new central station , " he said .
" and to me , it 's a statement of confidence in the rail system . " as the world 's eyes turn to berlin for the world cup , deutsche bahn hopes the new station will showcase germany 's best in technology , engineering , infrastructure , efficiency and architecture - and get people to the matches on time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .
you might be standing at the end of a tunnel , but when the sun shines you can feel it on your face ! " on track , but only just bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the gigantic station in fact , the project has been plagued by problems throughout development , and von gerkan is taking deutsche bahn to court for altering his original plans .
the architect was forced to scale down his plans for an even more ostentatious glass roof and claims the design was changed without his permission . " it 's a very expensive station and it will end up costing more than planned , " said deutsche bahn 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line . " experts say that ultimately , the building might end up costing 10 billion euros if all costs - for rail infrastructure , a road-tunnel , a subway line and even the re-routing of the spree river which lies next to the station - are included . while many believe the station is both visually and conceptually over the top in the cash-strapped capital , others are even wondering what the practical advantages actually are - with the population in western berlin feeling particularly marginalized by the location of berlin 's new " central " station . one protest group managed to collect 112 000 signatures for a petition against the project . but no matter what the critics say , colin hall of the european union 's community of railways and infrastructure companies in brussels says berlin 's new station is more than an eye-catcher . " deutsche bahn has every right , i think , to be proud of their new central station , " he said .
" and to me , it 's a statement of confidence in the rail system . " as the world 's eyes turn to berlin for the world cup , deutsche bahn hopes the new station will showcase germany 's best in technology , engineering , infrastructure , efficiency and architecture - and get people to the matches on time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .

as the extent of the fiasco became evident , deutsche bahn took a few cost-cutting measures , shortening the glass roof by 131 meters and installing a flat ceiling instead of gerkan 's planned dome .
appalled by what he saw as his client 's lack of vision , the architect took legal action . dw-world.de : what makes the new station so special ? meinhard von gerkan : primarily the fact that it marks the center of germany . it 's a railway interchange station which links east and west in the middle of europe - moreover in berlin 's government district , right on the doorstep of the reichstag and the chancellery .
it 's an ensemble that gives stations an entirely new character .
what sets the architectural structure apart is the fact you 're in a spatial continuum where two tracks that are 25 meters apart actually converge , one of them 15 meters underground , the other ten meters above ground .
then there 's so much space throughout the building .
you can grasp the station 's function both optically and atmospherically and retain your bearings .
it 's the first station of its kind in the world .
it 's also a very striking landmark . the station is opening at the weekend and beginning service on sunday .
are you glad it 's time to hand the building over to the public ? i 'm glad that this very long-winded , 14-year process has come to a provisional end and i hope that remaining imperfections can still be repaired . what aspects of the project are you particularly proud of ?

it 's a perfect fusion of construction and architecture that might well be unprecedented .
it is n't a building with a facade and a roof - it 's more seamless .
every single detail is also a constructive factor . its structural elements , which derive from steel construction ; integrated glass and solar plant in the ceiling , make it a piece of materialized technology . do you have a favorite station ? central station in new york is my favorite , because the urban setting is an integral part of the station and the station an integral part of the urban setting . would you do it all again , despite all the difficulties you encountered ? they were n't difficulties , just arbitrary problems and ill will .
you can never foresee that kind of thing .
when you start a project you never know what 's going to happen in the next few years .
i 'd never encountered this sort of difficulty before and i would never assume it 's a standard occurrence .
it has nothing to do with the particular project , its function or the city of berlin . do you expect to reach an agreement with your client , deutsche bahn ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of the line for the gerkan project i imagine that once the station begins operating , the public and the politicians will realize that this issue is a national disgrace - for german architecture , politics and for germany .

most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

as the extent of the fiasco became evident , deutsche bahn took a few cost-cutting measures , shortening the glass roof by 131 meters and installing a flat ceiling instead of gerkan 's planned dome .
appalled by what he saw as his client 's lack of vision , the architect took legal action . dw-world.de : what makes the new station so special ? meinhard von gerkan : primarily the fact that it marks the center of germany . it 's a railway interchange station which links east and west in the middle of europe - moreover in berlin 's government district , right on the doorstep of the reichstag and the chancellery .
it 's an ensemble that gives stations an entirely new character .
what sets the architectural structure apart is the fact you 're in a spatial continuum where two tracks that are 25 meters apart actually converge , one of them 15 meters underground , the other ten meters above ground .
then there 's so much space throughout the building .
you can grasp the station 's function both optically and atmospherically and retain your bearings .
it 's the first station of its kind in the world .
it 's also a very striking landmark . the station is opening at the weekend and beginning service on sunday .

if england captain david beckham does lift the prestigious trophy , just eight percent of bosses plan to let workers have the following day off . " allowing staff to phone in sick just because they have a hangover sets out a precedent which they or their colleagues may seek to exploit long after the final whistle has been blown , " said peter mooney , head of consultancy at elas . world cup absenteeism is expected to be less of a problem this time around , with most matches being played and televised after the normal working day . during the last world cup in japan and south korea in 2002 , english pubs were packed out with shirking office workers swigging booze at breakfast-time due to the time difference . mooney said : " there is no shortage of problems which employers could encounter during the tournament , from absenteeism and low productivity to internal frictions caused when well-meaning patriotism goes too far . " by laying down the rules in advance , employers can play along with the feel-good factor when we win without tying their own hands when it comes to dealing with any issues of misconduct . " dw-world.de forget the title - germany wants an economic boom germany 's influential diw economic research institute released a forecast that the world cup would not significantly aid the country 's economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.05.2006 increasing concern over human trafficking in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup is sparking fears of increasing sexual slavery the modern slave trade is estimated to be worth $ 35 billion a year - the german institute for human rights says only drugs and arms are more lucrative . human trafficking is a problem that , even in 2006 , affects hundreds of thousands of people .
most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .
you might be standing at the end of a tunnel , but when the sun shines you can feel it on your face ! " on track , but only just bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the gigantic station in fact , the project has been plagued by problems throughout development , and von gerkan is taking deutsche bahn to court for altering his original plans .
the architect was forced to scale down his plans for an even more ostentatious glass roof and claims the design was changed without his permission . " it 's a very expensive station and it will end up costing more than planned , " said deutsche bahn 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line . " experts say that ultimately , the building might end up costing 10 billion euros if all costs - for rail infrastructure , a road-tunnel , a subway line and even the re-routing of the spree river which lies next to the station - are included . while many believe the station is both visually and conceptually over the top in the cash-strapped capital , others are even wondering what the practical advantages actually are - with the population in western berlin feeling particularly marginalized by the location of berlin 's new " central " station . one protest group managed to collect 112 000 signatures for a petition against the project . but no matter what the critics say , colin hall of the european union 's community of railways and infrastructure companies in brussels says berlin 's new station is more than an eye-catcher . " deutsche bahn has every right , i think , to be proud of their new central station , " he said .
" and to me , it 's a statement of confidence in the rail system . " as the world 's eyes turn to berlin for the world cup , deutsche bahn hopes the new station will showcase germany 's best in technology , engineering , infrastructure , efficiency and architecture - and get people to the matches on time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.05.2006 increasing concern over human trafficking in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup is sparking fears of increasing sexual slavery the modern slave trade is estimated to be worth $ 35 billion a year - the german institute for human rights says only drugs and arms are more lucrative . human trafficking is a problem that , even in 2006 , affects hundreds of thousands of people .
most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination .

yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

" what most surprises me about him is that he has n't got control problems , " maradona said .
" the ball remains on the upper part of his foot , like it is glued to it .
he feels the ball , and that makes him different to the rest . " " he 's also got another gear , a sixth speed .
and the best part of all is that he has n't reached his peak .

" if he can get in the spain team he could be the main player in the world cup , " said merson .
" he 's that good .
he can be a dark horse and maybe take spain a little bit further than where they 've been before . " fabregas is joined in the spanish ranks by another young starlet , real madrid defender sergio ramos , who became his country 's youngest player in 63 years when he appeared in a friendly against china last year aged 18 . madrid 's ramos eager to live up to huge price tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos makes his living at real madrid ramos , who has only just turned 20 , is the second most expensive teenager in world football last year when he signed from sevilla for 27.7 million euros -lrb- $ 35.2 million -rrb- . until now , the most expensive teenager had been england 's talismanic striker wayne rooney , a snip at 39.3 million euros when manchester united bought him from everton in 2004 .
rooney , still only 20 , has been picked for england 's squad but is a doubtful participant because of a broken foot . yet england 's squad will not be lacking young blood , with the uncapped theo walcott and tottenham 's aaron lennon the surprise choices in sven-goran eriksson 's 23-man party . england not lacking young blood despite rooney doubts while 19-year-old lennon 's inclusion was universally applauded after the spurs winger 's superb form in the premiership , walcott 's selection has divided opinion in england , where it is viewed as either a gamble too far or a stroke of genius . walcott has not even played in england 's top division for his club arsenal , who signed him in january in a deal that could cost up to 17.4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal has hit wayne rooney again eriksson , who has never seen walcott play , admitted that the youngster 's selection is a risk but believes the teenager 's electrifying pace and poise could give england a useful impact weapon from the substitute 's bench , especially if the three lions are lacking their talismanic young star rooney . " walcott is a huge talent and i think he 's mentally ready , " said eriksson . " i do n't think anyone expects him to come on against brazil and score three goals but he deserves to be here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.05.2006 increasing concern over human trafficking in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup is sparking fears of increasing sexual slavery the modern slave trade is estimated to be worth $ 35 billion a year - the german institute for human rights says only drugs and arms are more lucrative . human trafficking is a problem that , even in 2006 , affects hundreds of thousands of people .
most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

" what most surprises me about him is that he has n't got control problems , " maradona said .
" the ball remains on the upper part of his foot , like it is glued to it .
he feels the ball , and that makes him different to the rest . " " he 's also got another gear , a sixth speed .
and the best part of all is that he has n't reached his peak . " as argentina look to messi to light up their challenge , spain could well call upon another talented teenager , cesc fabregas , to provide their midfield with some attacking brio . fabregas : the prince waiting to be crowned king bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cesc fabregas has come of age this season the 19-year-old was one of the stars of arsenal 's run to the final of the champions league this season , and is being tipped to shine in the world cup by former arsenal and england star paul merson . " if he can get in the spain team he could be the main player in the world cup , " said merson .
" he 's that good .
he can be a dark horse and maybe take spain a little bit further than where they 've been before . " fabregas is joined in the spanish ranks by another young starlet , real madrid defender sergio ramos , who became his country 's youngest player in 63 years when he appeared in a friendly against china last year aged 18 . madrid 's ramos eager to live up to huge price tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos makes his living at real madrid ramos , who has only just turned 20 , is the second most expensive teenager in world football last year when he signed from sevilla for 27.7 million euros -lrb- $ 35.2 million -rrb- . until now , the most expensive teenager had been england 's talismanic striker wayne rooney , a snip at 39.3 million euros when manchester united bought him from everton in 2004 .

" walcott is a huge talent and i think he 's mentally ready , " said eriksson . " i do n't think anyone expects him to come on against brazil and score three goals but he deserves to be here .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .
you might be standing at the end of a tunnel , but when the sun shines you can feel it on your face ! " on track , but only just bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of the gigantic station in fact , the project has been plagued by problems throughout development , and von gerkan is taking deutsche bahn to court for altering his original plans .
the architect was forced to scale down his plans for an even more ostentatious glass roof and claims the design was changed without his permission . " it 's a very expensive station and it will end up costing more than planned , " said deutsche bahn 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line . " experts say that ultimately , the building might end up costing 10 billion euros if all costs - for rail infrastructure , a road-tunnel , a subway line and even the re-routing of the spree river which lies next to the station - are included . while many believe the station is both visually and conceptually over the top in the cash-strapped capital , others are even wondering what the practical advantages actually are - with the population in western berlin feeling particularly marginalized by the location of berlin 's new " central " station . one protest group managed to collect 112 000 signatures for a petition against the project . but no matter what the critics say , colin hall of the european union 's community of railways and infrastructure companies in brussels says berlin 's new station is more than an eye-catcher . " deutsche bahn has every right , i think , to be proud of their new central station , " he said .
" and to me , it 's a statement of confidence in the rail system . " as the world 's eyes turn to berlin for the world cup , deutsche bahn hopes the new station will showcase germany 's best in technology , engineering , infrastructure , efficiency and architecture - and get people to the matches on time . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .

as the extent of the fiasco became evident , deutsche bahn took a few cost-cutting measures , shortening the glass roof by 131 meters and installing a flat ceiling instead of gerkan 's planned dome .
appalled by what he saw as his client 's lack of vision , the architect took legal action . dw-world.de : what makes the new station so special ? meinhard von gerkan : primarily the fact that it marks the center of germany . it 's a railway interchange station which links east and west in the middle of europe - moreover in berlin 's government district , right on the doorstep of the reichstag and the chancellery .
it 's an ensemble that gives stations an entirely new character .
what sets the architectural structure apart is the fact you 're in a spatial continuum where two tracks that are 25 meters apart actually converge , one of them 15 meters underground , the other ten meters above ground .
then there 's so much space throughout the building .
you can grasp the station 's function both optically and atmospherically and retain your bearings .
it 's the first station of its kind in the world .
it 's also a very striking landmark . the station is opening at the weekend and beginning service on sunday .
are you glad it 's time to hand the building over to the public ? i 'm glad that this very long-winded , 14-year process has come to a provisional end and i hope that remaining imperfections can still be repaired . what aspects of the project are you particularly proud of ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " materialized technology " we 're very pleased that we managed to reach a symbiosis of construction , form and function .
it 's a perfect fusion of construction and architecture that might well be unprecedented .
it is n't a building with a facade and a roof - it 's more seamless .
every single detail is also a constructive factor . its structural elements , which derive from steel construction ; integrated glass and solar plant in the ceiling , make it a piece of materialized technology . do you have a favorite station ? central station in new york is my favorite , because the urban setting is an integral part of the station and the station an integral part of the urban setting . would you do it all again , despite all the difficulties you encountered ? they were n't difficulties , just arbitrary problems and ill will .
you can never foresee that kind of thing .
when you start a project you never know what 's going to happen in the next few years .
i 'd never encountered this sort of difficulty before and i would never assume it 's a standard occurrence .
it has nothing to do with the particular project , its function or the city of berlin . do you expect to reach an agreement with your client , deutsche bahn ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of the line for the gerkan project i imagine that once the station begins operating , the public and the politicians will realize that this issue is a national disgrace - for german architecture , politics and for germany .
and that means that the interest in fixing the problem - which is easy enough - will grow .

now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

" what most surprises me about him is that he has n't got control problems , " maradona said .
" the ball remains on the upper part of his foot , like it is glued to it .
he feels the ball , and that makes him different to the rest . " " he 's also got another gear , a sixth speed .
and the best part of all is that he has n't reached his peak . " as argentina look to messi to light up their challenge , spain could well call upon another talented teenager , cesc fabregas , to provide their midfield with some attacking brio . fabregas : the prince waiting to be crowned king bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cesc fabregas has come of age this season the 19-year-old was one of the stars of arsenal 's run to the final of the champions league this season , and is being tipped to shine in the world cup by former arsenal and england star paul merson . " if he can get in the spain team he could be the main player in the world cup , " said merson .
" he 's that good .
he can be a dark horse and maybe take spain a little bit further than where they 've been before . " fabregas is joined in the spanish ranks by another young starlet , real madrid defender sergio ramos , who became his country 's youngest player in 63 years when he appeared in a friendly against china last year aged 18 . madrid 's ramos eager to live up to huge price tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos makes his living at real madrid ramos , who has only just turned 20 , is the second most expensive teenager in world football last year when he signed from sevilla for 27.7 million euros -lrb- $ 35.2 million -rrb- . until now , the most expensive teenager had been england 's talismanic striker wayne rooney , a snip at 39.3 million euros when manchester united bought him from everton in 2004 .
rooney , still only 20 , has been picked for england 's squad but is a doubtful participant because of a broken foot . yet england 's squad will not be lacking young blood , with the uncapped theo walcott and tottenham 's aaron lennon the surprise choices in sven-goran eriksson 's 23-man party . england not lacking young blood despite rooney doubts while 19-year-old lennon 's inclusion was universally applauded after the spurs winger 's superb form in the premiership , walcott 's selection has divided opinion in england , where it is viewed as either a gamble too far or a stroke of genius . walcott has not even played in england 's top division for his club arsenal , who signed him in january in a deal that could cost up to 17.4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal has hit wayne rooney again eriksson , who has never seen walcott play , admitted that the youngster 's selection is a risk but believes the teenager 's electrifying pace and poise could give england a useful impact weapon from the substitute 's bench , especially if the three lions are lacking their talismanic young star rooney . " walcott is a huge talent and i think he 's mentally ready , " said eriksson . " i do n't think anyone expects him to come on against brazil and score three goals but he deserves to be here . " i do n't think he has any fear - and why should he ?

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .

chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .
the completion of lehrter bahnhof marks the end of a race against time for construction workers in the german capital . dreamt up in the heady early days of german reunification , berlin 's five-storey steel and glass central railway station is finally opening after a 10 year construction period - and just in time for the world cup . some 1,100 trains and 30,000 passengers will pass through the station every day once business begins on sunday , and it will be where most visitors disembark upon arriving in berlin .
they 're likely to be pretty impressed . according to newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten , " it looks like a giant glass spaceship has landed in the middle of berlin , " while deutsche bahn 's ceo hartmut mehdorn has called it " the most beautiful station in the world . " it certainly is the continent 's largest - and costing some 700 million euros -lrb- $ 892 million -rrb- to build , it 's probably its most expensive , too . but after watching the project develop slowly and often spectacularly over the last few years , the bankrupt german capital does n't seem to be holding the cost against anyone .
half a million people are expected to attend the two-day party marking the grand opening , which will start when chancellor angela merkel rides in on the fastest train from leipzig ever . other highlights of deutsche bahn 's inauguration bonanza include concerts , fireworks , a light-show and two illuminated trains arriving from the east and the west .
and then at 5:27am sunday , the intercity express to hamburg will become the first high-speed train to pull into lehrter bahnhof rather than zoologischer garten , which has served as the reunified city 's central station for the last 16 years . a historic landmark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architecturally ambitious lehrter bahnhof is the first major european rail station built from scratch in nearly a century . " we 're the envy of major cities across the world ! " said deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn .
" berlin 's division during the cold war left us with a massive strip of undeveloped territory along the former berlin wall .
we were lucky to be able to build europe ’ s biggest rail crossing hub right here in the center .
it 's a building for the next century .
it 's going to get us up to speed in many different ways . " it 's a spectacular sight .
close to the historical reichstag and the chancellery , the station 's twin towers and translucent tubular roof made up of 9,117 glass panels rise up above the rest of the capital 's government quarter , cementing post-reunification berlin 's reputation for ambitious architecture . 12 meters above street level , six east-west bound tracks will connect destinations such as paris and moscow .
43 round glass-elevators , 54 escalators and dozens of staircases take travelers down to a three-level shopping plaza , where 82 stores , lounges and restaurants will be providing service around the clock seven days a week . and 15 meters underground , eight north-south lines cross , linking copenhagen to athens through a new 3.6 kilometer tunnel which runs underneath berlin 's city center . german architect meinhard von gerkan calls his new station a " mobility cathedral " and said his biggest challenge was bringing daylight to all levels . " my aim was to allow daylight to shine right down to the ground floor , " he said .
" transparency was everything .

the architect was forced to scale down his plans for an even more ostentatious glass roof and claims the design was changed without his permission . " it 's a very expensive station and it will end up costing more than planned , " said deutsche bahn 's chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
" we wanted a functional station … . and we had to draw the line . " experts say that ultimately , the building might end up costing 10 billion euros if all costs - for rail infrastructure , a road-tunnel , a subway line and even the re-routing of the spree river which lies next to the station - are included . while many believe the station is both visually and conceptually over the top in the cash-strapped capital , others are even wondering what the practical advantages actually are - with the population in western berlin feeling particularly marginalized by the location of berlin 's new " central " station . one protest group managed to collect 112 000 signatures for a petition against the project . but no matter what the critics say , colin hall of the european union 's community of railways and infrastructure companies in brussels says berlin 's new station is more than an eye-catcher .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.05.2006 increasing concern over human trafficking in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup is sparking fears of increasing sexual slavery the modern slave trade is estimated to be worth $ 35 billion a year - the german institute for human rights says only drugs and arms are more lucrative . human trafficking is a problem that , even in 2006 , affects hundreds of thousands of people .
most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

" what most surprises me about him is that he has n't got control problems , " maradona said .
" the ball remains on the upper part of his foot , like it is glued to it .
he feels the ball , and that makes him different to the rest . " " he 's also got another gear , a sixth speed .
and the best part of all is that he has n't reached his peak . " as argentina look to messi to light up their challenge , spain could well call upon another talented teenager , cesc fabregas , to provide their midfield with some attacking brio . fabregas : the prince waiting to be crowned king bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cesc fabregas has come of age this season the 19-year-old was one of the stars of arsenal 's run to the final of the champions league this season , and is being tipped to shine in the world cup by former arsenal and england star paul merson . " if he can get in the spain team he could be the main player in the world cup , " said merson .
" he 's that good .
he can be a dark horse and maybe take spain a little bit further than where they 've been before . " fabregas is joined in the spanish ranks by another young starlet , real madrid defender sergio ramos , who became his country 's youngest player in 63 years when he appeared in a friendly against china last year aged 18 . madrid 's ramos eager to live up to huge price tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos makes his living at real madrid ramos , who has only just turned 20 , is the second most expensive teenager in world football last year when he signed from sevilla for 27.7 million euros -lrb- $ 35.2 million -rrb- . until now , the most expensive teenager had been england 's talismanic striker wayne rooney , a snip at 39.3 million euros when manchester united bought him from everton in 2004 .
rooney , still only 20 , has been picked for england 's squad but is a doubtful participant because of a broken foot . yet england 's squad will not be lacking young blood , with the uncapped theo walcott and tottenham 's aaron lennon the surprise choices in sven-goran eriksson 's 23-man party . england not lacking young blood despite rooney doubts while 19-year-old lennon 's inclusion was universally applauded after the spurs winger 's superb form in the premiership , walcott 's selection has divided opinion in england , where it is viewed as either a gamble too far or a stroke of genius . walcott has not even played in england 's top division for his club arsenal , who signed him in january in a deal that could cost up to 17.4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal has hit wayne rooney again eriksson , who has never seen walcott play , admitted that the youngster 's selection is a risk but believes the teenager 's electrifying pace and poise could give england a useful impact weapon from the substitute 's bench , especially if the three lions are lacking their talismanic young star rooney . " walcott is a huge talent and i think he 's mentally ready , " said eriksson . " i do n't think anyone expects him to come on against brazil and score three goals but he deserves to be here . " i do n't think he has any fear - and why should he ?

" what most surprises me about him is that he has n't got control problems , " maradona said .
" the ball remains on the upper part of his foot , like it is glued to it .
he feels the ball , and that makes him different to the rest . " " he 's also got another gear , a sixth speed .
and the best part of all is that he has n't reached his peak . " as argentina look to messi to light up their challenge , spain could well call upon another talented teenager , cesc fabregas , to provide their midfield with some attacking brio . fabregas : the prince waiting to be crowned king bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cesc fabregas has come of age this season the 19-year-old was one of the stars of arsenal 's run to the final of the champions league this season , and is being tipped to shine in the world cup by former arsenal and england star paul merson . " if he can get in the spain team he could be the main player in the world cup , " said merson .
" he 's that good .
he can be a dark horse and maybe take spain a little bit further than where they 've been before . " fabregas is joined in the spanish ranks by another young starlet , real madrid defender sergio ramos , who became his country 's youngest player in 63 years when he appeared in a friendly against china last year aged 18 . madrid 's ramos eager to live up to huge price tag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramos makes his living at real madrid ramos , who has only just turned 20 , is the second most expensive teenager in world football last year when he signed from sevilla for 27.7 million euros -lrb- $ 35.2 million -rrb- . until now , the most expensive teenager had been england 's talismanic striker wayne rooney , a snip at 39.3 million euros when manchester united bought him from everton in 2004 .
rooney , still only 20 , has been picked for england 's squad but is a doubtful participant because of a broken foot . yet england 's squad will not be lacking young blood , with the uncapped theo walcott and tottenham 's aaron lennon the surprise choices in sven-goran eriksson 's 23-man party . england not lacking young blood despite rooney doubts while 19-year-old lennon 's inclusion was universally applauded after the spurs winger 's superb form in the premiership , walcott 's selection has divided opinion in england , where it is viewed as either a gamble too far or a stroke of genius . walcott has not even played in england 's top division for his club arsenal , who signed him in january in a deal that could cost up to 17.4 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal has hit wayne rooney again eriksson , who has never seen walcott play , admitted that the youngster 's selection is a risk but believes the teenager 's electrifying pace and poise could give england a useful impact weapon from the substitute 's bench , especially if the three lions are lacking their talismanic young star rooney . " walcott is a huge talent and i think he 's mentally ready , " said eriksson . " i do n't think anyone expects him to come on against brazil and score three goals but he deserves to be here . " i do n't think he has any fear - and why should he ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.05.2006 gerkan : new station a perfect symbiosis of form and function großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect and client fell out over the station 's design as berlin 's new central station opens this weekend , dw-world.de caught up with its , architect meinhard von gerkan , to discuss the controversial project . designed by meinhard von gerkan , the capital 's new hauptbahnhof was expected to cost 400 million euros but ended up swallowing a good 300 million euros more .
as the extent of the fiasco became evident , deutsche bahn took a few cost-cutting measures , shortening the glass roof by 131 meters and installing a flat ceiling instead of gerkan 's planned dome .
appalled by what he saw as his client 's lack of vision , the architect took legal action . dw-world.de : what makes the new station so special ? meinhard von gerkan : primarily the fact that it marks the center of germany . it 's a railway interchange station which links east and west in the middle of europe - moreover in berlin 's government district , right on the doorstep of the reichstag and the chancellery .
it 's an ensemble that gives stations an entirely new character .
what sets the architectural structure apart is the fact you 're in a spatial continuum where two tracks that are 25 meters apart actually converge , one of them 15 meters underground , the other ten meters above ground .
then there 's so much space throughout the building .
you can grasp the station 's function both optically and atmospherically and retain your bearings .
it 's the first station of its kind in the world .
it 's also a very striking landmark . the station is opening at the weekend and beginning service on sunday .
are you glad it 's time to hand the building over to the public ? i 'm glad that this very long-winded , 14-year process has come to a provisional end and i hope that remaining imperfections can still be repaired . what aspects of the project are you particularly proud of ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " materialized technology " we 're very pleased that we managed to reach a symbiosis of construction , form and function .
it 's a perfect fusion of construction and architecture that might well be unprecedented .
it is n't a building with a facade and a roof - it 's more seamless .
every single detail is also a constructive factor . its structural elements , which derive from steel construction ; integrated glass and solar plant in the ceiling , make it a piece of materialized technology . do you have a favorite station ? central station in new york is my favorite , because the urban setting is an integral part of the station and the station an integral part of the urban setting . would you do it all again , despite all the difficulties you encountered ? they were n't difficulties , just arbitrary problems and ill will .
you can never foresee that kind of thing .
when you start a project you never know what 's going to happen in the next few years .
i 'd never encountered this sort of difficulty before and i would never assume it 's a standard occurrence .
it has nothing to do with the particular project , its function or the city of berlin . do you expect to reach an agreement with your client , deutsche bahn ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of the line for the gerkan project i imagine that once the station begins operating , the public and the politicians will realize that this issue is a national disgrace - for german architecture , politics and for germany .
and that means that the interest in fixing the problem - which is easy enough - will grow .
i do believe this should be possible without legal support . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's biggest station to open in berlin in time for world cup chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .

rival mittal slammed the plan . arcelor 's board of directors has been staunchly resistant to the hostile takeover by the world 's leading steelmaker mittal steel , looking for just about any way to stop the bid .
now , the luxembourg-based company has found a possible escape by announcing a merger with russian steel group severstal in a 12 billion euro -lrb- $ 15.3 billion -rrb- deal that would create the global leader in steel production . the move , which arcelor chief executive guy dolle called a " friendly fusion , " is the latest in a high-stakes game of poker that has seen money being pushed back-and-forth across the table like it was monopoly cash . if the merger is finalized by its shareholders at the end of july , arcelor-severstal would then be the world 's biggest steel group with a turnover of 46 billion euros , the two companies said in a statement . the proposed fusion , which came just a week after mittal improved its hostile cash and shares deal tender , would offer shareholders a premium of around 20 percent to the mittal bid .
the reaction from netherlands-based mittal was one of anger . arcelor " manipulating " its shareholders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mittal brothers aditya -lrb- l . -rrb- and lakshmi may get the short end off the stick mittal said that arcelor was denying its shareholders a premium and a choice with what it called a " second class " combination . " arcelor 's shareholders are being forced to hand over control of their company , whilst being denied a premium .
yet again the board appears to be manipulating its shareholder base to its own ends , " a mittal spokeswoman said . as much as mittal was infuriated by the potential arcelor-severstal alliance , it is relatively helpless .
the cash needed to put a more attractive offer on the table was n't there . " i think this is a deal breaker for mittal .
it will be very difficult to match this , " said one paris-based analyst . alexei mordashov to hold one-third of new company under the agreement , severstal 's chairman alexei mordashov will pay 1.25 billion euros in cash in exchange for arcelor shares given a value of 44 euros each .
in addition , severstal 's 11.73 billion euros in assets will be handed over to arcelor .
mordashov will then own 32 percent of the new steelmaker .
mordashov has agreed not to increase his share in the company for four years , or to sell any of his stake for the next five years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severstal alexei mordashov will have a one-third stake in the new arcelor mittal had last week offered 25.8 billion euros or 37.74 euros per arcelor share .
should the deal go through in july , arcelor 's stock will have doubled since the war for it started with mittal 's unsolicited bid in january . meanwhile , germany 's largest steel company , thyssenkrupp , must wait and see if it can buy arcelor 's newly-acquired canadian unit dofasco , which would have been possible in the event of a mittal-arcelor merger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.05.2006 gerkan : new station a perfect symbiosis of form and function großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect and client fell out over the station 's design as berlin 's new central station opens this weekend , dw-world.de caught up with its , architect meinhard von gerkan , to discuss the controversial project . designed by meinhard von gerkan , the capital 's new hauptbahnhof was expected to cost 400 million euros but ended up swallowing a good 300 million euros more .
as the extent of the fiasco became evident , deutsche bahn took a few cost-cutting measures , shortening the glass roof by 131 meters and installing a flat ceiling instead of gerkan 's planned dome .
appalled by what he saw as his client 's lack of vision , the architect took legal action . dw-world.de : what makes the new station so special ? meinhard von gerkan : primarily the fact that it marks the center of germany . it 's a railway interchange station which links east and west in the middle of europe - moreover in berlin 's government district , right on the doorstep of the reichstag and the chancellery .
it 's an ensemble that gives stations an entirely new character .
what sets the architectural structure apart is the fact you 're in a spatial continuum where two tracks that are 25 meters apart actually converge , one of them 15 meters underground , the other ten meters above ground .
then there 's so much space throughout the building .
you can grasp the station 's function both optically and atmospherically and retain your bearings .
it 's the first station of its kind in the world .
it 's also a very striking landmark . the station is opening at the weekend and beginning service on sunday .
are you glad it 's time to hand the building over to the public ? i 'm glad that this very long-winded , 14-year process has come to a provisional end and i hope that remaining imperfections can still be repaired . what aspects of the project are you particularly proud of ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " materialized technology " we 're very pleased that we managed to reach a symbiosis of construction , form and function .
it 's a perfect fusion of construction and architecture that might well be unprecedented .
it is n't a building with a facade and a roof - it 's more seamless .
every single detail is also a constructive factor . its structural elements , which derive from steel construction ; integrated glass and solar plant in the ceiling , make it a piece of materialized technology . do you have a favorite station ? central station in new york is my favorite , because the urban setting is an integral part of the station and the station an integral part of the urban setting . would you do it all again , despite all the difficulties you encountered ? they were n't difficulties , just arbitrary problems and ill will .
you can never foresee that kind of thing .
when you start a project you never know what 's going to happen in the next few years .
i 'd never encountered this sort of difficulty before and i would never assume it 's a standard occurrence .
it has nothing to do with the particular project , its function or the city of berlin . do you expect to reach an agreement with your client , deutsche bahn ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of the line for the gerkan project i imagine that once the station begins operating , the public and the politicians will realize that this issue is a national disgrace - for german architecture , politics and for germany .
and that means that the interest in fixing the problem - which is easy enough - will grow .
i do believe this should be possible without legal support . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's biggest station to open in berlin in time for world cup chancellor angela merkel is opening europe 's largest train station in berlin friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.05.2006 increasing concern over human trafficking in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup is sparking fears of increasing sexual slavery the modern slave trade is estimated to be worth $ 35 billion a year - the german institute for human rights says only drugs and arms are more lucrative . human trafficking is a problem that , even in 2006 , affects hundreds of thousands of people .
most victims are made completely dependent on their traffickers , and go on to live in slave-like conditions .
last month the german institute for human rights opened a series of events under the title ‘ slavery today ’ .
it aims to raise awareness about contemporary slavery and its roots , and develop strategies to better protect human rights . helga konrad , a human trafficking expert at the organization for security and co-operation in europe , believes when most people hear the term ‘ human trafficking , ’ they think of forced prostitution .
konrad who was in berlin this week notes that other forms of slavery , like forced labour , exploitation , extortion and forced marriages are often overlooked . “ the core of the human trafficking problem is not just that people are being transported from one country to another against their will , ” she said .
“ the core is the exploitation involved , the slavery aspect .
victims are robbed of their freedom .
they ’ re stuck in a situation they can ’ t escape . ” helga konrad explains that human trafficking isn ’ t new - it ’ s just the victims ’ countries of origin that change from time to time . not just a single crime after the fall of the iron curtain , many modern-day slaves came from eastern europe , where people struggled to come to terms with market economics and globalisation . more recently , social unrest and weak law enforcement led the balkans to become a human-trafficking flash-point . but konrad says it isn ’ t always easy to map the international flow of exploitation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many human rights and women 's organizations are running campaigns against forced prostitution “ every country is affected by human trafficking - either as a source , a transit country , or a destination - or more commonly , a combination of all three , ” she said .
" russia , for example , is a major source of human trafficking for forced prostitution , and a transit country too .
but russia is also a destination for forced labor as well . " human trafficking is not just a single crime .
it ’ s a string of criminal activities that begins with so-called ‘ recruiters ’ who lure victims , often still minors , into leaving home with false promises .
then there are the transporters who smuggle them across borders before delivering them to pimps or slave-masters . konrad says european governments need to intensify international co-operation and act against all three phases of the human trafficking process .
she adds that they also need to do more to help victims , for example , by giving them residence permits and social support after they escape . world cup might increase trafficking already a few countries such as britain , the us and sweden have expressed concern over increased sex slavery during the world cup in germany next month .
us legislators brought up the issue with german officials while british police are warning the estimated 100,000 british fans attending the matches to avoid prostitutes . it is estimated that about three million will attend the world cup .
in germany , where prostitution is legal , it is estimated that about 40,000 women are at risk of forced prostitution because of increased smuggling to meet demand . sam edmonds -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : thai sex workers warned against going to world cup a rights group has warned thai sex workers against going to germany during the world cup , saying they could be subject to " all kinds of abuse , " a report said sunday . -lrb- may 22 , 2006 -rrb- dw-world : us , rights groups blast germany over " world cup brothels " a us lawmaker and rights groups have accused germany of doing little to prevent the exploitation of women during the world cup , with one expert calling berlin an official " pimp " for the event .

" the cabbie said ' do n't be so ridiculous ' - and when i went home to my wife she said i was talking nonsense - so i phoned kew gardens , " he said .
it was then experts said that although they could not confirm this was a first in england , it was unusual .
indeed tony kirkham , head of arboretum at kew gardens in west london , said this could become a more frequent sight as our climate becomes warmer .
scientific evidence currently predicts a 2-6c rise in temperature this century and nine of the hottest years on record have occurred in the last decade .
mr kirkham said : " with the weather pattern we have had over the last three years with hot summers and into the autumn . we will start to see more unusual things .
hot summers " we will definitely see more fruit trees planted , more cross pollination and there will be quite a change in the landscape . "
this is reflected in the planting at kew this year where olive , stone pine and cork oak trees , all of which originate from the mediterranean , have been selected .
for every 1c rise in temperature the timing of spring is roughly six days earlier uk phenology network over the last 10 years olive trees have established themselves as a regular feature outside restaurants and cafes .
and mr kirkham believes it will not be long before they begin bearing fruit in this country .
" they need a lot of sun and if they can get through the first winter they should survive , " he says .
" if we have a hot summer that promotes flowers the following year i reckon they could bear fruit eventually .
obvious signs " 10 years ago you never saw any olive trees in this country , except at chelsea flower show where it would have been the star of the show .
" now you can go into any garden centre and they are selling them as the climate is more akin to that of hot countries . "
this case highlights that while climate change will result in us losing some species of plant and wildlife , others will arrive and flourish in the warmer climate .
avocado pear trees originate from central america and mexico with each passing year the onset of spring comes earlier , bringing with it an increase in certain species of birds , butterflies and plants .
according to the uk phenology network , for every 1c rise in temperature the timing of spring is roughly six days earlier .
birds like the little egret are now seen frequently in the south , since their arrival around 20 years ago .
the cetti 's warbler is also now seen in southern wetlands and the nuthatch , serin , lesser blackbacked gull and dartford warbler have started moving northwards too .
but there are the more obvious signs found on our doorstep of which we are becoming increasingly aware .

although some species are clearly benefiting from increased temperatures experts are predicting these " differential responses may disrupt the complex linkages in nature " .
it is also not known how many garden plants or native species may become pests as the british climate becomes more suitable for them .
but the one thing that is clear is the need to act now in order to help the natural world survive and adapt to future change .

it was then experts said that although they could not confirm this was a first in england , it was unusual .
indeed tony kirkham , head of arboretum at kew gardens in west london , said this could become a more frequent sight as our climate becomes warmer .
scientific evidence currently predicts a 2-6c rise in temperature this century and nine of the hottest years on record have occurred in the last decade .
mr kirkham said : " with the weather pattern we have had over the last three years with hot summers and into the autumn . we will start to see more unusual things .
hot summers " we will definitely see more fruit trees planted , more cross pollination and there will be quite a change in the landscape . "
this is reflected in the planting at kew this year where olive , stone pine and cork oak trees , all of which originate from the mediterranean , have been selected .

" they need a lot of sun and if they can get through the first winter they should survive , " he says .
" if we have a hot summer that promotes flowers the following year i reckon they could bear fruit eventually .

this case highlights that while climate change will result in us losing some species of plant and wildlife , others will arrive and flourish in the warmer climate .
avocado pear trees originate from central america and mexico with each passing year the onset of spring comes earlier , bringing with it an increase in certain species of birds , butterflies and plants .
according to the uk phenology network , for every 1c rise in temperature the timing of spring is roughly six days earlier .
birds like the little egret are now seen frequently in the south , since their arrival around 20 years ago .
the cetti 's warbler is also now seen in southern wetlands and the nuthatch , serin , lesser blackbacked gull and dartford warbler have started moving northwards too .

if george bush called you " kenny boy " and just about everyone else you had met in your adult life called you " sir " , you would obviously be shocked and a little outraged at the thought of being locked up .
kenneth lay used to have an overdraft facility of $ 40m -lrb- £ 21m -rrb- .
he lived near the top of an exclusive condominium where there were staff to park the car and bring in the shopping .
the son of a preacher who goes to church every sunday , he is also convinced that god is behind him .
" i firmly believe i 'm innocent of the charges against me , " he said after the verdict .
" we believe that god in fact is in control , and indeed he does work all things for good for those who love the lord . "
" it will be their last free summer for a long time which is indeed a very sobering thought for every boardroom " amanda perry , juror understandably therefore , a small crowd gathered outside houston 's federal court as word got out that there was a verdict .
and there was a real buzz when it emerged that both lay and his former chief executive , jeffrey skilling , were guilty .
" i just wanted to see a little history in the making , " said a student of spanish and psychology at houston university .
" i want to see justice prevail . "
her friend , who studied law , believed he was witnessing something very profound and beautiful .
" i love justice , " said eduardo martinez .
" this is something that feels so good for me . "
it seemed odd to have armed and mounted police around when the criminals were suited , polite and eager to talk .
but this is texas and it was time for a spectacle .
other cops on bicycles added to the sense of theatre .
one block away , audiences have been enjoying a production of agatha christie 's witness for the prosecution - a reminder how gripping a courtroom drama can be , even when the details are complicated .
the enron case was tedious at times but it involved real men who are known to everyone in this town .
they had also , at one time , seduced corporate america , so the stakes were high .
the youngest juror , amanda perry , admitted there had been times when the proceedings had dragged .
" i think some days we wished it would have moved a little quicker , " she said .
but she was full of praise for the prosecution .
" looking back they did an excellent job , " she said , " so that we could understand ken lay and jeffrey skilling will have to make the most of this summer .
" enjoying their homes , families and golf .
it will be their last free summer for a long time which is indeed a very sobering thought for every boardroom . "

but now one east anglian farmer is bringing these animals to the rural setting of the fens .
andy johnson told the bbc that he has only got eight crocodiles at the moment , but in a few years time he could have as many as a thousand .
mr johnson , 36 , of oldhurst , cambridgeshire , is setting up the farm to breed crocodiles for meat .
" it 's white , low fat meat with the grain of fish .
some people say it is similar to chicken , but it 's not , it tastes of crocodile , " he said .
crocodile can be eaten as a meat steak or even spare ribs .
mr johnson said : " crocodile meat is a small market now but i think the demand for alternative meats will grow in the next few years .
it all started off as a bit of a joke , but the more people asked me if i 'd done anything about it the more i looked into it fens crocodile farmer andy johnson " there 's definitely a market for it .
as far as we know we 're the only ones commercially looking at farming the crocodiles in the uk , probably europe . "
the biggest animal on his farm is an 8ft 6in long female called cuddles .
other crocodiles given names include romeo -lrb- the lone male -rrb- , sherbert , kisses , grumpy , smiler and snouty .
" it all started off as a bit of a joke , but the more people asked me if i 'd done anything about it the more i looked into it , " said mr johnson .
" what we were amazed by was how environmentally friendly it is .
we can feed them using farming by products - we use laying hens which would otherwise be sent for incineration .
crocodile meat will be sold in the farm shop " it 's much better than fish farming because fish are fed on krill which are caught using massive nets .
krill is the bottom of the food chain so it 's really bad for the environment .
" we 're looking at ways of using renewable energy including solar power to heat the building . "
huntingdonshire district council said officers had checked mr johnson 's operation and given him permission to proceed .
" we 've given the farm the go-ahead .
our concern is that the animals are properly looked after , that they pose no danger to the public and that there is a proper plan in place if one escapes , " said a council spokesman .
but though mr johnson has a wild animal licence to allow him to keep the crocodiles , he admits he is wary of the animals .
he does not go into the building alone and often employs his wife tracey , 35 , to accompany him inside .
the local council has given mr johnson permission for the farm he said : " with crocodiles it 's very important to be seen by them as top dog , and you do build a relationship up with them .
" but you have to be careful .
crocodiles do n't nip or growl to show they are in a bad mood and have no real way of showing it so you have to be wary .
" there 's no real danger outside of the building though because there 's very few days in this country when it 's warm enough for them .
if they are outside and it is too cold they will get very slow or not move at all . "
they are also planning to open a farm shop , and every saturday he will be allowing visitors to see his crocodiles free of charge .

andy johnson told the bbc that he has only got eight crocodiles at the moment , but in a few years time he could have as many as a thousand .
mr johnson , 36 , of oldhurst , cambridgeshire , is setting up the farm to breed crocodiles for meat .
" it 's white , low fat meat with the grain of fish .
some people say it is similar to chicken , but it 's not , it tastes of crocodile , " he said .
crocodile can be eaten as a meat steak or even spare ribs .

the resources ministry says it is studying a plan to take a 51 % stake in the projects , fanning fears the kremlin is ignoring western business interests .
the proposal has been put forward by russia 's academy of natural science .
in 2004 , moscow effectively renationalised then-oil giant yukos after a forced auction of its assets .
' common sense ' in its report , the academy recommends that the state takes majority control of shell 's sakhalin-2 field , exxon 's sakhalin-1 and the kharyaga licence held by total , because it says they are all behind schedule , over budget and short on russian involvement .
" the russian environmental agency and the natural resources ministry plan to use the academy 's information in future application of control over developing these deposits , " said the resources ministry .
" this is not the ministry 's official position , but there is common sense in what scientists are saying . "
the re-nationalisation of yukos ' assets came after moscow hit the firm with giant back tax demands .
russian authorities subsequently jailed former yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky for nine years on six changes including tax evasion .
many western commentators said mr khodorkovsky - russia 's richest man at the time - was punished for seeking to bankroll pro-western parties .
more recently , moscow has been criticised for its role in a gas dispute with neighbour ukraine .
state-run russian gas giant gazprom cut production to the ukraine in january , causing a knock-on shortage in western europe .
while moscow insisted it was simply a dispute over payments , western commentators accused russia of using gas as a political tool .

the resources ministry says it is studying a plan to take a 51 % stake in the projects , fanning fears the kremlin is ignoring western business interests .
the proposal has been put forward by russia 's academy of natural science .
in 2004 , moscow effectively renationalised then-oil giant yukos after a forced auction of its assets .
' common sense ' in its report , the academy recommends that the state takes majority control of shell 's sakhalin-2 field , exxon 's sakhalin-1 and the kharyaga licence held by total , because it says they are all behind schedule , over budget and short on russian involvement .
" the russian environmental agency and the natural resources ministry plan to use the academy 's information in future application of control over developing these deposits , " said the resources ministry .
" this is not the ministry 's official position , but there is common sense in what scientists are saying . "
the re-nationalisation of yukos ' assets came after moscow hit the firm with giant back tax demands .
russian authorities subsequently jailed former yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky for nine years on six changes including tax evasion .
many western commentators said mr khodorkovsky - russia 's richest man at the time - was punished for seeking to bankroll pro-western parties .
more recently , moscow has been criticised for its role in a gas dispute with neighbour ukraine .
state-run russian gas giant gazprom cut production to the ukraine in january , causing a knock-on shortage in western europe .
while moscow insisted it was simply a dispute over payments , western commentators accused russia of using gas as a political tool .

he has been receiving medical treatment in china , and has also spent time in north korea .
the 83-year-old was a key figure in the country 's political life for more than six decades .
but in his absence the royal family 's role in cambodian politics has declined significantly .
norodom sihanouk has requested there should be no official welcome at phnom penh airport .
but his long-term sparring partner , prime minister hun sen , has arranged for a limousine to meet the former king , and it would be surprising if supporters did not turn out to cheer him into the city .
but sihanouk will find that the political climate is much changed from the time of his departure 10 months ago .
then , the royalist party funcinpec was the coalition partner to hun sen 's cambodian people 's party .
now funcinpec is rudderless .
its leader , prince ranariddh , resigned in the aftermath of a well-engineered scandal , and hun sen has been steadily removing its ministers from office .
it could mark the beginning of the end of the royal family 's involvement in politics .
sihanouk has returned to his other great love - film making .
he was behind the camera once again in north korea .
but he is also keen to ensure the future of the monarchy .
he abdicated in favour of his son norodom sihamoni two years ago , and recently described the prime minister and the king as a buddha-blessed duo .
