they are now facing fines of up to 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,000 -rrb- or prison sentences of up to three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edonkey is not the only piece of software which enables peer-to-peer data sharing " this was the largest action against illegal file-sharing offers on the internet that has ever been carried out in germany , " said public prosecutor jürgen krautkremer . illegal file sharing is usually thought of as the favorite pastime of the younger generation of internet users , but the state-wide , coordinated swoop by the german police reveals a different story . " contrary to popular belief , -lrb- illegal file sharing -rrb- is by no means about young people only , " krautkremer said . people of all ages were found to be engaged in illegal , copyright-violating activities . an internet hunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry feels crippled by internet piracy a couple of months ago , according to krautkremer , investigators started monitoring a server located in the german city of hürth , southwest of cologne .

" no one should be surprised that we are stepping up our campaign in this way , " said john kennedy , chairman and chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- . " internet piracy has hurt the whole music community in germany , with legitimate sales falling by a third in just five years , " he said . according to ifpi , some 400 million copyright infringing music files were downloaded illegally last year in germany .

european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good . the united states is trying to rally its partners behind plans to build a missile shield but many in europe , where some of the network would be based , remain skeptical , defense analysts say . the system , which will consist of 10 antimissile interceptors - rockets designed to shoot down incoming missiles - is scheduled to be ready by 2011 .
it will be integrated into a broader american missile defense system that is designed to protect the us homeland - not europe , per se . iran , deep in conflict with the west over its nuclear program , announced in april that it had tested a new generation of medium-range missile featuring multiple warheads and radar-evading technology . the pentagon says that no decision has been taken yet about where on the old continent the missile defense system might be located . " we expect these consultations will continue in the coming weeks and months with countries that have expressed an interest , " pentagon spokesman bryan whitman told reporters in washington on monday . a difference in perception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a necessity , some as a space wars fantasy some experts suggest the plans have run up against different visions of what constitutes a threat on either side of the atlantic . " there is a difference in perception , " said andrew brookes of the london-based international institute for strategic studies . " america is looking at protection from strategic missile attacks from places like china , north korea and iran .
europe does n't believe that 's a threat . " " europeans , inherently , do n't buy into this fantasy , " brookes said . the plans are the latest chapter in the development of an anti-missile program , initially attempted at great cost under us president ronald reagan during the cold war .
the current system is no longer aimed at russia , rather its aimed at so-called " rogue states " - and is specifically designed to counter a potential nuclear strike from iran . at nato headquarters , officials refused to publicly comment on the us plans . " the us took a political decision to go ahead with the deployment of a missile defense system years ago whereas europe has n't had that discussion , " one nato source said , adding that washington is " forging ahead .

" on the european side , there is an almost categorical refusal to take decisions on the run , " said rik coolsaet of the royal institute of international relations in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us sees iran as a more immediate threat " politically , europeans understand that there is a potential danger from the iranians , but it is not a danger they see likely in the short term .
the sense of urgency is far less present in europe than in the united states , " coolsaet said . another obstacle to accepting the us plan is that it remains to be seen whether such a missile shield can actually work . former head of the pentagon 's office of operational test and evaluation says the interceptors have n't " had a successful intercept test for 4 years . "
but the pentagon has brushed this aside saying the " technical problems " are not " show stoppers .

" i do n't see any evidence that the iranians are producing a weapon that can reach new york , " brookes said .
" i do n't see any evidence that if they had such a weapon , they would even in their wildest dreams contemplate using it given the massive preponderance of retaliatory capability the united states has . " according to brookes , it is more important to focus on current rather than potential threats . " we have to focus on the threat that really matters , and what matters at present is defending troops that might be deployed rather than defending berlin against a perception of a threat , " he said .

european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good . the united states is trying to rally its partners behind plans to build a missile shield but many in europe , where some of the network would be based , remain skeptical , defense analysts say . the system , which will consist of 10 antimissile interceptors - rockets designed to shoot down incoming missiles - is scheduled to be ready by 2011 .
it will be integrated into a broader american missile defense system that is designed to protect the us homeland - not europe , per se . iran , deep in conflict with the west over its nuclear program , announced in april that it had tested a new generation of medium-range missile featuring multiple warheads and radar-evading technology . the pentagon says that no decision has been taken yet about where on the old continent the missile defense system might be located . " we expect these consultations will continue in the coming weeks and months with countries that have expressed an interest , " pentagon spokesman bryan whitman told reporters in washington on monday . a difference in perception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a necessity , some as a space wars fantasy some experts suggest the plans have run up against different visions of what constitutes a threat on either side of the atlantic . " there is a difference in perception , " said andrew brookes of the london-based international institute for strategic studies . " america is looking at protection from strategic missile attacks from places like china , north korea and iran .
europe does n't believe that 's a threat . " " europeans , inherently , do n't buy into this fantasy , " brookes said . the plans are the latest chapter in the development of an anti-missile program , initially attempted at great cost under us president ronald reagan during the cold war .
the current system is no longer aimed at russia , rather its aimed at so-called " rogue states " - and is specifically designed to counter a potential nuclear strike from iran . at nato headquarters , officials refused to publicly comment on the us plans . " the us took a political decision to go ahead with the deployment of a missile defense system years ago whereas europe has n't had that discussion , " one nato source said , adding that washington is " forging ahead .

" there is a growing threat of long-range missile attack on nato territory and it is timely to examine ways and means of addressing that threat , " said marshall billingslea , head of nato 's conference of national armaments directors , announcing that the report had been completed . europe remains cautious europe is , nevertheless , unlikely to act too hastily .

the sense of urgency is far less present in europe than in the united states , " coolsaet said . another obstacle to accepting the us plan is that it remains to be seen whether such a missile shield can actually work . former head of the pentagon 's office of operational test and evaluation says the interceptors have n't " had a successful intercept test for 4 years . "
but the pentagon has brushed this aside saying the " technical problems " are not " show stoppers .

" i do n't see any evidence that the iranians are producing a weapon that can reach new york , " brookes said .
" i do n't see any evidence that if they had such a weapon , they would even in their wildest dreams contemplate using it given the massive preponderance of retaliatory capability the united states has . " according to brookes , it is more important to focus on current rather than potential threats . " we have to focus on the threat that really matters , and what matters at present is defending troops that might be deployed rather than defending berlin against a perception of a threat , " he said .

they are now facing fines of up to 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,000 -rrb- or prison sentences of up to three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edonkey is not the only piece of software which enables peer-to-peer data sharing " this was the largest action against illegal file-sharing offers on the internet that has ever been carried out in germany , " said public prosecutor jürgen krautkremer . illegal file sharing is usually thought of as the favorite pastime of the younger generation of internet users , but the state-wide , coordinated swoop by the german police reveals a different story .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2006 merkel makes human rights a top priority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is respected for her pragmatic manner in addressing sensitive issues in keeping with her consistently outspoken stance on sensitive issues , germany 's chancellor did not mince words on human rights during her visit to china this week .
experts say her style will increase germany 's clout . german chancellor angela merkel is setting a clear course when it comes to human rights . " this is an issue that is being supported from the top and it is significant that this is the case , " said günter nooke , the german government 's human rights representative . he said the differences between merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder were " self-evident . "
schröder , who had a very close relationship to russian president vladimir putin , had called the leader a " flawless democrat . "
merkel , on the other hand , addressed sensitive issues such as chechnya when she went to moscow in january . she also broached the delicate subject of the us prison camp at guantanamo bay before and during her inaugural visit to washington in january . no n eed to schmooze i n chi n a eberhard sandschneider , director of the german council on foreign relations ' research institute , said he was n't surprised that merkel had talked about human rights concerns while in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that at least 8,000 people get the death penalty in china each year " it is n't astonishing , as human rights are always an issue when one of our politicians goes to china , " sandschneider said .
" this sends a signal at home . " but merkel 's course was more positive than schröder 's , sandschneider said . " we finally have someone who recognizes that china does n't need to be schmoozed , " he said .
" rather , a common base needs to be found and we can go from there .
they can handle the criticism . " merkel is a tough but ho n est part n er merkel said at the end of her china visit that the country " still had deficits in human rights . " the chinese are tough negotiators , " merkel told german television zdf .
" so we have to counter just as toughly and make clear that we do n't have anything to give away . " this style of dialogue was by no means detrimental to international ties , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush praised merkel as a " clear thinker " " an interesting partner is someone who has their own opinion , " nooke said .
" the fact that there are differences of opinion does n't make us any less interesting . " merkel 's criticism of human rights issues in beijing , moscow and washington have been positively received on the international stage .
sandschneider said this was because she came across authentically . " she has an honest and straightforward manner and people value this , " sandschneider said . the first step i n a lo n g process human rights organizations have welcomed merkel 's course .
beate wagner from the human rights forum 's -lrb- hrf -rrb- coordination group said there had been a consistent upgrading of human rights under merkel .
the hrf is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . " human rights issues have been explicitly well positioned on her inaugural visits , " said wagner , who is also secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
she said this marked an " improvement " to the schröder government and was a first step . " now , more work needs to be done , " wagner said .
" we 'll have to see how much gets implemented in bilateral relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2006 merkel makes human rights a top priority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is respected for her pragmatic manner in addressing sensitive issues in keeping with her consistently outspoken stance on sensitive issues , germany 's chancellor did not mince words on human rights during her visit to china this week .
experts say her style will increase germany 's clout . german chancellor angela merkel is setting a clear course when it comes to human rights . " this is an issue that is being supported from the top and it is significant that this is the case , " said günter nooke , the german government 's human rights representative . he said the differences between merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder were " self-evident . "
schröder , who had a very close relationship to russian president vladimir putin , had called the leader a " flawless democrat . "
merkel , on the other hand , addressed sensitive issues such as chechnya when she went to moscow in january . she also broached the delicate subject of the us prison camp at guantanamo bay before and during her inaugural visit to washington in january . no n eed to schmooze i n chi n a eberhard sandschneider , director of the german council on foreign relations ' research institute , said he was n't surprised that merkel had talked about human rights concerns while in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that at least 8,000 people get the death penalty in china each year " it is n't astonishing , as human rights are always an issue when one of our politicians goes to china , " sandschneider said .
" this sends a signal at home . " but merkel 's course was more positive than schröder 's , sandschneider said . " we finally have someone who recognizes that china does n't need to be schmoozed , " he said .
" rather , a common base needs to be found and we can go from there .
they can handle the criticism . " merkel is a tough but ho n est part n er merkel said at the end of her china visit that the country " still had deficits in human rights . " the chinese are tough negotiators , " merkel told german television zdf .
" so we have to counter just as toughly and make clear that we do n't have anything to give away . " this style of dialogue was by no means detrimental to international ties , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush praised merkel as a " clear thinker " " an interesting partner is someone who has their own opinion , " nooke said .
" the fact that there are differences of opinion does n't make us any less interesting . " merkel 's criticism of human rights issues in beijing , moscow and washington have been positively received on the international stage .
sandschneider said this was because she came across authentically . " she has an honest and straightforward manner and people value this , " sandschneider said . the first step i n a lo n g process human rights organizations have welcomed merkel 's course .
beate wagner from the human rights forum 's -lrb- hrf -rrb- coordination group said there had been a consistent upgrading of human rights under merkel .
the hrf is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . " human rights issues have been explicitly well positioned on her inaugural visits , " said wagner , who is also secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
she said this marked an " improvement " to the schröder government and was a first step . " now , more work needs to be done , " wagner said .
" we 'll have to see how much gets implemented in bilateral relations .
but we are positively looking forward to see what happens next . " of course , experts agree that merkel 's criticism will not solve problems overnight . " you ca n't have the illusion that one government is going to make a difference , " wagner said .
" but it is part of an international climate , which can exert pressure . " germa n y should use its i n ter n atio n al role i n 2007 in january , germany will take over the six-month rotating presidency of the council of the european union .

experts say her style will increase germany 's clout . german chancellor angela merkel is setting a clear course when it comes to human rights . " this is an issue that is being supported from the top and it is significant that this is the case , " said günter nooke , the german government 's human rights representative . he said the differences between merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder were " self-evident . "
schröder , who had a very close relationship to russian president vladimir putin , had called the leader a " flawless democrat . "
merkel , on the other hand , addressed sensitive issues such as chechnya when she went to moscow in january . she also broached the delicate subject of the us prison camp at guantanamo bay before and during her inaugural visit to washington in january . no n eed to schmooze i n chi n a eberhard sandschneider , director of the german council on foreign relations ' research institute , said he was n't surprised that merkel had talked about human rights concerns while in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that at least 8,000 people get the death penalty in china each year " it is n't astonishing , as human rights are always an issue when one of our politicians goes to china , " sandschneider said .
" this sends a signal at home . " but merkel 's course was more positive than schröder 's , sandschneider said . " we finally have someone who recognizes that china does n't need to be schmoozed , " he said .
" rather , a common base needs to be found and we can go from there .
they can handle the criticism . " merkel is a tough but ho n est part n er merkel said at the end of her china visit that the country " still had deficits in human rights . " the chinese are tough negotiators , " merkel told german television zdf .

" this style of dialogue was by no means detrimental to international ties , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush praised merkel as a " clear thinker " " an interesting partner is someone who has their own opinion , " nooke said .
" the fact that there are differences of opinion does n't make us any less interesting . " merkel 's criticism of human rights issues in beijing , moscow and washington have been positively received on the international stage .
sandschneider said this was because she came across authentically . " she has an honest and straightforward manner and people value this , " sandschneider said . the first step i n a lo n g process human rights organizations have welcomed merkel 's course .
beate wagner from the human rights forum 's -lrb- hrf -rrb- coordination group said there had been a consistent upgrading of human rights under merkel .
the hrf is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . " human rights issues have been explicitly well positioned on her inaugural visits , " said wagner , who is also secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
she said this marked an " improvement " to the schröder government and was a first step . " now , more work needs to be done , " wagner said .
" we 'll have to see how much gets implemented in bilateral relations .
but we are positively looking forward to see what happens next . " of course , experts agree that merkel 's criticism will not solve problems overnight . " you ca n't have the illusion that one government is going to make a difference , " wagner said .

" it is important that europe pull together and carry weight in international bodies , " nooke said .

" it is important that europe pull together and carry weight in international bodies , " nooke said .

the aid will include setting up naval and air patrols . the offer came after autonomous spanish authorities in the canary islands called on madrid and the european union for help . " we can not solve problems overnight , however we are very willing and committed to assist the spanish government in our best possible ways , either with financial means -lrb- or -rrb- operationally , " an eu spokesman said . his comments came as spanish and eu officials held talks in brussels late tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of refugees are estimated to die in sea crossings about 7,500 illegal immigrants have landed in the canaries this year , with some 2,000 africans reaching the islands this month alone .
that compares with 4,751 for the whole of last year , and 8,500 in 2004 . ' a european problem ' the incredible rise in illegal immigrant numbers comes as a result of moves by morocco and spain to block easier migration routes into europe .
now , the migrants leave from the west sahara , mauritania and senegal , often packed into small fishing boats .
spain 's deputy prime minister , maria-teresa fernandez de la vega , said the whole of europe should take responsibility for the problem . “ it ’ s clear that this is not just a problem which affects spain , but one that concerns the whole of europe .
it ’ s a difficult situation , which affects millions of people trying to leave their continent .
we have to approach the migration problem from different angles : cooperation with the refugees ' countries of origin , development aid and regulating the influx to europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa fernandez de la vega initially , frontex , eu 's expert border-control agency in poland , will be sent in to advise spanish border guards .

" we would then have a best overview of the measures requested and we could then obviously devise our own response to this , " he said . looking at africa the problem must also be addressed in africa itself .
in the long-term , the eu says it will work to improve the situation in the refugees ' own countries .
however , this will be a long and arduous process . spain and senegal agreed to work on stemming the flow of immigration on tuesday , but failed to sign a formal repatriation agreement .
the main reason many africans want to leave is due to extreme poverty .
niger ’ s foreign ministry says this is the real problem that must be tackled to stop migration . spanish policy is to deport all migrants who don ’ t meet asylum conditions .

the aid will include setting up naval and air patrols . the offer came after autonomous spanish authorities in the canary islands called on madrid and the european union for help . " we can not solve problems overnight , however we are very willing and committed to assist the spanish government in our best possible ways , either with financial means -lrb- or -rrb- operationally , " an eu spokesman said . his comments came as spanish and eu officials held talks in brussels late tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of refugees are estimated to die in sea crossings about 7,500 illegal immigrants have landed in the canaries this year , with some 2,000 africans reaching the islands this month alone .
that compares with 4,751 for the whole of last year , and 8,500 in 2004 . ' a european problem ' the incredible rise in illegal immigrant numbers comes as a result of moves by morocco and spain to block easier migration routes into europe .
now , the migrants leave from the west sahara , mauritania and senegal , often packed into small fishing boats .
spain 's deputy prime minister , maria-teresa fernandez de la vega , said the whole of europe should take responsibility for the problem . “ it ’ s clear that this is not just a problem which affects spain , but one that concerns the whole of europe .
it ’ s a difficult situation , which affects millions of people trying to leave their continent .
we have to approach the migration problem from different angles : cooperation with the refugees ' countries of origin , development aid and regulating the influx to europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa fernandez de la vega initially , frontex , eu 's expert border-control agency in poland , will be sent in to advise spanish border guards .
they are also to construct a coordination point in the canary islands .

" already eight have come forward who are ready to provide rapid offshore vessels and reconnaissance planes . " pledge from brussels the aim is to locate and detain vessels as they are leaving the african coast .
spain says the eu has also proposed setting up reception centers for immigrants who arrive in the canaries .
brussels has also pledged some 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in aid to madrid to cope with the refugees . spain 's fernandez de la vega was due to hold further talks on the problem with european commission president jose manuel barroso , external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , justice commissioner franco frattini and the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : " after those meetings i think we will have a very good view on what it is the spanish government would like the european union , particularly the commission , to do , " said an eu spokesman . " we would then have a best overview of the measures requested and we could then obviously devise our own response to this , " he said . looking at africa the problem must also be addressed in africa itself .
in the long-term , the eu says it will work to improve the situation in the refugees ' own countries .
however , this will be a long and arduous process . spain and senegal agreed to work on stemming the flow of immigration on tuesday , but failed to sign a formal repatriation agreement .
the main reason many africans want to leave is due to extreme poverty .
niger ’ s foreign ministry says this is the real problem that must be tackled to stop migration . spanish policy is to deport all migrants who don ’ t meet asylum conditions .
however , those with no identification , or from countries that have no deportation accord with madrid , often simply end up moving elsewhere in europe . spain ’ s foreign minister has complained that the bureaucracy of the system means he is constantly required to sign new deportation agreements with african countries .

at the same time , a spate of racist attacks has germany fearing for its hard-won reputation for tolerance . the men were released after a month in police custody on tuesday because they were no longer under " strong suspicion " of beating the ethiopian-born engineer into a coma .
two men had attacked ermyas m. in april in potsdam , outside berlin , and called him a " dirty nigger . "
according to the federal prosecutor 's office , which took over the case after it attracted wide media coverage , the victim does n't remember having been beaten up and ca n't identify the attackers .
the two men remain under investigation , the prosecutor 's office said . federal prosecutor kay nehm has said he believes the attack was motivated by xenophobia . the men 's release from custody made headlines throughout the country in the midst of an impassioned public discussion about xenophobia in germany .
the alarm was sounded last week by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go , " said heye , referring to the state surrounding the capital ..
they might not make it out alive . " heye , now a spokesman for an anti-racism lobby , was not alone in warning of xenophobic pockets in the former communist east , where the country 's neo-nazi party has found a following among unemployed youths . the africa council , a group for expatriates , plans to publish a " no-go-area " brochure listing clubs , bars and restaurants in and around berlin which should give black soccer fans a wide berth . politician attacked but politicians and football authorities said heye 's statement scored an own goal for a country , which has painstakingly confronted its nazi past to earn a reputation for political correctness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sayan was attacked over the weekend over the weekend , the debate took another turn when a german politician of turkish origin was beaten and his head slashed with a broken bottle in lichtenberg , a working class part of berlin known as a neo-nazi stronghold .
the two men who attacked giyasettin sayan , a regional parliamentarian for the neo-communist left party , called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack justified last week 's warnings . the premier of brandenburg , matthias platzeck , on sunday admitted that xenophobia was a problem in the state . " we have to accept that it is not a problem that can be resolved from one day to the next , " he said .
" we have gone through a phase where we minimized and denied the problem , where we said : ' my god , if we speak about this openly we will hurt our image and then nobody will come here ' . " in early january , a 12-year-old boy of ethiopian origin was attacked by a group of neo-nazi youths who forced him at gun-point to lick their boots in the eastern town of magdeburg .
they were jailed this week by a judge who said the color of the victim 's skin was " the sole reason " for the attack .
fear of tarnished image the debate about whether racism is on the rise and the damage it could do has peaked less than three weeks before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , with about one million foreign fans expected to attend the tournament .
the government has been running a campaign to promote germany as an open , friendly society in the hope that those who come will return one day . the leader of the greens , claudia roth , said there was no point in hushing the debate for fear of scaring off foreigners , as recent events spoke for themselves . " it is not talking about the far-right that threatens to harm our reputation but the very facts themselves .
these are not lone incidents , but that we have a widespread , deep-seated problem with right-wing extremist violence in our country . "

interior minister wolfgang schäuble released statistics on monday saying that the number of violent crimes attributed to the far-right had risen by 23 percent in 2005 . wilhelm heitmeyer , a sociologist at the university of bielefeld , blamed the poor state of the economy and the frustration it created for animosity towards foreigners . " it is a german problem , though there is a stronger tendency in the east , " heitmeyer told the news agency afp .

the two men remain under investigation , the prosecutor 's office said . federal prosecutor kay nehm has said he believes the attack was motivated by xenophobia . the men 's release from custody made headlines throughout the country in the midst of an impassioned public discussion about xenophobia in germany .
the alarm was sounded last week by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go , " said heye , referring to the state surrounding the capital ..

the two men who attacked giyasettin sayan , a regional parliamentarian for the neo-communist left party , called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack justified last week 's warnings . the premier of brandenburg , matthias platzeck , on sunday admitted that xenophobia was a problem in the state . " we have to accept that it is not a problem that can be resolved from one day to the next , " he said .

" in early january , a 12-year-old boy of ethiopian origin was attacked by a group of neo-nazi youths who forced him at gun-point to lick their boots in the eastern town of magdeburg .
they were jailed this week by a judge who said the color of the victim 's skin was " the sole reason " for the attack .
fear of tarnished image the debate about whether racism is on the rise and the damage it could do has peaked less than three weeks before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , with about one million foreign fans expected to attend the tournament .
the government has been running a campaign to promote germany as an open , friendly society in the hope that those who come will return one day . the leader of the greens , claudia roth , said there was no point in hushing the debate for fear of scaring off foreigners , as recent events spoke for themselves .

european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good . the united states is trying to rally its partners behind plans to build a missile shield but many in europe , where some of the network would be based , remain skeptical , defense analysts say . the system , which will consist of 10 antimissile interceptors - rockets designed to shoot down incoming missiles - is scheduled to be ready by 2011 .
it will be integrated into a broader american missile defense system that is designed to protect the us homeland - not europe , per se . iran , deep in conflict with the west over its nuclear program , announced in april that it had tested a new generation of medium-range missile featuring multiple warheads and radar-evading technology . the pentagon says that no decision has been taken yet about where on the old continent the missile defense system might be located . " we expect these consultations will continue in the coming weeks and months with countries that have expressed an interest , " pentagon spokesman bryan whitman told reporters in washington on monday . a difference in perception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a necessity , some as a space wars fantasy some experts suggest the plans have run up against different visions of what constitutes a threat on either side of the atlantic . " there is a difference in perception , " said andrew brookes of the london-based international institute for strategic studies . " america is looking at protection from strategic missile attacks from places like china , north korea and iran .
europe does n't believe that 's a threat . " " europeans , inherently , do n't buy into this fantasy , " brookes said . the plans are the latest chapter in the development of an anti-missile program , initially attempted at great cost under us president ronald reagan during the cold war .
the current system is no longer aimed at russia , rather its aimed at so-called " rogue states " - and is specifically designed to counter a potential nuclear strike from iran . at nato headquarters , officials refused to publicly comment on the us plans . " the us took a political decision to go ahead with the deployment of a missile defense system years ago whereas europe has n't had that discussion , " one nato source said , adding that washington is " forging ahead . " possible scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful radar on its way to a us base in alaska the debate may not yet have taken place , but the 26 members of nato have in hand a 10,000-page feasibility study setting out the case for a missile shield and the possible scenarios in which one might be useful . ordered by nato leaders in prague in 2002 , the text has not been discussed at political level yet , but the united states is pushing its allies to debate the subject at the next alliance summit in riga , latvia in november . " there is a growing threat of long-range missile attack on nato territory and it is timely to examine ways and means of addressing that threat , " said marshall billingslea , head of nato 's conference of national armaments directors , announcing that the report had been completed . europe remains cautious europe is , nevertheless , unlikely to act too hastily . " on the european side , there is an almost categorical refusal to take decisions on the run , " said rik coolsaet of the royal institute of international relations in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us sees iran as a more immediate threat " politically , europeans understand that there is a potential danger from the iranians , but it is not a danger they see likely in the short term .
the sense of urgency is far less present in europe than in the united states , " coolsaet said . another obstacle to accepting the us plan is that it remains to be seen whether such a missile shield can actually work . former head of the pentagon 's office of operational test and evaluation says the interceptors have n't " had a successful intercept test for 4 years . "
but the pentagon has brushed this aside saying the " technical problems " are not " show stoppers . " " we are being asked - us , the europeans - to make a huge investment to buy a program which , even in the united states , is not believed to be ready , " coolsaet said . no way some observers would go as far as saying that the basic premise of the anti-missile program is essentially flawed . " i do n't see any evidence that the iranians are producing a weapon that can reach new york , " brookes said .
" i do n't see any evidence that if they had such a weapon , they would even in their wildest dreams contemplate using it given the massive preponderance of retaliatory capability the united states has . " according to brookes , it is more important to focus on current rather than potential threats . " we have to focus on the threat that really matters , and what matters at present is defending troops that might be deployed rather than defending berlin against a perception of a threat , " he said . " german politicians , french politicians and british politicians do not regard pyongyang as about to launch anything in the foreseeable future at a european capital , " brookes said .
" they just do n't .

experts say her style will increase germany 's clout . german chancellor angela merkel is setting a clear course when it comes to human rights . " this is an issue that is being supported from the top and it is significant that this is the case , " said günter nooke , the german government 's human rights representative . he said the differences between merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder were " self-evident . "
schröder , who had a very close relationship to russian president vladimir putin , had called the leader a " flawless democrat . "
merkel , on the other hand , addressed sensitive issues such as chechnya when she went to moscow in january . she also broached the delicate subject of the us prison camp at guantanamo bay before and during her inaugural visit to washington in january . no n eed to schmooze i n chi n a eberhard sandschneider , director of the german council on foreign relations ' research institute , said he was n't surprised that merkel had talked about human rights concerns while in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that at least 8,000 people get the death penalty in china each year " it is n't astonishing , as human rights are always an issue when one of our politicians goes to china , " sandschneider said .
" this sends a signal at home . " but merkel 's course was more positive than schröder 's , sandschneider said . " we finally have someone who recognizes that china does n't need to be schmoozed , " he said .
" rather , a common base needs to be found and we can go from there .
they can handle the criticism . " merkel is a tough but ho n est part n er merkel said at the end of her china visit that the country " still had deficits in human rights . " the chinese are tough negotiators , " merkel told german television zdf .
" so we have to counter just as toughly and make clear that we do n't have anything to give away . " this style of dialogue was by no means detrimental to international ties , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush praised merkel as a " clear thinker " " an interesting partner is someone who has their own opinion , " nooke said .
" the fact that there are differences of opinion does n't make us any less interesting . " merkel 's criticism of human rights issues in beijing , moscow and washington have been positively received on the international stage .
sandschneider said this was because she came across authentically . " she has an honest and straightforward manner and people value this , " sandschneider said . the first step i n a lo n g process human rights organizations have welcomed merkel 's course .
beate wagner from the human rights forum 's -lrb- hrf -rrb- coordination group said there had been a consistent upgrading of human rights under merkel .
the hrf is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . " human rights issues have been explicitly well positioned on her inaugural visits , " said wagner , who is also secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
she said this marked an " improvement " to the schröder government and was a first step . " now , more work needs to be done , " wagner said .
" we 'll have to see how much gets implemented in bilateral relations .
but we are positively looking forward to see what happens next . " of course , experts agree that merkel 's criticism will not solve problems overnight . " you ca n't have the illusion that one government is going to make a difference , " wagner said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2006 merkel makes human rights a top priority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is respected for her pragmatic manner in addressing sensitive issues in keeping with her consistently outspoken stance on sensitive issues , germany 's chancellor did not mince words on human rights during her visit to china this week .
experts say her style will increase germany 's clout . german chancellor angela merkel is setting a clear course when it comes to human rights . " this is an issue that is being supported from the top and it is significant that this is the case , " said günter nooke , the german government 's human rights representative . he said the differences between merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder were " self-evident . "
schröder , who had a very close relationship to russian president vladimir putin , had called the leader a " flawless democrat . "
merkel , on the other hand , addressed sensitive issues such as chechnya when she went to moscow in january . she also broached the delicate subject of the us prison camp at guantanamo bay before and during her inaugural visit to washington in january . no n eed to schmooze i n chi n a eberhard sandschneider , director of the german council on foreign relations ' research institute , said he was n't surprised that merkel had talked about human rights concerns while in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that at least 8,000 people get the death penalty in china each year " it is n't astonishing , as human rights are always an issue when one of our politicians goes to china , " sandschneider said .
" this sends a signal at home . " but merkel 's course was more positive than schröder 's , sandschneider said . " we finally have someone who recognizes that china does n't need to be schmoozed , " he said .
" rather , a common base needs to be found and we can go from there .
they can handle the criticism . " merkel is a tough but ho n est part n er merkel said at the end of her china visit that the country " still had deficits in human rights . " the chinese are tough negotiators , " merkel told german television zdf .
" so we have to counter just as toughly and make clear that we do n't have anything to give away . " this style of dialogue was by no means detrimental to international ties , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush praised merkel as a " clear thinker " " an interesting partner is someone who has their own opinion , " nooke said .
" the fact that there are differences of opinion does n't make us any less interesting . " merkel 's criticism of human rights issues in beijing , moscow and washington have been positively received on the international stage .
sandschneider said this was because she came across authentically . " she has an honest and straightforward manner and people value this , " sandschneider said . the first step i n a lo n g process human rights organizations have welcomed merkel 's course .
beate wagner from the human rights forum 's -lrb- hrf -rrb- coordination group said there had been a consistent upgrading of human rights under merkel .
the hrf is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . " human rights issues have been explicitly well positioned on her inaugural visits , " said wagner , who is also secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
she said this marked an " improvement " to the schröder government and was a first step . " now , more work needs to be done , " wagner said .
" we 'll have to see how much gets implemented in bilateral relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2006 merkel makes human rights a top priority großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is respected for her pragmatic manner in addressing sensitive issues in keeping with her consistently outspoken stance on sensitive issues , germany 's chancellor did not mince words on human rights during her visit to china this week .
experts say her style will increase germany 's clout . german chancellor angela merkel is setting a clear course when it comes to human rights . " this is an issue that is being supported from the top and it is significant that this is the case , " said günter nooke , the german government 's human rights representative . he said the differences between merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder were " self-evident . "
schröder , who had a very close relationship to russian president vladimir putin , had called the leader a " flawless democrat . "
merkel , on the other hand , addressed sensitive issues such as chechnya when she went to moscow in january . she also broached the delicate subject of the us prison camp at guantanamo bay before and during her inaugural visit to washington in january . no n eed to schmooze i n chi n a eberhard sandschneider , director of the german council on foreign relations ' research institute , said he was n't surprised that merkel had talked about human rights concerns while in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that at least 8,000 people get the death penalty in china each year " it is n't astonishing , as human rights are always an issue when one of our politicians goes to china , " sandschneider said .
" this sends a signal at home . " but merkel 's course was more positive than schröder 's , sandschneider said . " we finally have someone who recognizes that china does n't need to be schmoozed , " he said .
" rather , a common base needs to be found and we can go from there .
they can handle the criticism . " merkel is a tough but ho n est part n er merkel said at the end of her china visit that the country " still had deficits in human rights . " the chinese are tough negotiators , " merkel told german television zdf .
" so we have to counter just as toughly and make clear that we do n't have anything to give away . " this style of dialogue was by no means detrimental to international ties , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush praised merkel as a " clear thinker " " an interesting partner is someone who has their own opinion , " nooke said .
" the fact that there are differences of opinion does n't make us any less interesting . " merkel 's criticism of human rights issues in beijing , moscow and washington have been positively received on the international stage .
sandschneider said this was because she came across authentically . " she has an honest and straightforward manner and people value this , " sandschneider said . the first step i n a lo n g process human rights organizations have welcomed merkel 's course .
beate wagner from the human rights forum 's -lrb- hrf -rrb- coordination group said there had been a consistent upgrading of human rights under merkel .
the hrf is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . " human rights issues have been explicitly well positioned on her inaugural visits , " said wagner , who is also secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
she said this marked an " improvement " to the schröder government and was a first step . " now , more work needs to be done , " wagner said .
" we 'll have to see how much gets implemented in bilateral relations .
but we are positively looking forward to see what happens next . " of course , experts agree that merkel 's criticism will not solve problems overnight . " you ca n't have the illusion that one government is going to make a difference , " wagner said .
" but it is part of an international climate , which can exert pressure . " germa n y should use its i n ter n atio n al role i n 2007 in january , germany will take over the six-month rotating presidency of the council of the european union .

at the same time , a spate of racist attacks has germany fearing for its hard-won reputation for tolerance . the men were released after a month in police custody on tuesday because they were no longer under " strong suspicion " of beating the ethiopian-born engineer into a coma .
two men had attacked ermyas m. in april in potsdam , outside berlin , and called him a " dirty nigger . "
according to the federal prosecutor 's office , which took over the case after it attracted wide media coverage , the victim does n't remember having been beaten up and ca n't identify the attackers .
the two men remain under investigation , the prosecutor 's office said . federal prosecutor kay nehm has said he believes the attack was motivated by xenophobia . the men 's release from custody made headlines throughout the country in the midst of an impassioned public discussion about xenophobia in germany .
the alarm was sounded last week by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go , " said heye , referring to the state surrounding the capital ..
they might not make it out alive .

the two men who attacked giyasettin sayan , a regional parliamentarian for the neo-communist left party , called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack justified last week 's warnings . the premier of brandenburg , matthias platzeck , on sunday admitted that xenophobia was a problem in the state . " we have to accept that it is not a problem that can be resolved from one day to the next , " he said .
" we have gone through a phase where we minimized and denied the problem , where we said : ' my god , if we speak about this openly we will hurt our image and then nobody will come here ' . " in early january , a 12-year-old boy of ethiopian origin was attacked by a group of neo-nazi youths who forced him at gun-point to lick their boots in the eastern town of magdeburg .
they were jailed this week by a judge who said the color of the victim 's skin was " the sole reason " for the attack .
fear of tarnished image the debate about whether racism is on the rise and the damage it could do has peaked less than three weeks before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , with about one million foreign fans expected to attend the tournament .
the government has been running a campaign to promote germany as an open , friendly society in the hope that those who come will return one day . the leader of the greens , claudia roth , said there was no point in hushing the debate for fear of scaring off foreigners , as recent events spoke for themselves .

at the same time , a spate of racist attacks has germany fearing for its hard-won reputation for tolerance . the men were released after a month in police custody on tuesday because they were no longer under " strong suspicion " of beating the ethiopian-born engineer into a coma .
two men had attacked ermyas m. in april in potsdam , outside berlin , and called him a " dirty nigger . "
according to the federal prosecutor 's office , which took over the case after it attracted wide media coverage , the victim does n't remember having been beaten up and ca n't identify the attackers .
the two men remain under investigation , the prosecutor 's office said . federal prosecutor kay nehm has said he believes the attack was motivated by xenophobia . the men 's release from custody made headlines throughout the country in the midst of an impassioned public discussion about xenophobia in germany .
the alarm was sounded last week by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go , " said heye , referring to the state surrounding the capital ..
they might not make it out alive .

the two men who attacked giyasettin sayan , a regional parliamentarian for the neo-communist left party , called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack justified last week 's warnings . the premier of brandenburg , matthias platzeck , on sunday admitted that xenophobia was a problem in the state . " we have to accept that it is not a problem that can be resolved from one day to the next , " he said .
" we have gone through a phase where we minimized and denied the problem , where we said : ' my god , if we speak about this openly we will hurt our image and then nobody will come here ' . " in early january , a 12-year-old boy of ethiopian origin was attacked by a group of neo-nazi youths who forced him at gun-point to lick their boots in the eastern town of magdeburg .
they were jailed this week by a judge who said the color of the victim 's skin was " the sole reason " for the attack .
fear of tarnished image the debate about whether racism is on the rise and the damage it could do has peaked less than three weeks before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , with about one million foreign fans expected to attend the tournament .
the government has been running a campaign to promote germany as an open , friendly society in the hope that those who come will return one day . the leader of the greens , claudia roth , said there was no point in hushing the debate for fear of scaring off foreigners , as recent events spoke for themselves . " it is not talking about the far-right that threatens to harm our reputation but the very facts themselves .
these are not lone incidents , but that we have a widespread , deep-seated problem with right-wing extremist violence in our country . "

interior minister wolfgang schäuble released statistics on monday saying that the number of violent crimes attributed to the far-right had risen by 23 percent in 2005 . wilhelm heitmeyer , a sociologist at the university of bielefeld , blamed the poor state of the economy and the frustration it created for animosity towards foreigners .

the aid will include setting up naval and air patrols . the offer came after autonomous spanish authorities in the canary islands called on madrid and the european union for help . " we can not solve problems overnight , however we are very willing and committed to assist the spanish government in our best possible ways , either with financial means -lrb- or -rrb- operationally , " an eu spokesman said . his comments came as spanish and eu officials held talks in brussels late tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of refugees are estimated to die in sea crossings about 7,500 illegal immigrants have landed in the canaries this year , with some 2,000 africans reaching the islands this month alone .
that compares with 4,751 for the whole of last year , and 8,500 in 2004 . ' a european problem ' the incredible rise in illegal immigrant numbers comes as a result of moves by morocco and spain to block easier migration routes into europe .
now , the migrants leave from the west sahara , mauritania and senegal , often packed into small fishing boats .
spain 's deputy prime minister , maria-teresa fernandez de la vega , said the whole of europe should take responsibility for the problem . “ it ’ s clear that this is not just a problem which affects spain , but one that concerns the whole of europe .
it ’ s a difficult situation , which affects millions of people trying to leave their continent .
we have to approach the migration problem from different angles : cooperation with the refugees ' countries of origin , development aid and regulating the influx to europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa fernandez de la vega initially , frontex , eu 's expert border-control agency in poland , will be sent in to advise spanish border guards .

" already eight have come forward who are ready to provide rapid offshore vessels and reconnaissance planes . " pledge from brussels the aim is to locate and detain vessels as they are leaving the african coast .
spain says the eu has also proposed setting up reception centers for immigrants who arrive in the canaries .
brussels has also pledged some 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in aid to madrid to cope with the refugees . spain 's fernandez de la vega was due to hold further talks on the problem with european commission president jose manuel barroso , external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , justice commissioner franco frattini and the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : " after those meetings i think we will have a very good view on what it is the spanish government would like the european union , particularly the commission , to do , " said an eu spokesman . " we would then have a best overview of the measures requested and we could then obviously devise our own response to this , " he said . looking at africa the problem must also be addressed in africa itself .
in the long-term , the eu says it will work to improve the situation in the refugees ' own countries .
however , this will be a long and arduous process . spain and senegal agreed to work on stemming the flow of immigration on tuesday , but failed to sign a formal repatriation agreement .
the main reason many africans want to leave is due to extreme poverty .
niger ’ s foreign ministry says this is the real problem that must be tackled to stop migration . spanish policy is to deport all migrants who don ’ t meet asylum conditions .
however , those with no identification , or from countries that have no deportation accord with madrid , often simply end up moving elsewhere in europe . spain ’ s foreign minister has complained that the bureaucracy of the system means he is constantly required to sign new deportation agreements with african countries .

brussels has also pledged some 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in aid to madrid to cope with the refugees . spain 's fernandez de la vega was due to hold further talks on the problem with european commission president jose manuel barroso , external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , justice commissioner franco frattini and the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : " after those meetings i think we will have a very good view on what it is the spanish government would like the european union , particularly the commission , to do , " said an eu spokesman . " we would then have a best overview of the measures requested and we could then obviously devise our own response to this , " he said . looking at africa the problem must also be addressed in africa itself .
in the long-term , the eu says it will work to improve the situation in the refugees ' own countries .
however , this will be a long and arduous process . spain and senegal agreed to work on stemming the flow of immigration on tuesday , but failed to sign a formal repatriation agreement .
the main reason many africans want to leave is due to extreme poverty .
niger ’ s foreign ministry says this is the real problem that must be tackled to stop migration . spanish policy is to deport all migrants who don ’ t meet asylum conditions .
however , those with no identification , or from countries that have no deportation accord with madrid , often simply end up moving elsewhere in europe . spain ’ s foreign minister has complained that the bureaucracy of the system means he is constantly required to sign new deportation agreements with african countries .

both polls were conducted by polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns observe the construction of an altar for pope benedict xvi 's holy mass outside of krakow benedict xvi is due thursday to start a four-day visit to poland .
his itinerary will take him to places that were significant in john paul ii 's life and papacy , and also to the former nazi death camp at auschwitz-birkenau , on the outskirts of the southern polish town of oswiecim . hope for better relations last week , the primate of poland , cardinal jozef glemp , said the visit by the pope would help to improve relations between poles and germans , who still have not fully healed all the wounds opened by the german invasion of poland in september 1939 , which sparked world war ii . " i think that benedict 's nationality will bring poles and germans closer together , " glemp said in an interview with warsaw daily zycie warszawy . important gesture " how can one fail to appreciate the fact that the pope , whose origins are german , is visiting - at the beginning of his pontificate - warsaw , which was destroyed during the war , and the auschwitz death camp ? " a gesture like that can not be overlooked , either in its social or its political dimension , " glemp said . the surveys , conducted by pbs dga in poland and demoskopie allensbach in germany , also asked what importance poles and germans attached to the fact that benedict 's predecessor , john paul ii , was polish in origin . eighty-two percent of poles said it was " good " that the pope was polish , while the remaining 18 percent attached no great weight to john paul ii 's nationality .
no one had a negative opinion on the matter . in the german survey , 67 percent of respondents said the fact john paul ii was polish was positive , 30 percent said it was unimportant , and three percent had a negative opinion . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2006 racist attacks have germany on edge ahead of world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many potsdamers were horrified by what happened in their city federal prosecutors have released two men suspected of beating a black man into a coma - for lack of evidence .
at the same time , a spate of racist attacks has germany fearing for its hard-won reputation for tolerance . the men were released after a month in police custody on tuesday because they were no longer under " strong suspicion " of beating the ethiopian-born engineer into a coma .
two men had attacked ermyas m. in april in potsdam , outside berlin , and called him a " dirty nigger . "
according to the federal prosecutor 's office , which took over the case after it attracted wide media coverage , the victim does n't remember having been beaten up and ca n't identify the attackers .
the two men remain under investigation , the prosecutor 's office said . federal prosecutor kay nehm has said he believes the attack was motivated by xenophobia . the men 's release from custody made headlines throughout the country in the midst of an impassioned public discussion about xenophobia in germany .
the alarm was sounded last week by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go , " said heye , referring to the state surrounding the capital ..
they might not make it out alive . " heye , now a spokesman for an anti-racism lobby , was not alone in warning of xenophobic pockets in the former communist east , where the country 's neo-nazi party has found a following among unemployed youths . the africa council , a group for expatriates , plans to publish a " no-go-area " brochure listing clubs , bars and restaurants in and around berlin which should give black soccer fans a wide berth . politician attacked but politicians and football authorities said heye 's statement scored an own goal for a country , which has painstakingly confronted its nazi past to earn a reputation for political correctness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sayan was attacked over the weekend over the weekend , the debate took another turn when a german politician of turkish origin was beaten and his head slashed with a broken bottle in lichtenberg , a working class part of berlin known as a neo-nazi stronghold .
the two men who attacked giyasettin sayan , a regional parliamentarian for the neo-communist left party , called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack justified last week 's warnings . the premier of brandenburg , matthias platzeck , on sunday admitted that xenophobia was a problem in the state . " we have to accept that it is not a problem that can be resolved from one day to the next , " he said .
" we have gone through a phase where we minimized and denied the problem , where we said : ' my god , if we speak about this openly we will hurt our image and then nobody will come here ' . " in early january , a 12-year-old boy of ethiopian origin was attacked by a group of neo-nazi youths who forced him at gun-point to lick their boots in the eastern town of magdeburg .
they were jailed this week by a judge who said the color of the victim 's skin was " the sole reason " for the attack .
fear of tarnished image the debate about whether racism is on the rise and the damage it could do has peaked less than three weeks before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , with about one million foreign fans expected to attend the tournament .
the government has been running a campaign to promote germany as an open , friendly society in the hope that those who come will return one day . the leader of the greens , claudia roth , said there was no point in hushing the debate for fear of scaring off foreigners , as recent events spoke for themselves . " it is not talking about the far-right that threatens to harm our reputation but the very facts themselves .
these are not lone incidents , but that we have a widespread , deep-seated problem with right-wing extremist violence in our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi attacks have increased in germany over the weekend , bild newspaper leaked an extract of a government report stating that the number of neo-nazis in germany had grown from 3,800 in 2004 to 4,200 last year .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble released statistics on monday saying that the number of violent crimes attributed to the far-right had risen by 23 percent in 2005 . wilhelm heitmeyer , a sociologist at the university of bielefeld , blamed the poor state of the economy and the frustration it created for animosity towards foreigners . " it is a german problem , though there is a stronger tendency in the east , " heitmeyer told the news agency afp .
" it has to do with the fear of social decline , which is greater there .
if you have no standing , you start beating up on other , weaker groups .

at the same time , a spate of racist attacks has germany fearing for its hard-won reputation for tolerance . the men were released after a month in police custody on tuesday because they were no longer under " strong suspicion " of beating the ethiopian-born engineer into a coma .
two men had attacked ermyas m. in april in potsdam , outside berlin , and called him a " dirty nigger . "
according to the federal prosecutor 's office , which took over the case after it attracted wide media coverage , the victim does n't remember having been beaten up and ca n't identify the attackers .
the two men remain under investigation , the prosecutor 's office said . federal prosecutor kay nehm has said he believes the attack was motivated by xenophobia . the men 's release from custody made headlines throughout the country in the midst of an impassioned public discussion about xenophobia in germany .
the alarm was sounded last week by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go , " said heye , referring to the state surrounding the capital ..
they might not make it out alive . " heye , now a spokesman for an anti-racism lobby , was not alone in warning of xenophobic pockets in the former communist east , where the country 's neo-nazi party has found a following among unemployed youths . the africa council , a group for expatriates , plans to publish a " no-go-area " brochure listing clubs , bars and restaurants in and around berlin which should give black soccer fans a wide berth . politician attacked but politicians and football authorities said heye 's statement scored an own goal for a country , which has painstakingly confronted its nazi past to earn a reputation for political correctness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sayan was attacked over the weekend over the weekend , the debate took another turn when a german politician of turkish origin was beaten and his head slashed with a broken bottle in lichtenberg , a working class part of berlin known as a neo-nazi stronghold .
the two men who attacked giyasettin sayan , a regional parliamentarian for the neo-communist left party , called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack justified last week 's warnings . the premier of brandenburg , matthias platzeck , on sunday admitted that xenophobia was a problem in the state . " we have to accept that it is not a problem that can be resolved from one day to the next , " he said .
" we have gone through a phase where we minimized and denied the problem , where we said : ' my god , if we speak about this openly we will hurt our image and then nobody will come here ' . " in early january , a 12-year-old boy of ethiopian origin was attacked by a group of neo-nazi youths who forced him at gun-point to lick their boots in the eastern town of magdeburg .
they were jailed this week by a judge who said the color of the victim 's skin was " the sole reason " for the attack .
fear of tarnished image the debate about whether racism is on the rise and the damage it could do has peaked less than three weeks before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , with about one million foreign fans expected to attend the tournament .
the government has been running a campaign to promote germany as an open , friendly society in the hope that those who come will return one day . the leader of the greens , claudia roth , said there was no point in hushing the debate for fear of scaring off foreigners , as recent events spoke for themselves . " it is not talking about the far-right that threatens to harm our reputation but the very facts themselves .
these are not lone incidents , but that we have a widespread , deep-seated problem with right-wing extremist violence in our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi attacks have increased in germany over the weekend , bild newspaper leaked an extract of a government report stating that the number of neo-nazis in germany had grown from 3,800 in 2004 to 4,200 last year .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble released statistics on monday saying that the number of violent crimes attributed to the far-right had risen by 23 percent in 2005 . wilhelm heitmeyer , a sociologist at the university of bielefeld , blamed the poor state of the economy and the frustration it created for animosity towards foreigners . " it is a german problem , though there is a stronger tendency in the east , " heitmeyer told the news agency afp .
" it has to do with the fear of social decline , which is greater there .
if you have no standing , you start beating up on other , weaker groups .

" i think that benedict 's nationality will bring poles and germans closer together , " glemp said in an interview with warsaw daily zycie warszawy . important gesture " how can one fail to appreciate the fact that the pope , whose origins are german , is visiting - at the beginning of his pontificate - warsaw , which was destroyed during the war , and the auschwitz death camp ? " a gesture like that can not be overlooked , either in its social or its political dimension , " glemp said . the surveys , conducted by pbs dga in poland and demoskopie allensbach in germany , also asked what importance poles and germans attached to the fact that benedict 's predecessor , john paul ii , was polish in origin . eighty-two percent of poles said it was " good " that the pope was polish , while the remaining 18 percent attached no great weight to john paul ii 's nationality .
no one had a negative opinion on the matter . in the german survey , 67 percent of respondents said the fact john paul ii was polish was positive , 30 percent said it was unimportant , and three percent had a negative opinion . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.05.2006 europe skeptical about us missile shield plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not entirely clear if the us missile defense system would actually benefit europe as tensions grow over iran 's nuclear program , the us is allegedly moving to locate a missile defense system in europe .
european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good . the united states is trying to rally its partners behind plans to build a missile shield but many in europe , where some of the network would be based , remain skeptical , defense analysts say . the system , which will consist of 10 antimissile interceptors - rockets designed to shoot down incoming missiles - is scheduled to be ready by 2011 .
it will be integrated into a broader american missile defense system that is designed to protect the us homeland - not europe , per se . iran , deep in conflict with the west over its nuclear program , announced in april that it had tested a new generation of medium-range missile featuring multiple warheads and radar-evading technology . the pentagon says that no decision has been taken yet about where on the old continent the missile defense system might be located . " we expect these consultations will continue in the coming weeks and months with countries that have expressed an interest , " pentagon spokesman bryan whitman told reporters in washington on monday . a difference in perception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a necessity , some as a space wars fantasy some experts suggest the plans have run up against different visions of what constitutes a threat on either side of the atlantic . " there is a difference in perception , " said andrew brookes of the london-based international institute for strategic studies . " america is looking at protection from strategic missile attacks from places like china , north korea and iran .
europe does n't believe that 's a threat . " " europeans , inherently , do n't buy into this fantasy , " brookes said . the plans are the latest chapter in the development of an anti-missile program , initially attempted at great cost under us president ronald reagan during the cold war .
the current system is no longer aimed at russia , rather its aimed at so-called " rogue states " - and is specifically designed to counter a potential nuclear strike from iran . at nato headquarters , officials refused to publicly comment on the us plans . " the us took a political decision to go ahead with the deployment of a missile defense system years ago whereas europe has n't had that discussion , " one nato source said , adding that washington is " forging ahead . " possible scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful radar on its way to a us base in alaska the debate may not yet have taken place , but the 26 members of nato have in hand a 10,000-page feasibility study setting out the case for a missile shield and the possible scenarios in which one might be useful . ordered by nato leaders in prague in 2002 , the text has not been discussed at political level yet , but the united states is pushing its allies to debate the subject at the next alliance summit in riga , latvia in november .

and just ahead of the talks , a report emerged of differences of opinion within the us administration over strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice , speaking at a meeting on iran 's nuclear policies , in march us secretary of state condoleezza rice had " gone out on a limb " to back the european package of trade and technology incentives but had met resistance from vice-president dick cheney , the financial times newspaper reported . cheney is said to be against the idea of " rewarding bad behavior " after iran allegedly breached its nuclear safeguards commitments , according to the newspaper report based on comments from diplomats and analysts . it said that the divisions were complicating the eu proposal that world powers support iran 's building of several light water reactors , set up a nuclear fuel bank , and have the united states drop restrictions on iran 's buying of us commercial airplanes , if tehran takes steps to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons . but if tehran does not do this , sanctions should follow , including an arms embargo , according to the proposal . russia supports eu plan the newspaper said some european diplomats think the us will back their proposals if russia supports a tough un resolution that would require iran to suspend uranium enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministesr lavrov -lrb- left -rrb- met german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in april to discuss the iran issue during a tour of arab gulf countries kuwait and qatar on tuesday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said moscow supports the eu proposal and urged tehran to cooperate . asked if russia would back military action against iran if the proposed negotiations collapsed , lavrov declined to answer but insisted that moscow does not support the use of force " in principle . " the united states , britain , france , china and russia are the five permanent members of the un security council , which has the power to endorse sanctions or us military strikes , an option which is nonetheless broadly opposed . iran 's hardline government has already rejected the european offer and insisted its uranium enrichment program is not up for negotiation .
in tehran earlier , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad boasted that the islamic republic had " mastered the entire nuclear fuel cycle " and that it would give an " historic slap " to any attacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general annan urged iran to hear out the latest proposal u.n. secretary-general kofi annan , speaking in vietnam , said he had appealed to iran to reassure the world that its nuclear intentions are peaceful and asked it " not to reject anything out of hand " which might emerge from the talks in london . exercise in futility ? but one eu diplomat said it was hard to see what the meeting , which started around midday , could achieve .
" it 's really just an academic exercise , since the iranians have made it clear that they wo n't accept any offer , " he told reuters news service . the united states has refused to rule out military action . iran says it wants to use the fuel cycle only to make civilian reactor fuel , and argues such work for peaceful purposes is a " right " enshrined by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . but the same technology can be extended to make atomic weapons , and the us in particular claims iran is merely exploiting a loophole in the npt . citing us officials , iranian analysts and foreign diplomats , the washington post newspaper reported wednesday that iran had requested through intermediaries direct talks with washington over its nuclear program . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-3 preparing new incentives for iran while us talks tough the un security council 's five permanent members plus germany are to meet in london to consider new incentives being prepared by european negotiators for iran to renounce its disputed nuclear program .

the aid will include setting up naval and air patrols . the offer came after autonomous spanish authorities in the canary islands called on madrid and the european union for help . " we can not solve problems overnight , however we are very willing and committed to assist the spanish government in our best possible ways , either with financial means -lrb- or -rrb- operationally , " an eu spokesman said . his comments came as spanish and eu officials held talks in brussels late tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of refugees are estimated to die in sea crossings about 7,500 illegal immigrants have landed in the canaries this year , with some 2,000 africans reaching the islands this month alone .
that compares with 4,751 for the whole of last year , and 8,500 in 2004 . ' a european problem ' the incredible rise in illegal immigrant numbers comes as a result of moves by morocco and spain to block easier migration routes into europe .
now , the migrants leave from the west sahara , mauritania and senegal , often packed into small fishing boats .
spain 's deputy prime minister , maria-teresa fernandez de la vega , said the whole of europe should take responsibility for the problem . “ it ’ s clear that this is not just a problem which affects spain , but one that concerns the whole of europe .
it ’ s a difficult situation , which affects millions of people trying to leave their continent .
we have to approach the migration problem from different angles : cooperation with the refugees ' countries of origin , development aid and regulating the influx to europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa fernandez de la vega initially , frontex , eu 's expert border-control agency in poland , will be sent in to advise spanish border guards .
they are also to construct a coordination point in the canary islands .
and eu justice and interior affairs commissioner franco frattini said spain can also expect back-up from other eu states . “ in two weeks we will be able to call upon member states , " said frattini .
" already eight have come forward who are ready to provide rapid offshore vessels and reconnaissance planes . " pledge from brussels the aim is to locate and detain vessels as they are leaving the african coast .
spain says the eu has also proposed setting up reception centers for immigrants who arrive in the canaries .
brussels has also pledged some 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in aid to madrid to cope with the refugees . spain 's fernandez de la vega was due to hold further talks on the problem with european commission president jose manuel barroso , external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , justice commissioner franco frattini and the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : " after those meetings i think we will have a very good view on what it is the spanish government would like the european union , particularly the commission , to do , " said an eu spokesman . " we would then have a best overview of the measures requested and we could then obviously devise our own response to this , " he said . looking at africa the problem must also be addressed in africa itself .
in the long-term , the eu says it will work to improve the situation in the refugees ' own countries .
however , this will be a long and arduous process . spain and senegal agreed to work on stemming the flow of immigration on tuesday , but failed to sign a formal repatriation agreement .
the main reason many africans want to leave is due to extreme poverty .
niger ’ s foreign ministry says this is the real problem that must be tackled to stop migration . spanish policy is to deport all migrants who don ’ t meet asylum conditions .
however , those with no identification , or from countries that have no deportation accord with madrid , often simply end up moving elsewhere in europe . spain ’ s foreign minister has complained that the bureaucracy of the system means he is constantly required to sign new deportation agreements with african countries .

conservative values have been making a comeback among germany 's youth in recent years .
but parents punished with obstreperous offspring can not always relay on the help of authorities , as one mother had to find out . hildesheim in northern germany is n't exactly known as hedonist central .

she called the city 's youth services department and complained to officials about her child 's mä n n ergeschichte n , which literally translates to " men tales . " given the nature of the complaint , asking about the daughter 's age probably seemed like a reasonable thing to do . " she 's 68 , " the 92-year-old mother told youth service officials , who responded that the daughter was about half a century too old to fall under their jurisdiction .
instead , they dispatched a team of police officers to the mother 's home .
law enforcement officials apparently managed to end the fight between the couple . reports that the daughter 's been grounded for the next four weeks could not be confirmed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's graying gangsters criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2006 racist attacks have germany on edge ahead of world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many potsdamers were horrified by what happened in their city federal prosecutors have released two men suspected of beating a black man into a coma - for lack of evidence .
at the same time , a spate of racist attacks has germany fearing for its hard-won reputation for tolerance . the men were released after a month in police custody on tuesday because they were no longer under " strong suspicion " of beating the ethiopian-born engineer into a coma .
two men had attacked ermyas m. in april in potsdam , outside berlin , and called him a " dirty nigger . "
according to the federal prosecutor 's office , which took over the case after it attracted wide media coverage , the victim does n't remember having been beaten up and ca n't identify the attackers .
the two men remain under investigation , the prosecutor 's office said . federal prosecutor kay nehm has said he believes the attack was motivated by xenophobia . the men 's release from custody made headlines throughout the country in the midst of an impassioned public discussion about xenophobia in germany .
the alarm was sounded last week by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go , " said heye , referring to the state surrounding the capital ..
they might not make it out alive . " heye , now a spokesman for an anti-racism lobby , was not alone in warning of xenophobic pockets in the former communist east , where the country 's neo-nazi party has found a following among unemployed youths . the africa council , a group for expatriates , plans to publish a " no-go-area " brochure listing clubs , bars and restaurants in and around berlin which should give black soccer fans a wide berth . politician attacked but politicians and football authorities said heye 's statement scored an own goal for a country , which has painstakingly confronted its nazi past to earn a reputation for political correctness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sayan was attacked over the weekend over the weekend , the debate took another turn when a german politician of turkish origin was beaten and his head slashed with a broken bottle in lichtenberg , a working class part of berlin known as a neo-nazi stronghold .
the two men who attacked giyasettin sayan , a regional parliamentarian for the neo-communist left party , called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack justified last week 's warnings . the premier of brandenburg , matthias platzeck , on sunday admitted that xenophobia was a problem in the state . " we have to accept that it is not a problem that can be resolved from one day to the next , " he said .
" we have gone through a phase where we minimized and denied the problem , where we said : ' my god , if we speak about this openly we will hurt our image and then nobody will come here ' . " in early january , a 12-year-old boy of ethiopian origin was attacked by a group of neo-nazi youths who forced him at gun-point to lick their boots in the eastern town of magdeburg .
they were jailed this week by a judge who said the color of the victim 's skin was " the sole reason " for the attack .
fear of tarnished image the debate about whether racism is on the rise and the damage it could do has peaked less than three weeks before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , with about one million foreign fans expected to attend the tournament .

at the same time , a spate of racist attacks has germany fearing for its hard-won reputation for tolerance . the men were released after a month in police custody on tuesday because they were no longer under " strong suspicion " of beating the ethiopian-born engineer into a coma .
two men had attacked ermyas m. in april in potsdam , outside berlin , and called him a " dirty nigger . "
according to the federal prosecutor 's office , which took over the case after it attracted wide media coverage , the victim does n't remember having been beaten up and ca n't identify the attackers .
the two men remain under investigation , the prosecutor 's office said . federal prosecutor kay nehm has said he believes the attack was motivated by xenophobia . the men 's release from custody made headlines throughout the country in the midst of an impassioned public discussion about xenophobia in germany .
the alarm was sounded last week by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go , " said heye , referring to the state surrounding the capital ..

the two men who attacked giyasettin sayan , a regional parliamentarian for the neo-communist left party , called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack justified last week 's warnings . the premier of brandenburg , matthias platzeck , on sunday admitted that xenophobia was a problem in the state . " we have to accept that it is not a problem that can be resolved from one day to the next , " he said .
" we have gone through a phase where we minimized and denied the problem , where we said : ' my god , if we speak about this openly we will hurt our image and then nobody will come here ' . " in early january , a 12-year-old boy of ethiopian origin was attacked by a group of neo-nazi youths who forced him at gun-point to lick their boots in the eastern town of magdeburg .

"
conservative values have been making a comeback among germany 's youth in recent years .
but parents punished with obstreperous offspring can not always relay on the help of authorities , as one mother had to find out . hildesheim in northern germany is n't exactly known as hedonist central .
the city of about 100,000 people takes pride in its architectural gems , such as " one of the world 's prettiest " market squares and two religious buildings that have been included in the unesco 's list of world cultural heritage sites : st. michaelis ' church and the city 's cathedral , where hildesheimers flock each year to admire the blossoming rose tree , which allegedly was planted more than 1,000 years ago . the city has come up with cute little cartoons to gently remind people that they 'll have to pay 50 euros -lrb- $ 64 -rrb- for dropping a chewing gum on the street or that not cleaning up after their dogs will set them back double that amount .
germany 's snoring museum is actually not located in hildesheim proper , but in a little town nearby . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : appearances deceive : despite the serenity of st. michaelis , not all is well in hildesheim but all this can not deter from the fact that not all is well in hildesheim as far as morals are concerned : some of the city 's young ladies appear to engage in absolutely inappropriate behavior when it comes to their relationships with men . one virtuous hildesheimer mother now recently decided to put a stop to her daughter 's indecent philandering .
she called the city 's youth services department and complained to officials about her child 's mä n n ergeschichte n , which literally translates to " men tales . " given the nature of the complaint , asking about the daughter 's age probably seemed like a reasonable thing to do . " she 's 68 , " the 92-year-old mother told youth service officials , who responded that the daughter was about half a century too old to fall under their jurisdiction .
instead , they dispatched a team of police officers to the mother 's home .
law enforcement officials apparently managed to end the fight between the couple . reports that the daughter 's been grounded for the next four weeks could not be confirmed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's graying gangsters criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .

and just ahead of the talks , a report emerged of differences of opinion within the us administration over strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice , speaking at a meeting on iran 's nuclear policies , in march us secretary of state condoleezza rice had " gone out on a limb " to back the european package of trade and technology incentives but had met resistance from vice-president dick cheney , the financial times newspaper reported . cheney is said to be against the idea of " rewarding bad behavior " after iran allegedly breached its nuclear safeguards commitments , according to the newspaper report based on comments from diplomats and analysts . it said that the divisions were complicating the eu proposal that world powers support iran 's building of several light water reactors , set up a nuclear fuel bank , and have the united states drop restrictions on iran 's buying of us commercial airplanes , if tehran takes steps to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons . but if tehran does not do this , sanctions should follow , including an arms embargo , according to the proposal . russia supports eu plan the newspaper said some european diplomats think the us will back their proposals if russia supports a tough un resolution that would require iran to suspend uranium enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministesr lavrov -lrb- left -rrb- met german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in april to discuss the iran issue during a tour of arab gulf countries kuwait and qatar on tuesday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said moscow supports the eu proposal and urged tehran to cooperate . asked if russia would back military action against iran if the proposed negotiations collapsed , lavrov declined to answer but insisted that moscow does not support the use of force " in principle . " the united states , britain , france , china and russia are the five permanent members of the un security council , which has the power to endorse sanctions or us military strikes , an option which is nonetheless broadly opposed . iran 's hardline government has already rejected the european offer and insisted its uranium enrichment program is not up for negotiation .
in tehran earlier , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad boasted that the islamic republic had " mastered the entire nuclear fuel cycle " and that it would give an " historic slap " to any attacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general annan urged iran to hear out the latest proposal u.n. secretary-general kofi annan , speaking in vietnam , said he had appealed to iran to reassure the world that its nuclear intentions are peaceful and asked it " not to reject anything out of hand " which might emerge from the talks in london . exercise in futility ? but one eu diplomat said it was hard to see what the meeting , which started around midday , could achieve .
" it 's really just an academic exercise , since the iranians have made it clear that they wo n't accept any offer , " he told reuters news service . the united states has refused to rule out military action . iran says it wants to use the fuel cycle only to make civilian reactor fuel , and argues such work for peaceful purposes is a " right " enshrined by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . but the same technology can be extended to make atomic weapons , and the us in particular claims iran is merely exploiting a loophole in the npt . citing us officials , iranian analysts and foreign diplomats , the washington post newspaper reported wednesday that iran had requested through intermediaries direct talks with washington over its nuclear program . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-3 preparing new incentives for iran while us talks tough the un security council 's five permanent members plus germany are to meet in london to consider new incentives being prepared by european negotiators for iran to renounce its disputed nuclear program .

the aid will include setting up naval and air patrols . the offer came after autonomous spanish authorities in the canary islands called on madrid and the european union for help . " we can not solve problems overnight , however we are very willing and committed to assist the spanish government in our best possible ways , either with financial means -lrb- or -rrb- operationally , " an eu spokesman said . his comments came as spanish and eu officials held talks in brussels late tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of refugees are estimated to die in sea crossings about 7,500 illegal immigrants have landed in the canaries this year , with some 2,000 africans reaching the islands this month alone .
that compares with 4,751 for the whole of last year , and 8,500 in 2004 . ' a european problem ' the incredible rise in illegal immigrant numbers comes as a result of moves by morocco and spain to block easier migration routes into europe .
now , the migrants leave from the west sahara , mauritania and senegal , often packed into small fishing boats .
spain 's deputy prime minister , maria-teresa fernandez de la vega , said the whole of europe should take responsibility for the problem . “ it ’ s clear that this is not just a problem which affects spain , but one that concerns the whole of europe .
it ’ s a difficult situation , which affects millions of people trying to leave their continent .
we have to approach the migration problem from different angles : cooperation with the refugees ' countries of origin , development aid and regulating the influx to europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa fernandez de la vega initially , frontex , eu 's expert border-control agency in poland , will be sent in to advise spanish border guards .
they are also to construct a coordination point in the canary islands .
and eu justice and interior affairs commissioner franco frattini said spain can also expect back-up from other eu states . “ in two weeks we will be able to call upon member states , " said frattini .
" already eight have come forward who are ready to provide rapid offshore vessels and reconnaissance planes . " pledge from brussels the aim is to locate and detain vessels as they are leaving the african coast .
spain says the eu has also proposed setting up reception centers for immigrants who arrive in the canaries .
brussels has also pledged some 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in aid to madrid to cope with the refugees . spain 's fernandez de la vega was due to hold further talks on the problem with european commission president jose manuel barroso , external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , justice commissioner franco frattini and the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : " after those meetings i think we will have a very good view on what it is the spanish government would like the european union , particularly the commission , to do , " said an eu spokesman . " we would then have a best overview of the measures requested and we could then obviously devise our own response to this , " he said . looking at africa the problem must also be addressed in africa itself .
in the long-term , the eu says it will work to improve the situation in the refugees ' own countries .
however , this will be a long and arduous process . spain and senegal agreed to work on stemming the flow of immigration on tuesday , but failed to sign a formal repatriation agreement .
the main reason many africans want to leave is due to extreme poverty .
niger ’ s foreign ministry says this is the real problem that must be tackled to stop migration . spanish policy is to deport all migrants who don ’ t meet asylum conditions .
however , those with no identification , or from countries that have no deportation accord with madrid , often simply end up moving elsewhere in europe . spain ’ s foreign minister has complained that the bureaucracy of the system means he is constantly required to sign new deportation agreements with african countries .
but human rights groups are warning against any mass deportation policy , which they claim legitimate asylum seekers could also get caught up in . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tighter eu borders forcing refugees to take bigger risks with every new influx of refugees from africa , the eu is under increased pressure .

experts say her style will increase germany 's clout . german chancellor angela merkel is setting a clear course when it comes to human rights . " this is an issue that is being supported from the top and it is significant that this is the case , " said günter nooke , the german government 's human rights representative . he said the differences between merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder were " self-evident . "
schröder , who had a very close relationship to russian president vladimir putin , had called the leader a " flawless democrat . "
merkel , on the other hand , addressed sensitive issues such as chechnya when she went to moscow in january . she also broached the delicate subject of the us prison camp at guantanamo bay before and during her inaugural visit to washington in january . no n eed to schmooze i n chi n a eberhard sandschneider , director of the german council on foreign relations ' research institute , said he was n't surprised that merkel had talked about human rights concerns while in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that at least 8,000 people get the death penalty in china each year " it is n't astonishing , as human rights are always an issue when one of our politicians goes to china , " sandschneider said .
" this sends a signal at home . " but merkel 's course was more positive than schröder 's , sandschneider said . " we finally have someone who recognizes that china does n't need to be schmoozed , " he said .
" rather , a common base needs to be found and we can go from there .
they can handle the criticism . " merkel is a tough but ho n est part n er merkel said at the end of her china visit that the country " still had deficits in human rights . " the chinese are tough negotiators , " merkel told german television zdf .
" so we have to counter just as toughly and make clear that we do n't have anything to give away . " this style of dialogue was by no means detrimental to international ties , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush praised merkel as a " clear thinker " " an interesting partner is someone who has their own opinion , " nooke said .
" the fact that there are differences of opinion does n't make us any less interesting . " merkel 's criticism of human rights issues in beijing , moscow and washington have been positively received on the international stage .
sandschneider said this was because she came across authentically . " she has an honest and straightforward manner and people value this , " sandschneider said . the first step i n a lo n g process human rights organizations have welcomed merkel 's course .
beate wagner from the human rights forum 's -lrb- hrf -rrb- coordination group said there had been a consistent upgrading of human rights under merkel .
the hrf is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . " human rights issues have been explicitly well positioned on her inaugural visits , " said wagner , who is also secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
she said this marked an " improvement " to the schröder government and was a first step . " now , more work needs to be done , " wagner said .
" we 'll have to see how much gets implemented in bilateral relations .
but we are positively looking forward to see what happens next . " of course , experts agree that merkel 's criticism will not solve problems overnight . " you ca n't have the illusion that one government is going to make a difference , " wagner said .
" but it is part of an international climate , which can exert pressure . " germa n y should use its i n ter n atio n al role i n 2007 in january , germany will take over the six-month rotating presidency of the council of the european union .
it will also hold the g8 presidency in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will chair the council of the european union for the first half of 2007 wagner said germany could use these positions to increase international pressure regarding human rights . " it can set impulses in un meetings , for example , when it has the voice as head of the european council , " she said . nooke said he was interested in keeping human rights on the agenda in the european council next year . " it is important that europe pull together and carry weight in international bodies , " nooke said .
" we have to have the courage to address critical issues .
it can be that someone may not be happy with this , but in the medium and long term , it 's worth it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.05.2006 eu pledges aid to spain on african migrant problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of african immigrants has soared since policies were changed the european union has offered to help spain deal with a wave of illegal immigrants abandoning africa for the canary islands .
the aid will include setting up naval and air patrols . the offer came after autonomous spanish authorities in the canary islands called on madrid and the european union for help . " we can not solve problems overnight , however we are very willing and committed to assist the spanish government in our best possible ways , either with financial means -lrb- or -rrb- operationally , " an eu spokesman said . his comments came as spanish and eu officials held talks in brussels late tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of refugees are estimated to die in sea crossings about 7,500 illegal immigrants have landed in the canaries this year , with some 2,000 africans reaching the islands this month alone .
that compares with 4,751 for the whole of last year , and 8,500 in 2004 . ' a european problem ' the incredible rise in illegal immigrant numbers comes as a result of moves by morocco and spain to block easier migration routes into europe .
now , the migrants leave from the west sahara , mauritania and senegal , often packed into small fishing boats .
spain 's deputy prime minister , maria-teresa fernandez de la vega , said the whole of europe should take responsibility for the problem . “ it ’ s clear that this is not just a problem which affects spain , but one that concerns the whole of europe .
it ’ s a difficult situation , which affects millions of people trying to leave their continent .
we have to approach the migration problem from different angles : cooperation with the refugees ' countries of origin , development aid and regulating the influx to europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa fernandez de la vega initially , frontex , eu 's expert border-control agency in poland , will be sent in to advise spanish border guards .
they are also to construct a coordination point in the canary islands .
and eu justice and interior affairs commissioner franco frattini said spain can also expect back-up from other eu states . “ in two weeks we will be able to call upon member states , " said frattini .
" already eight have come forward who are ready to provide rapid offshore vessels and reconnaissance planes . " pledge from brussels the aim is to locate and detain vessels as they are leaving the african coast .
spain says the eu has also proposed setting up reception centers for immigrants who arrive in the canaries .
brussels has also pledged some 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in aid to madrid to cope with the refugees . spain 's fernandez de la vega was due to hold further talks on the problem with european commission president jose manuel barroso , external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , justice commissioner franco frattini and the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : " after those meetings i think we will have a very good view on what it is the spanish government would like the european union , particularly the commission , to do , " said an eu spokesman . " we would then have a best overview of the measures requested and we could then obviously devise our own response to this , " he said . looking at africa the problem must also be addressed in africa itself .
in the long-term , the eu says it will work to improve the situation in the refugees ' own countries .
however , this will be a long and arduous process . spain and senegal agreed to work on stemming the flow of immigration on tuesday , but failed to sign a formal repatriation agreement .
the main reason many africans want to leave is due to extreme poverty .
niger ’ s foreign ministry says this is the real problem that must be tackled to stop migration . spanish policy is to deport all migrants who don ’ t meet asylum conditions .
however , those with no identification , or from countries that have no deportation accord with madrid , often simply end up moving elsewhere in europe . spain ’ s foreign minister has complained that the bureaucracy of the system means he is constantly required to sign new deportation agreements with african countries .
but human rights groups are warning against any mass deportation policy , which they claim legitimate asylum seekers could also get caught up in . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tighter eu borders forcing refugees to take bigger risks with every new influx of refugees from africa , the eu is under increased pressure .
help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security .
-lrb- march 23 , 2006 -rrb- spain , france join forces on immigration spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month .

the aid will include setting up naval and air patrols . the offer came after autonomous spanish authorities in the canary islands called on madrid and the european union for help . " we can not solve problems overnight , however we are very willing and committed to assist the spanish government in our best possible ways , either with financial means -lrb- or -rrb- operationally , " an eu spokesman said . his comments came as spanish and eu officials held talks in brussels late tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of refugees are estimated to die in sea crossings about 7,500 illegal immigrants have landed in the canaries this year , with some 2,000 africans reaching the islands this month alone .
that compares with 4,751 for the whole of last year , and 8,500 in 2004 . ' a european problem ' the incredible rise in illegal immigrant numbers comes as a result of moves by morocco and spain to block easier migration routes into europe .
now , the migrants leave from the west sahara , mauritania and senegal , often packed into small fishing boats .
spain 's deputy prime minister , maria-teresa fernandez de la vega , said the whole of europe should take responsibility for the problem . “ it ’ s clear that this is not just a problem which affects spain , but one that concerns the whole of europe .
it ’ s a difficult situation , which affects millions of people trying to leave their continent .
we have to approach the migration problem from different angles : cooperation with the refugees ' countries of origin , development aid and regulating the influx to europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa fernandez de la vega initially , frontex , eu 's expert border-control agency in poland , will be sent in to advise spanish border guards .
they are also to construct a coordination point in the canary islands .
and eu justice and interior affairs commissioner franco frattini said spain can also expect back-up from other eu states . “ in two weeks we will be able to call upon member states , " said frattini .
" already eight have come forward who are ready to provide rapid offshore vessels and reconnaissance planes . " pledge from brussels the aim is to locate and detain vessels as they are leaving the african coast .
spain says the eu has also proposed setting up reception centers for immigrants who arrive in the canaries .
brussels has also pledged some 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in aid to madrid to cope with the refugees . spain 's fernandez de la vega was due to hold further talks on the problem with european commission president jose manuel barroso , external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , justice commissioner franco frattini and the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : " after those meetings i think we will have a very good view on what it is the spanish government would like the european union , particularly the commission , to do , " said an eu spokesman . " we would then have a best overview of the measures requested and we could then obviously devise our own response to this , " he said . looking at africa the problem must also be addressed in africa itself .
in the long-term , the eu says it will work to improve the situation in the refugees ' own countries .
however , this will be a long and arduous process . spain and senegal agreed to work on stemming the flow of immigration on tuesday , but failed to sign a formal repatriation agreement .
the main reason many africans want to leave is due to extreme poverty .
niger ’ s foreign ministry says this is the real problem that must be tackled to stop migration . spanish policy is to deport all migrants who don ’ t meet asylum conditions .
however , those with no identification , or from countries that have no deportation accord with madrid , often simply end up moving elsewhere in europe . spain ’ s foreign minister has complained that the bureaucracy of the system means he is constantly required to sign new deportation agreements with african countries .
but human rights groups are warning against any mass deportation policy , which they claim legitimate asylum seekers could also get caught up in . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tighter eu borders forcing refugees to take bigger risks with every new influx of refugees from africa , the eu is under increased pressure .

experts say her style will increase germany 's clout . german chancellor angela merkel is setting a clear course when it comes to human rights . " this is an issue that is being supported from the top and it is significant that this is the case , " said günter nooke , the german government 's human rights representative . he said the differences between merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder were " self-evident . "
schröder , who had a very close relationship to russian president vladimir putin , had called the leader a " flawless democrat . "
merkel , on the other hand , addressed sensitive issues such as chechnya when she went to moscow in january . she also broached the delicate subject of the us prison camp at guantanamo bay before and during her inaugural visit to washington in january . no n eed to schmooze i n chi n a eberhard sandschneider , director of the german council on foreign relations ' research institute , said he was n't surprised that merkel had talked about human rights concerns while in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that at least 8,000 people get the death penalty in china each year " it is n't astonishing , as human rights are always an issue when one of our politicians goes to china , " sandschneider said .
" this sends a signal at home . " but merkel 's course was more positive than schröder 's , sandschneider said . " we finally have someone who recognizes that china does n't need to be schmoozed , " he said .
" rather , a common base needs to be found and we can go from there .
they can handle the criticism . " merkel is a tough but ho n est part n er merkel said at the end of her china visit that the country " still had deficits in human rights . " the chinese are tough negotiators , " merkel told german television zdf .
" so we have to counter just as toughly and make clear that we do n't have anything to give away . " this style of dialogue was by no means detrimental to international ties , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush praised merkel as a " clear thinker " " an interesting partner is someone who has their own opinion , " nooke said .
" the fact that there are differences of opinion does n't make us any less interesting . " merkel 's criticism of human rights issues in beijing , moscow and washington have been positively received on the international stage .
sandschneider said this was because she came across authentically . " she has an honest and straightforward manner and people value this , " sandschneider said . the first step i n a lo n g process human rights organizations have welcomed merkel 's course .
beate wagner from the human rights forum 's -lrb- hrf -rrb- coordination group said there had been a consistent upgrading of human rights under merkel .
the hrf is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . " human rights issues have been explicitly well positioned on her inaugural visits , " said wagner , who is also secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
she said this marked an " improvement " to the schröder government and was a first step . " now , more work needs to be done , " wagner said .
" we 'll have to see how much gets implemented in bilateral relations .
but we are positively looking forward to see what happens next . " of course , experts agree that merkel 's criticism will not solve problems overnight . " you ca n't have the illusion that one government is going to make a difference , " wagner said .
" but it is part of an international climate , which can exert pressure . " germa n y should use its i n ter n atio n al role i n 2007 in january , germany will take over the six-month rotating presidency of the council of the european union .
it will also hold the g8 presidency in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will chair the council of the european union for the first half of 2007 wagner said germany could use these positions to increase international pressure regarding human rights . " it can set impulses in un meetings , for example , when it has the voice as head of the european council , " she said . nooke said he was interested in keeping human rights on the agenda in the european council next year . " it is important that europe pull together and carry weight in international bodies , " nooke said .
" we have to have the courage to address critical issues .
it can be that someone may not be happy with this , but in the medium and long term , it 's worth it .

"
conservative values have been making a comeback among germany 's youth in recent years .
but parents punished with obstreperous offspring can not always relay on the help of authorities , as one mother had to find out . hildesheim in northern germany is n't exactly known as hedonist central .
the city of about 100,000 people takes pride in its architectural gems , such as " one of the world 's prettiest " market squares and two religious buildings that have been included in the unesco 's list of world cultural heritage sites : st. michaelis ' church and the city 's cathedral , where hildesheimers flock each year to admire the blossoming rose tree , which allegedly was planted more than 1,000 years ago . the city has come up with cute little cartoons to gently remind people that they 'll have to pay 50 euros -lrb- $ 64 -rrb- for dropping a chewing gum on the street or that not cleaning up after their dogs will set them back double that amount .
germany 's snoring museum is actually not located in hildesheim proper , but in a little town nearby . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : appearances deceive : despite the serenity of st. michaelis , not all is well in hildesheim but all this can not deter from the fact that not all is well in hildesheim as far as morals are concerned : some of the city 's young ladies appear to engage in absolutely inappropriate behavior when it comes to their relationships with men . one virtuous hildesheimer mother now recently decided to put a stop to her daughter 's indecent philandering .
she called the city 's youth services department and complained to officials about her child 's mä n n ergeschichte n , which literally translates to " men tales . " given the nature of the complaint , asking about the daughter 's age probably seemed like a reasonable thing to do . " she 's 68 , " the 92-year-old mother told youth service officials , who responded that the daughter was about half a century too old to fall under their jurisdiction .
instead , they dispatched a team of police officers to the mother 's home .
law enforcement officials apparently managed to end the fight between the couple . reports that the daughter 's been grounded for the next four weeks could not be confirmed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's graying gangsters criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .

european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good . the united states is trying to rally its partners behind plans to build a missile shield but many in europe , where some of the network would be based , remain skeptical , defense analysts say . the system , which will consist of 10 antimissile interceptors - rockets designed to shoot down incoming missiles - is scheduled to be ready by 2011 .
it will be integrated into a broader american missile defense system that is designed to protect the us homeland - not europe , per se . iran , deep in conflict with the west over its nuclear program , announced in april that it had tested a new generation of medium-range missile featuring multiple warheads and radar-evading technology . the pentagon says that no decision has been taken yet about where on the old continent the missile defense system might be located . " we expect these consultations will continue in the coming weeks and months with countries that have expressed an interest , " pentagon spokesman bryan whitman told reporters in washington on monday . a difference in perception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a necessity , some as a space wars fantasy some experts suggest the plans have run up against different visions of what constitutes a threat on either side of the atlantic . " there is a difference in perception , " said andrew brookes of the london-based international institute for strategic studies . " america is looking at protection from strategic missile attacks from places like china , north korea and iran .
europe does n't believe that 's a threat . " " europeans , inherently , do n't buy into this fantasy , " brookes said . the plans are the latest chapter in the development of an anti-missile program , initially attempted at great cost under us president ronald reagan during the cold war .
the current system is no longer aimed at russia , rather its aimed at so-called " rogue states " - and is specifically designed to counter a potential nuclear strike from iran . at nato headquarters , officials refused to publicly comment on the us plans . " the us took a political decision to go ahead with the deployment of a missile defense system years ago whereas europe has n't had that discussion , " one nato source said , adding that washington is " forging ahead . " possible scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful radar on its way to a us base in alaska the debate may not yet have taken place , but the 26 members of nato have in hand a 10,000-page feasibility study setting out the case for a missile shield and the possible scenarios in which one might be useful . ordered by nato leaders in prague in 2002 , the text has not been discussed at political level yet , but the united states is pushing its allies to debate the subject at the next alliance summit in riga , latvia in november . " there is a growing threat of long-range missile attack on nato territory and it is timely to examine ways and means of addressing that threat , " said marshall billingslea , head of nato 's conference of national armaments directors , announcing that the report had been completed . europe remains cautious europe is , nevertheless , unlikely to act too hastily . " on the european side , there is an almost categorical refusal to take decisions on the run , " said rik coolsaet of the royal institute of international relations in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us sees iran as a more immediate threat " politically , europeans understand that there is a potential danger from the iranians , but it is not a danger they see likely in the short term .
the sense of urgency is far less present in europe than in the united states , " coolsaet said . another obstacle to accepting the us plan is that it remains to be seen whether such a missile shield can actually work . former head of the pentagon 's office of operational test and evaluation says the interceptors have n't " had a successful intercept test for 4 years . "
but the pentagon has brushed this aside saying the " technical problems " are not " show stoppers . " " we are being asked - us , the europeans - to make a huge investment to buy a program which , even in the united states , is not believed to be ready , " coolsaet said . no way some observers would go as far as saying that the basic premise of the anti-missile program is essentially flawed . " i do n't see any evidence that the iranians are producing a weapon that can reach new york , " brookes said .
" i do n't see any evidence that if they had such a weapon , they would even in their wildest dreams contemplate using it given the massive preponderance of retaliatory capability the united states has . " according to brookes , it is more important to focus on current rather than potential threats . " we have to focus on the threat that really matters , and what matters at present is defending troops that might be deployed rather than defending berlin against a perception of a threat , " he said . " german politicians , french politicians and british politicians do not regard pyongyang as about to launch anything in the foreseeable future at a european capital , " brookes said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.05.2006 europe skeptical about us missile shield plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not entirely clear if the us missile defense system would actually benefit europe as tensions grow over iran 's nuclear program , the us is allegedly moving to locate a missile defense system in europe .
european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good . the united states is trying to rally its partners behind plans to build a missile shield but many in europe , where some of the network would be based , remain skeptical , defense analysts say . the system , which will consist of 10 antimissile interceptors - rockets designed to shoot down incoming missiles - is scheduled to be ready by 2011 .
it will be integrated into a broader american missile defense system that is designed to protect the us homeland - not europe , per se . iran , deep in conflict with the west over its nuclear program , announced in april that it had tested a new generation of medium-range missile featuring multiple warheads and radar-evading technology . the pentagon says that no decision has been taken yet about where on the old continent the missile defense system might be located . " we expect these consultations will continue in the coming weeks and months with countries that have expressed an interest , " pentagon spokesman bryan whitman told reporters in washington on monday . a difference in perception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a necessity , some as a space wars fantasy some experts suggest the plans have run up against different visions of what constitutes a threat on either side of the atlantic . " there is a difference in perception , " said andrew brookes of the london-based international institute for strategic studies . " america is looking at protection from strategic missile attacks from places like china , north korea and iran .
europe does n't believe that 's a threat . " " europeans , inherently , do n't buy into this fantasy , " brookes said . the plans are the latest chapter in the development of an anti-missile program , initially attempted at great cost under us president ronald reagan during the cold war .
the current system is no longer aimed at russia , rather its aimed at so-called " rogue states " - and is specifically designed to counter a potential nuclear strike from iran . at nato headquarters , officials refused to publicly comment on the us plans . " the us took a political decision to go ahead with the deployment of a missile defense system years ago whereas europe has n't had that discussion , " one nato source said , adding that washington is " forging ahead . " possible scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful radar on its way to a us base in alaska the debate may not yet have taken place , but the 26 members of nato have in hand a 10,000-page feasibility study setting out the case for a missile shield and the possible scenarios in which one might be useful . ordered by nato leaders in prague in 2002 , the text has not been discussed at political level yet , but the united states is pushing its allies to debate the subject at the next alliance summit in riga , latvia in november . " there is a growing threat of long-range missile attack on nato territory and it is timely to examine ways and means of addressing that threat , " said marshall billingslea , head of nato 's conference of national armaments directors , announcing that the report had been completed . europe remains cautious europe is , nevertheless , unlikely to act too hastily .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.05.2006 europe skeptical about us missile shield plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not entirely clear if the us missile defense system would actually benefit europe as tensions grow over iran 's nuclear program , the us is allegedly moving to locate a missile defense system in europe .
european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good . the united states is trying to rally its partners behind plans to build a missile shield but many in europe , where some of the network would be based , remain skeptical , defense analysts say . the system , which will consist of 10 antimissile interceptors - rockets designed to shoot down incoming missiles - is scheduled to be ready by 2011 .
it will be integrated into a broader american missile defense system that is designed to protect the us homeland - not europe , per se . iran , deep in conflict with the west over its nuclear program , announced in april that it had tested a new generation of medium-range missile featuring multiple warheads and radar-evading technology . the pentagon says that no decision has been taken yet about where on the old continent the missile defense system might be located . " we expect these consultations will continue in the coming weeks and months with countries that have expressed an interest , " pentagon spokesman bryan whitman told reporters in washington on monday . a difference in perception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a necessity , some as a space wars fantasy some experts suggest the plans have run up against different visions of what constitutes a threat on either side of the atlantic . " there is a difference in perception , " said andrew brookes of the london-based international institute for strategic studies . " america is looking at protection from strategic missile attacks from places like china , north korea and iran .
europe does n't believe that 's a threat . " " europeans , inherently , do n't buy into this fantasy , " brookes said . the plans are the latest chapter in the development of an anti-missile program , initially attempted at great cost under us president ronald reagan during the cold war .
the current system is no longer aimed at russia , rather its aimed at so-called " rogue states " - and is specifically designed to counter a potential nuclear strike from iran . at nato headquarters , officials refused to publicly comment on the us plans . " the us took a political decision to go ahead with the deployment of a missile defense system years ago whereas europe has n't had that discussion , " one nato source said , adding that washington is " forging ahead . " possible scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful radar on its way to a us base in alaska the debate may not yet have taken place , but the 26 members of nato have in hand a 10,000-page feasibility study setting out the case for a missile shield and the possible scenarios in which one might be useful . ordered by nato leaders in prague in 2002 , the text has not been discussed at political level yet , but the united states is pushing its allies to debate the subject at the next alliance summit in riga , latvia in november . " there is a growing threat of long-range missile attack on nato territory and it is timely to examine ways and means of addressing that threat , " said marshall billingslea , head of nato 's conference of national armaments directors , announcing that the report had been completed . europe remains cautious europe is , nevertheless , unlikely to act too hastily . " on the european side , there is an almost categorical refusal to take decisions on the run , " said rik coolsaet of the royal institute of international relations in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us sees iran as a more immediate threat " politically , europeans understand that there is a potential danger from the iranians , but it is not a danger they see likely in the short term .
the sense of urgency is far less present in europe than in the united states , " coolsaet said . another obstacle to accepting the us plan is that it remains to be seen whether such a missile shield can actually work . former head of the pentagon 's office of operational test and evaluation says the interceptors have n't " had a successful intercept test for 4 years . "
but the pentagon has brushed this aside saying the " technical problems " are not " show stoppers . " " we are being asked - us , the europeans - to make a huge investment to buy a program which , even in the united states , is not believed to be ready , " coolsaet said . no way some observers would go as far as saying that the basic premise of the anti-missile program is essentially flawed . " i do n't see any evidence that the iranians are producing a weapon that can reach new york , " brookes said .
" i do n't see any evidence that if they had such a weapon , they would even in their wildest dreams contemplate using it given the massive preponderance of retaliatory capability the united states has . " according to brookes , it is more important to focus on current rather than potential threats . " we have to focus on the threat that really matters , and what matters at present is defending troops that might be deployed rather than defending berlin against a perception of a threat , " he said . " german politicians , french politicians and british politicians do not regard pyongyang as about to launch anything in the foreseeable future at a european capital , " brookes said .

experts say her style will increase germany 's clout . german chancellor angela merkel is setting a clear course when it comes to human rights . " this is an issue that is being supported from the top and it is significant that this is the case , " said günter nooke , the german government 's human rights representative . he said the differences between merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder were " self-evident . "
schröder , who had a very close relationship to russian president vladimir putin , had called the leader a " flawless democrat . "
merkel , on the other hand , addressed sensitive issues such as chechnya when she went to moscow in january . she also broached the delicate subject of the us prison camp at guantanamo bay before and during her inaugural visit to washington in january . no n eed to schmooze i n chi n a eberhard sandschneider , director of the german council on foreign relations ' research institute , said he was n't surprised that merkel had talked about human rights concerns while in beijing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts estimate that at least 8,000 people get the death penalty in china each year " it is n't astonishing , as human rights are always an issue when one of our politicians goes to china , " sandschneider said .
" this sends a signal at home . " but merkel 's course was more positive than schröder 's , sandschneider said . " we finally have someone who recognizes that china does n't need to be schmoozed , " he said .
" rather , a common base needs to be found and we can go from there .
they can handle the criticism . " merkel is a tough but ho n est part n er merkel said at the end of her china visit that the country " still had deficits in human rights . " the chinese are tough negotiators , " merkel told german television zdf .
" so we have to counter just as toughly and make clear that we do n't have anything to give away . " this style of dialogue was by no means detrimental to international ties , nooke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush praised merkel as a " clear thinker " " an interesting partner is someone who has their own opinion , " nooke said .
" the fact that there are differences of opinion does n't make us any less interesting . " merkel 's criticism of human rights issues in beijing , moscow and washington have been positively received on the international stage .
sandschneider said this was because she came across authentically . " she has an honest and straightforward manner and people value this , " sandschneider said . the first step i n a lo n g process human rights organizations have welcomed merkel 's course .
beate wagner from the human rights forum 's -lrb- hrf -rrb- coordination group said there had been a consistent upgrading of human rights under merkel .
the hrf is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . " human rights issues have been explicitly well positioned on her inaugural visits , " said wagner , who is also secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
she said this marked an " improvement " to the schröder government and was a first step . " now , more work needs to be done , " wagner said .
" we 'll have to see how much gets implemented in bilateral relations .
but we are positively looking forward to see what happens next . " of course , experts agree that merkel 's criticism will not solve problems overnight . " you ca n't have the illusion that one government is going to make a difference , " wagner said .
" but it is part of an international climate , which can exert pressure . " germa n y should use its i n ter n atio n al role i n 2007 in january , germany will take over the six-month rotating presidency of the council of the european union .
it will also hold the g8 presidency in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will chair the council of the european union for the first half of 2007 wagner said germany could use these positions to increase international pressure regarding human rights . " it can set impulses in un meetings , for example , when it has the voice as head of the european council , " she said . nooke said he was interested in keeping human rights on the agenda in the european council next year . " it is important that europe pull together and carry weight in international bodies , " nooke said .
" we have to have the courage to address critical issues .
it can be that someone may not be happy with this , but in the medium and long term , it 's worth it .

they are now facing fines of up to 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,000 -rrb- or prison sentences of up to three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edonkey is not the only piece of software which enables peer-to-peer data sharing " this was the largest action against illegal file-sharing offers on the internet that has ever been carried out in germany , " said public prosecutor jürgen krautkremer . illegal file sharing is usually thought of as the favorite pastime of the younger generation of internet users , but the state-wide , coordinated swoop by the german police reveals a different story . " contrary to popular belief , -lrb- illegal file sharing -rrb- is by no means about young people only , " krautkremer said . people of all ages were found to be engaged in illegal , copyright-violating activities . an internet hunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry feels crippled by internet piracy a couple of months ago , according to krautkremer , investigators started monitoring a server located in the german city of hürth , southwest of cologne .
the server , whose owners are not being prosecuted , was itself connected to the edonkey peer-to-peer network for data exchange . using a special piece of software , developed by the international federation of phonographic industry , the investigators profiled and analyzed some 800,000 records , including a 14-gigabyte log file which contained around 40,000 internet addresses . individual users were identified with the help of internet providers , and search warrants were issued for those users who could be proved to have shared more than 500 files or , approximately , 25 to 30 cds during the period under observation . positive reactions the music industry greeted the outcome of the police action in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.05.2006 eu pledges aid to spain on african migrant problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of african immigrants has soared since policies were changed the european union has offered to help spain deal with a wave of illegal immigrants abandoning africa for the canary islands .
the aid will include setting up naval and air patrols . the offer came after autonomous spanish authorities in the canary islands called on madrid and the european union for help . " we can not solve problems overnight , however we are very willing and committed to assist the spanish government in our best possible ways , either with financial means -lrb- or -rrb- operationally , " an eu spokesman said . his comments came as spanish and eu officials held talks in brussels late tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of refugees are estimated to die in sea crossings about 7,500 illegal immigrants have landed in the canaries this year , with some 2,000 africans reaching the islands this month alone .
that compares with 4,751 for the whole of last year , and 8,500 in 2004 . ' a european problem ' the incredible rise in illegal immigrant numbers comes as a result of moves by morocco and spain to block easier migration routes into europe .
now , the migrants leave from the west sahara , mauritania and senegal , often packed into small fishing boats .
spain 's deputy prime minister , maria-teresa fernandez de la vega , said the whole of europe should take responsibility for the problem . “ it ’ s clear that this is not just a problem which affects spain , but one that concerns the whole of europe .
it ’ s a difficult situation , which affects millions of people trying to leave their continent .
we have to approach the migration problem from different angles : cooperation with the refugees ' countries of origin , development aid and regulating the influx to europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa fernandez de la vega initially , frontex , eu 's expert border-control agency in poland , will be sent in to advise spanish border guards .
they are also to construct a coordination point in the canary islands .
and eu justice and interior affairs commissioner franco frattini said spain can also expect back-up from other eu states . “ in two weeks we will be able to call upon member states , " said frattini .
" already eight have come forward who are ready to provide rapid offshore vessels and reconnaissance planes . " pledge from brussels the aim is to locate and detain vessels as they are leaving the african coast .
spain says the eu has also proposed setting up reception centers for immigrants who arrive in the canaries .
brussels has also pledged some 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in aid to madrid to cope with the refugees . spain 's fernandez de la vega was due to hold further talks on the problem with european commission president jose manuel barroso , external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , justice commissioner franco frattini and the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : " after those meetings i think we will have a very good view on what it is the spanish government would like the european union , particularly the commission , to do , " said an eu spokesman . " we would then have a best overview of the measures requested and we could then obviously devise our own response to this , " he said . looking at africa the problem must also be addressed in africa itself .
in the long-term , the eu says it will work to improve the situation in the refugees ' own countries .
however , this will be a long and arduous process . spain and senegal agreed to work on stemming the flow of immigration on tuesday , but failed to sign a formal repatriation agreement .
the main reason many africans want to leave is due to extreme poverty .
niger ’ s foreign ministry says this is the real problem that must be tackled to stop migration . spanish policy is to deport all migrants who don ’ t meet asylum conditions .
however , those with no identification , or from countries that have no deportation accord with madrid , often simply end up moving elsewhere in europe . spain ’ s foreign minister has complained that the bureaucracy of the system means he is constantly required to sign new deportation agreements with african countries .
but human rights groups are warning against any mass deportation policy , which they claim legitimate asylum seekers could also get caught up in . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tighter eu borders forcing refugees to take bigger risks with every new influx of refugees from africa , the eu is under increased pressure .
help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security .
-lrb- march 23 , 2006 -rrb- spain , france join forces on immigration spain and france have announced that they will propose a joint plan for a european-african conference on immigration at a european union summit later this month .
-lrb- oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.05.2006 europe skeptical about us missile shield plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not entirely clear if the us missile defense system would actually benefit europe as tensions grow over iran 's nuclear program , the us is allegedly moving to locate a missile defense system in europe .
european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good . the united states is trying to rally its partners behind plans to build a missile shield but many in europe , where some of the network would be based , remain skeptical , defense analysts say . the system , which will consist of 10 antimissile interceptors - rockets designed to shoot down incoming missiles - is scheduled to be ready by 2011 .
it will be integrated into a broader american missile defense system that is designed to protect the us homeland - not europe , per se . iran , deep in conflict with the west over its nuclear program , announced in april that it had tested a new generation of medium-range missile featuring multiple warheads and radar-evading technology . the pentagon says that no decision has been taken yet about where on the old continent the missile defense system might be located . " we expect these consultations will continue in the coming weeks and months with countries that have expressed an interest , " pentagon spokesman bryan whitman told reporters in washington on monday . a difference in perception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a necessity , some as a space wars fantasy some experts suggest the plans have run up against different visions of what constitutes a threat on either side of the atlantic . " there is a difference in perception , " said andrew brookes of the london-based international institute for strategic studies . " america is looking at protection from strategic missile attacks from places like china , north korea and iran .
europe does n't believe that 's a threat . " " europeans , inherently , do n't buy into this fantasy , " brookes said . the plans are the latest chapter in the development of an anti-missile program , initially attempted at great cost under us president ronald reagan during the cold war .
the current system is no longer aimed at russia , rather its aimed at so-called " rogue states " - and is specifically designed to counter a potential nuclear strike from iran . at nato headquarters , officials refused to publicly comment on the us plans . " the us took a political decision to go ahead with the deployment of a missile defense system years ago whereas europe has n't had that discussion , " one nato source said , adding that washington is " forging ahead . " possible scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful radar on its way to a us base in alaska the debate may not yet have taken place , but the 26 members of nato have in hand a 10,000-page feasibility study setting out the case for a missile shield and the possible scenarios in which one might be useful . ordered by nato leaders in prague in 2002 , the text has not been discussed at political level yet , but the united states is pushing its allies to debate the subject at the next alliance summit in riga , latvia in november . " there is a growing threat of long-range missile attack on nato territory and it is timely to examine ways and means of addressing that threat , " said marshall billingslea , head of nato 's conference of national armaments directors , announcing that the report had been completed . europe remains cautious europe is , nevertheless , unlikely to act too hastily . " on the european side , there is an almost categorical refusal to take decisions on the run , " said rik coolsaet of the royal institute of international relations in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us sees iran as a more immediate threat " politically , europeans understand that there is a potential danger from the iranians , but it is not a danger they see likely in the short term .
the sense of urgency is far less present in europe than in the united states , " coolsaet said . another obstacle to accepting the us plan is that it remains to be seen whether such a missile shield can actually work . former head of the pentagon 's office of operational test and evaluation says the interceptors have n't " had a successful intercept test for 4 years . "
but the pentagon has brushed this aside saying the " technical problems " are not " show stoppers . " " we are being asked - us , the europeans - to make a huge investment to buy a program which , even in the united states , is not believed to be ready , " coolsaet said . no way some observers would go as far as saying that the basic premise of the anti-missile program is essentially flawed . " i do n't see any evidence that the iranians are producing a weapon that can reach new york , " brookes said .
" i do n't see any evidence that if they had such a weapon , they would even in their wildest dreams contemplate using it given the massive preponderance of retaliatory capability the united states has . " according to brookes , it is more important to focus on current rather than potential threats . " we have to focus on the threat that really matters , and what matters at present is defending troops that might be deployed rather than defending berlin against a perception of a threat , " he said . " german politicians , french politicians and british politicians do not regard pyongyang as about to launch anything in the foreseeable future at a european capital , " brookes said .
" they just do n't .

european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good . the united states is trying to rally its partners behind plans to build a missile shield but many in europe , where some of the network would be based , remain skeptical , defense analysts say . the system , which will consist of 10 antimissile interceptors - rockets designed to shoot down incoming missiles - is scheduled to be ready by 2011 .
it will be integrated into a broader american missile defense system that is designed to protect the us homeland - not europe , per se . iran , deep in conflict with the west over its nuclear program , announced in april that it had tested a new generation of medium-range missile featuring multiple warheads and radar-evading technology . the pentagon says that no decision has been taken yet about where on the old continent the missile defense system might be located . " we expect these consultations will continue in the coming weeks and months with countries that have expressed an interest , " pentagon spokesman bryan whitman told reporters in washington on monday . a difference in perception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a necessity , some as a space wars fantasy some experts suggest the plans have run up against different visions of what constitutes a threat on either side of the atlantic . " there is a difference in perception , " said andrew brookes of the london-based international institute for strategic studies . " america is looking at protection from strategic missile attacks from places like china , north korea and iran .
europe does n't believe that 's a threat . " " europeans , inherently , do n't buy into this fantasy , " brookes said . the plans are the latest chapter in the development of an anti-missile program , initially attempted at great cost under us president ronald reagan during the cold war .
the current system is no longer aimed at russia , rather its aimed at so-called " rogue states " - and is specifically designed to counter a potential nuclear strike from iran . at nato headquarters , officials refused to publicly comment on the us plans . " the us took a political decision to go ahead with the deployment of a missile defense system years ago whereas europe has n't had that discussion , " one nato source said , adding that washington is " forging ahead . " possible scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful radar on its way to a us base in alaska the debate may not yet have taken place , but the 26 members of nato have in hand a 10,000-page feasibility study setting out the case for a missile shield and the possible scenarios in which one might be useful . ordered by nato leaders in prague in 2002 , the text has not been discussed at political level yet , but the united states is pushing its allies to debate the subject at the next alliance summit in riga , latvia in november . " there is a growing threat of long-range missile attack on nato territory and it is timely to examine ways and means of addressing that threat , " said marshall billingslea , head of nato 's conference of national armaments directors , announcing that the report had been completed . europe remains cautious europe is , nevertheless , unlikely to act too hastily . " on the european side , there is an almost categorical refusal to take decisions on the run , " said rik coolsaet of the royal institute of international relations in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us sees iran as a more immediate threat " politically , europeans understand that there is a potential danger from the iranians , but it is not a danger they see likely in the short term .
the sense of urgency is far less present in europe than in the united states , " coolsaet said . another obstacle to accepting the us plan is that it remains to be seen whether such a missile shield can actually work . former head of the pentagon 's office of operational test and evaluation says the interceptors have n't " had a successful intercept test for 4 years . "
but the pentagon has brushed this aside saying the " technical problems " are not " show stoppers . " " we are being asked - us , the europeans - to make a huge investment to buy a program which , even in the united states , is not believed to be ready , " coolsaet said . no way some observers would go as far as saying that the basic premise of the anti-missile program is essentially flawed . " i do n't see any evidence that the iranians are producing a weapon that can reach new york , " brookes said .
" i do n't see any evidence that if they had such a weapon , they would even in their wildest dreams contemplate using it given the massive preponderance of retaliatory capability the united states has . " according to brookes , it is more important to focus on current rather than potential threats . " we have to focus on the threat that really matters , and what matters at present is defending troops that might be deployed rather than defending berlin against a perception of a threat , " he said . " german politicians , french politicians and british politicians do not regard pyongyang as about to launch anything in the foreseeable future at a european capital , " brookes said .

at the same time , a spate of racist attacks has germany fearing for its hard-won reputation for tolerance . the men were released after a month in police custody on tuesday because they were no longer under " strong suspicion " of beating the ethiopian-born engineer into a coma .
two men had attacked ermyas m. in april in potsdam , outside berlin , and called him a " dirty nigger . "
according to the federal prosecutor 's office , which took over the case after it attracted wide media coverage , the victim does n't remember having been beaten up and ca n't identify the attackers .
the two men remain under investigation , the prosecutor 's office said . federal prosecutor kay nehm has said he believes the attack was motivated by xenophobia . the men 's release from custody made headlines throughout the country in the midst of an impassioned public discussion about xenophobia in germany .
the alarm was sounded last week by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go , " said heye , referring to the state surrounding the capital ..
they might not make it out alive . " heye , now a spokesman for an anti-racism lobby , was not alone in warning of xenophobic pockets in the former communist east , where the country 's neo-nazi party has found a following among unemployed youths . the africa council , a group for expatriates , plans to publish a " no-go-area " brochure listing clubs , bars and restaurants in and around berlin which should give black soccer fans a wide berth . politician attacked but politicians and football authorities said heye 's statement scored an own goal for a country , which has painstakingly confronted its nazi past to earn a reputation for political correctness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sayan was attacked over the weekend over the weekend , the debate took another turn when a german politician of turkish origin was beaten and his head slashed with a broken bottle in lichtenberg , a working class part of berlin known as a neo-nazi stronghold .
the two men who attacked giyasettin sayan , a regional parliamentarian for the neo-communist left party , called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack justified last week 's warnings . the premier of brandenburg , matthias platzeck , on sunday admitted that xenophobia was a problem in the state . " we have to accept that it is not a problem that can be resolved from one day to the next , " he said .
" we have gone through a phase where we minimized and denied the problem , where we said : ' my god , if we speak about this openly we will hurt our image and then nobody will come here ' . " in early january , a 12-year-old boy of ethiopian origin was attacked by a group of neo-nazi youths who forced him at gun-point to lick their boots in the eastern town of magdeburg .
they were jailed this week by a judge who said the color of the victim 's skin was " the sole reason " for the attack .
fear of tarnished image the debate about whether racism is on the rise and the damage it could do has peaked less than three weeks before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , with about one million foreign fans expected to attend the tournament .
the government has been running a campaign to promote germany as an open , friendly society in the hope that those who come will return one day . the leader of the greens , claudia roth , said there was no point in hushing the debate for fear of scaring off foreigners , as recent events spoke for themselves . " it is not talking about the far-right that threatens to harm our reputation but the very facts themselves .
these are not lone incidents , but that we have a widespread , deep-seated problem with right-wing extremist violence in our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi attacks have increased in germany over the weekend , bild newspaper leaked an extract of a government report stating that the number of neo-nazis in germany had grown from 3,800 in 2004 to 4,200 last year .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble released statistics on monday saying that the number of violent crimes attributed to the far-right had risen by 23 percent in 2005 . wilhelm heitmeyer , a sociologist at the university of bielefeld , blamed the poor state of the economy and the frustration it created for animosity towards foreigners . " it is a german problem , though there is a stronger tendency in the east , " heitmeyer told the news agency afp .
" it has to do with the fear of social decline , which is greater there .

and just ahead of the talks , a report emerged of differences of opinion within the us administration over strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice , speaking at a meeting on iran 's nuclear policies , in march us secretary of state condoleezza rice had " gone out on a limb " to back the european package of trade and technology incentives but had met resistance from vice-president dick cheney , the financial times newspaper reported . cheney is said to be against the idea of " rewarding bad behavior " after iran allegedly breached its nuclear safeguards commitments , according to the newspaper report based on comments from diplomats and analysts . it said that the divisions were complicating the eu proposal that world powers support iran 's building of several light water reactors , set up a nuclear fuel bank , and have the united states drop restrictions on iran 's buying of us commercial airplanes , if tehran takes steps to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons . but if tehran does not do this , sanctions should follow , including an arms embargo , according to the proposal . russia supports eu plan the newspaper said some european diplomats think the us will back their proposals if russia supports a tough un resolution that would require iran to suspend uranium enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministesr lavrov -lrb- left -rrb- met german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in april to discuss the iran issue during a tour of arab gulf countries kuwait and qatar on tuesday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said moscow supports the eu proposal and urged tehran to cooperate . asked if russia would back military action against iran if the proposed negotiations collapsed , lavrov declined to answer but insisted that moscow does not support the use of force " in principle . " the united states , britain , france , china and russia are the five permanent members of the un security council , which has the power to endorse sanctions or us military strikes , an option which is nonetheless broadly opposed . iran 's hardline government has already rejected the european offer and insisted its uranium enrichment program is not up for negotiation .
in tehran earlier , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad boasted that the islamic republic had " mastered the entire nuclear fuel cycle " and that it would give an " historic slap " to any attacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general annan urged iran to hear out the latest proposal u.n. secretary-general kofi annan , speaking in vietnam , said he had appealed to iran to reassure the world that its nuclear intentions are peaceful and asked it " not to reject anything out of hand " which might emerge from the talks in london . exercise in futility ? but one eu diplomat said it was hard to see what the meeting , which started around midday , could achieve .
" it 's really just an academic exercise , since the iranians have made it clear that they wo n't accept any offer , " he told reuters news service . the united states has refused to rule out military action . iran says it wants to use the fuel cycle only to make civilian reactor fuel , and argues such work for peaceful purposes is a " right " enshrined by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . but the same technology can be extended to make atomic weapons , and the us in particular claims iran is merely exploiting a loophole in the npt . citing us officials , iranian analysts and foreign diplomats , the washington post newspaper reported wednesday that iran had requested through intermediaries direct talks with washington over its nuclear program . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-3 preparing new incentives for iran while us talks tough the un security council 's five permanent members plus germany are to meet in london to consider new incentives being prepared by european negotiators for iran to renounce its disputed nuclear program .

at the same time , a spate of racist attacks has germany fearing for its hard-won reputation for tolerance . the men were released after a month in police custody on tuesday because they were no longer under " strong suspicion " of beating the ethiopian-born engineer into a coma .
two men had attacked ermyas m. in april in potsdam , outside berlin , and called him a " dirty nigger . "
according to the federal prosecutor 's office , which took over the case after it attracted wide media coverage , the victim does n't remember having been beaten up and ca n't identify the attackers .
the two men remain under investigation , the prosecutor 's office said . federal prosecutor kay nehm has said he believes the attack was motivated by xenophobia . the men 's release from custody made headlines throughout the country in the midst of an impassioned public discussion about xenophobia in germany .
the alarm was sounded last week by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go , " said heye , referring to the state surrounding the capital ..
they might not make it out alive . " heye , now a spokesman for an anti-racism lobby , was not alone in warning of xenophobic pockets in the former communist east , where the country 's neo-nazi party has found a following among unemployed youths . the africa council , a group for expatriates , plans to publish a " no-go-area " brochure listing clubs , bars and restaurants in and around berlin which should give black soccer fans a wide berth . politician attacked but politicians and football authorities said heye 's statement scored an own goal for a country , which has painstakingly confronted its nazi past to earn a reputation for political correctness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sayan was attacked over the weekend over the weekend , the debate took another turn when a german politician of turkish origin was beaten and his head slashed with a broken bottle in lichtenberg , a working class part of berlin known as a neo-nazi stronghold .
the two men who attacked giyasettin sayan , a regional parliamentarian for the neo-communist left party , called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack justified last week 's warnings . the premier of brandenburg , matthias platzeck , on sunday admitted that xenophobia was a problem in the state . " we have to accept that it is not a problem that can be resolved from one day to the next , " he said .
" we have gone through a phase where we minimized and denied the problem , where we said : ' my god , if we speak about this openly we will hurt our image and then nobody will come here ' . " in early january , a 12-year-old boy of ethiopian origin was attacked by a group of neo-nazi youths who forced him at gun-point to lick their boots in the eastern town of magdeburg .
they were jailed this week by a judge who said the color of the victim 's skin was " the sole reason " for the attack .
fear of tarnished image the debate about whether racism is on the rise and the damage it could do has peaked less than three weeks before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , with about one million foreign fans expected to attend the tournament .
the government has been running a campaign to promote germany as an open , friendly society in the hope that those who come will return one day . the leader of the greens , claudia roth , said there was no point in hushing the debate for fear of scaring off foreigners , as recent events spoke for themselves . " it is not talking about the far-right that threatens to harm our reputation but the very facts themselves .
these are not lone incidents , but that we have a widespread , deep-seated problem with right-wing extremist violence in our country . "

interior minister wolfgang schäuble released statistics on monday saying that the number of violent crimes attributed to the far-right had risen by 23 percent in 2005 . wilhelm heitmeyer , a sociologist at the university of bielefeld , blamed the poor state of the economy and the frustration it created for animosity towards foreigners . " it is a german problem , though there is a stronger tendency in the east , " heitmeyer told the news agency afp .

the two men remain under investigation , the prosecutor 's office said . federal prosecutor kay nehm has said he believes the attack was motivated by xenophobia . the men 's release from custody made headlines throughout the country in the midst of an impassioned public discussion about xenophobia in germany .
the alarm was sounded last week by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go , " said heye , referring to the state surrounding the capital ..

the two men who attacked giyasettin sayan , a regional parliamentarian for the neo-communist left party , called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack justified last week 's warnings . the premier of brandenburg , matthias platzeck , on sunday admitted that xenophobia was a problem in the state . " we have to accept that it is not a problem that can be resolved from one day to the next , " he said .
" we have gone through a phase where we minimized and denied the problem , where we said : ' my god , if we speak about this openly we will hurt our image and then nobody will come here ' . " in early january , a 12-year-old boy of ethiopian origin was attacked by a group of neo-nazi youths who forced him at gun-point to lick their boots in the eastern town of magdeburg .
they were jailed this week by a judge who said the color of the victim 's skin was " the sole reason " for the attack .
fear of tarnished image the debate about whether racism is on the rise and the damage it could do has peaked less than three weeks before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , with about one million foreign fans expected to attend the tournament .
the government has been running a campaign to promote germany as an open , friendly society in the hope that those who come will return one day . the leader of the greens , claudia roth , said there was no point in hushing the debate for fear of scaring off foreigners , as recent events spoke for themselves .

"
conservative values have been making a comeback among germany 's youth in recent years .
but parents punished with obstreperous offspring can not always relay on the help of authorities , as one mother had to find out . hildesheim in northern germany is n't exactly known as hedonist central .
the city of about 100,000 people takes pride in its architectural gems , such as " one of the world 's prettiest " market squares and two religious buildings that have been included in the unesco 's list of world cultural heritage sites : st. michaelis ' church and the city 's cathedral , where hildesheimers flock each year to admire the blossoming rose tree , which allegedly was planted more than 1,000 years ago . the city has come up with cute little cartoons to gently remind people that they 'll have to pay 50 euros -lrb- $ 64 -rrb- for dropping a chewing gum on the street or that not cleaning up after their dogs will set them back double that amount .
germany 's snoring museum is actually not located in hildesheim proper , but in a little town nearby . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : appearances deceive : despite the serenity of st. michaelis , not all is well in hildesheim but all this can not deter from the fact that not all is well in hildesheim as far as morals are concerned : some of the city 's young ladies appear to engage in absolutely inappropriate behavior when it comes to their relationships with men . one virtuous hildesheimer mother now recently decided to put a stop to her daughter 's indecent philandering .
she called the city 's youth services department and complained to officials about her child 's mä n n ergeschichte n , which literally translates to " men tales . " given the nature of the complaint , asking about the daughter 's age probably seemed like a reasonable thing to do . " she 's 68 , " the 92-year-old mother told youth service officials , who responded that the daughter was about half a century too old to fall under their jurisdiction .
instead , they dispatched a team of police officers to the mother 's home .
law enforcement officials apparently managed to end the fight between the couple . reports that the daughter 's been grounded for the next four weeks could not be confirmed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's graying gangsters criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .

"
conservative values have been making a comeback among germany 's youth in recent years .
but parents punished with obstreperous offspring can not always relay on the help of authorities , as one mother had to find out . hildesheim in northern germany is n't exactly known as hedonist central .
the city of about 100,000 people takes pride in its architectural gems , such as " one of the world 's prettiest " market squares and two religious buildings that have been included in the unesco 's list of world cultural heritage sites : st. michaelis ' church and the city 's cathedral , where hildesheimers flock each year to admire the blossoming rose tree , which allegedly was planted more than 1,000 years ago . the city has come up with cute little cartoons to gently remind people that they 'll have to pay 50 euros -lrb- $ 64 -rrb- for dropping a chewing gum on the street or that not cleaning up after their dogs will set them back double that amount .
germany 's snoring museum is actually not located in hildesheim proper , but in a little town nearby . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : appearances deceive : despite the serenity of st. michaelis , not all is well in hildesheim but all this can not deter from the fact that not all is well in hildesheim as far as morals are concerned : some of the city 's young ladies appear to engage in absolutely inappropriate behavior when it comes to their relationships with men . one virtuous hildesheimer mother now recently decided to put a stop to her daughter 's indecent philandering .
she called the city 's youth services department and complained to officials about her child 's mä n n ergeschichte n , which literally translates to " men tales . " given the nature of the complaint , asking about the daughter 's age probably seemed like a reasonable thing to do . " she 's 68 , " the 92-year-old mother told youth service officials , who responded that the daughter was about half a century too old to fall under their jurisdiction .
instead , they dispatched a team of police officers to the mother 's home .
law enforcement officials apparently managed to end the fight between the couple . reports that the daughter 's been grounded for the next four weeks could not be confirmed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's graying gangsters criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .

and just ahead of the talks , a report emerged of differences of opinion within the us administration over strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice , speaking at a meeting on iran 's nuclear policies , in march us secretary of state condoleezza rice had " gone out on a limb " to back the european package of trade and technology incentives but had met resistance from vice-president dick cheney , the financial times newspaper reported . cheney is said to be against the idea of " rewarding bad behavior " after iran allegedly breached its nuclear safeguards commitments , according to the newspaper report based on comments from diplomats and analysts . it said that the divisions were complicating the eu proposal that world powers support iran 's building of several light water reactors , set up a nuclear fuel bank , and have the united states drop restrictions on iran 's buying of us commercial airplanes , if tehran takes steps to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons . but if tehran does not do this , sanctions should follow , including an arms embargo , according to the proposal . russia supports eu plan the newspaper said some european diplomats think the us will back their proposals if russia supports a tough un resolution that would require iran to suspend uranium enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministesr lavrov -lrb- left -rrb- met german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in april to discuss the iran issue during a tour of arab gulf countries kuwait and qatar on tuesday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said moscow supports the eu proposal and urged tehran to cooperate . asked if russia would back military action against iran if the proposed negotiations collapsed , lavrov declined to answer but insisted that moscow does not support the use of force " in principle . " the united states , britain , france , china and russia are the five permanent members of the un security council , which has the power to endorse sanctions or us military strikes , an option which is nonetheless broadly opposed . iran 's hardline government has already rejected the european offer and insisted its uranium enrichment program is not up for negotiation .
in tehran earlier , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad boasted that the islamic republic had " mastered the entire nuclear fuel cycle " and that it would give an " historic slap " to any attacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general annan urged iran to hear out the latest proposal u.n. secretary-general kofi annan , speaking in vietnam , said he had appealed to iran to reassure the world that its nuclear intentions are peaceful and asked it " not to reject anything out of hand " which might emerge from the talks in london . exercise in futility ? but one eu diplomat said it was hard to see what the meeting , which started around midday , could achieve .
" it 's really just an academic exercise , since the iranians have made it clear that they wo n't accept any offer , " he told reuters news service . the united states has refused to rule out military action . iran says it wants to use the fuel cycle only to make civilian reactor fuel , and argues such work for peaceful purposes is a " right " enshrined by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . but the same technology can be extended to make atomic weapons , and the us in particular claims iran is merely exploiting a loophole in the npt . citing us officials , iranian analysts and foreign diplomats , the washington post newspaper reported wednesday that iran had requested through intermediaries direct talks with washington over its nuclear program . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-3 preparing new incentives for iran while us talks tough the un security council 's five permanent members plus germany are to meet in london to consider new incentives being prepared by european negotiators for iran to renounce its disputed nuclear program .

" internet piracy has hurt the whole music community in germany , with legitimate sales falling by a third in just five years , " he said . according to ifpi , some 400 million copyright infringing music files were downloaded illegally last year in germany .

at the same time , a spate of racist attacks has germany fearing for its hard-won reputation for tolerance . the men were released after a month in police custody on tuesday because they were no longer under " strong suspicion " of beating the ethiopian-born engineer into a coma .
two men had attacked ermyas m. in april in potsdam , outside berlin , and called him a " dirty nigger . "
according to the federal prosecutor 's office , which took over the case after it attracted wide media coverage , the victim does n't remember having been beaten up and ca n't identify the attackers .
the two men remain under investigation , the prosecutor 's office said . federal prosecutor kay nehm has said he believes the attack was motivated by xenophobia . the men 's release from custody made headlines throughout the country in the midst of an impassioned public discussion about xenophobia in germany .
the alarm was sounded last week by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go , " said heye , referring to the state surrounding the capital ..
they might not make it out alive .

the two men who attacked giyasettin sayan , a regional parliamentarian for the neo-communist left party , called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack justified last week 's warnings . the premier of brandenburg , matthias platzeck , on sunday admitted that xenophobia was a problem in the state . " we have to accept that it is not a problem that can be resolved from one day to the next , " he said .
" we have gone through a phase where we minimized and denied the problem , where we said : ' my god , if we speak about this openly we will hurt our image and then nobody will come here ' . " in early january , a 12-year-old boy of ethiopian origin was attacked by a group of neo-nazi youths who forced him at gun-point to lick their boots in the eastern town of magdeburg .
they were jailed this week by a judge who said the color of the victim 's skin was " the sole reason " for the attack .
fear of tarnished image the debate about whether racism is on the rise and the damage it could do has peaked less than three weeks before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , with about one million foreign fans expected to attend the tournament .
the government has been running a campaign to promote germany as an open , friendly society in the hope that those who come will return one day . the leader of the greens , claudia roth , said there was no point in hushing the debate for fear of scaring off foreigners , as recent events spoke for themselves . " it is not talking about the far-right that threatens to harm our reputation but the very facts themselves .
these are not lone incidents , but that we have a widespread , deep-seated problem with right-wing extremist violence in our country . "

the aid will include setting up naval and air patrols . the offer came after autonomous spanish authorities in the canary islands called on madrid and the european union for help . " we can not solve problems overnight , however we are very willing and committed to assist the spanish government in our best possible ways , either with financial means -lrb- or -rrb- operationally , " an eu spokesman said . his comments came as spanish and eu officials held talks in brussels late tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of refugees are estimated to die in sea crossings about 7,500 illegal immigrants have landed in the canaries this year , with some 2,000 africans reaching the islands this month alone .
that compares with 4,751 for the whole of last year , and 8,500 in 2004 . ' a european problem ' the incredible rise in illegal immigrant numbers comes as a result of moves by morocco and spain to block easier migration routes into europe .
now , the migrants leave from the west sahara , mauritania and senegal , often packed into small fishing boats .
spain 's deputy prime minister , maria-teresa fernandez de la vega , said the whole of europe should take responsibility for the problem . “ it ’ s clear that this is not just a problem which affects spain , but one that concerns the whole of europe .
it ’ s a difficult situation , which affects millions of people trying to leave their continent .
we have to approach the migration problem from different angles : cooperation with the refugees ' countries of origin , development aid and regulating the influx to europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa fernandez de la vega initially , frontex , eu 's expert border-control agency in poland , will be sent in to advise spanish border guards .
they are also to construct a coordination point in the canary islands .

" already eight have come forward who are ready to provide rapid offshore vessels and reconnaissance planes . " pledge from brussels the aim is to locate and detain vessels as they are leaving the african coast .
spain says the eu has also proposed setting up reception centers for immigrants who arrive in the canaries .
brussels has also pledged some 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in aid to madrid to cope with the refugees . spain 's fernandez de la vega was due to hold further talks on the problem with european commission president jose manuel barroso , external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , justice commissioner franco frattini and the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : " after those meetings i think we will have a very good view on what it is the spanish government would like the european union , particularly the commission , to do , " said an eu spokesman . " we would then have a best overview of the measures requested and we could then obviously devise our own response to this , " he said . looking at africa the problem must also be addressed in africa itself .
in the long-term , the eu says it will work to improve the situation in the refugees ' own countries .
however , this will be a long and arduous process . spain and senegal agreed to work on stemming the flow of immigration on tuesday , but failed to sign a formal repatriation agreement .
the main reason many africans want to leave is due to extreme poverty .
niger ’ s foreign ministry says this is the real problem that must be tackled to stop migration . spanish policy is to deport all migrants who don ’ t meet asylum conditions .
however , those with no identification , or from countries that have no deportation accord with madrid , often simply end up moving elsewhere in europe . spain ’ s foreign minister has complained that the bureaucracy of the system means he is constantly required to sign new deportation agreements with african countries .
but human rights groups are warning against any mass deportation policy , which they claim legitimate asylum seekers could also get caught up in . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tighter eu borders forcing refugees to take bigger risks with every new influx of refugees from africa , the eu is under increased pressure .

the aid will include setting up naval and air patrols . the offer came after autonomous spanish authorities in the canary islands called on madrid and the european union for help . " we can not solve problems overnight , however we are very willing and committed to assist the spanish government in our best possible ways , either with financial means -lrb- or -rrb- operationally , " an eu spokesman said . his comments came as spanish and eu officials held talks in brussels late tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of refugees are estimated to die in sea crossings about 7,500 illegal immigrants have landed in the canaries this year , with some 2,000 africans reaching the islands this month alone .
that compares with 4,751 for the whole of last year , and 8,500 in 2004 . ' a european problem ' the incredible rise in illegal immigrant numbers comes as a result of moves by morocco and spain to block easier migration routes into europe .
now , the migrants leave from the west sahara , mauritania and senegal , often packed into small fishing boats .
spain 's deputy prime minister , maria-teresa fernandez de la vega , said the whole of europe should take responsibility for the problem . “ it ’ s clear that this is not just a problem which affects spain , but one that concerns the whole of europe .
it ’ s a difficult situation , which affects millions of people trying to leave their continent .
we have to approach the migration problem from different angles : cooperation with the refugees ' countries of origin , development aid and regulating the influx to europe . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teresa fernandez de la vega initially , frontex , eu 's expert border-control agency in poland , will be sent in to advise spanish border guards .
they are also to construct a coordination point in the canary islands .
and eu justice and interior affairs commissioner franco frattini said spain can also expect back-up from other eu states . “ in two weeks we will be able to call upon member states , " said frattini .
" already eight have come forward who are ready to provide rapid offshore vessels and reconnaissance planes . " pledge from brussels the aim is to locate and detain vessels as they are leaving the african coast .
spain says the eu has also proposed setting up reception centers for immigrants who arrive in the canaries .
brussels has also pledged some 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.6 million -rrb- in aid to madrid to cope with the refugees . spain 's fernandez de la vega was due to hold further talks on the problem with european commission president jose manuel barroso , external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner , justice commissioner franco frattini and the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana . bildunterschrift : " after those meetings i think we will have a very good view on what it is the spanish government would like the european union , particularly the commission , to do , " said an eu spokesman . " we would then have a best overview of the measures requested and we could then obviously devise our own response to this , " he said . looking at africa the problem must also be addressed in africa itself .
in the long-term , the eu says it will work to improve the situation in the refugees ' own countries .
however , this will be a long and arduous process . spain and senegal agreed to work on stemming the flow of immigration on tuesday , but failed to sign a formal repatriation agreement .
the main reason many africans want to leave is due to extreme poverty .
niger ’ s foreign ministry says this is the real problem that must be tackled to stop migration . spanish policy is to deport all migrants who don ’ t meet asylum conditions .
however , those with no identification , or from countries that have no deportation accord with madrid , often simply end up moving elsewhere in europe . spain ’ s foreign minister has complained that the bureaucracy of the system means he is constantly required to sign new deportation agreements with african countries .
but human rights groups are warning against any mass deportation policy , which they claim legitimate asylum seekers could also get caught up in . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tighter eu borders forcing refugees to take bigger risks with every new influx of refugees from africa , the eu is under increased pressure .
help in containing the problem seems to follow swiftly , but mostly in the form of funding for increased policing and border security .

schröder , who had a very close relationship to russian president vladimir putin , had called the leader a " flawless democrat . "

both polls were conducted by polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franciscan nuns observe the construction of an altar for pope benedict xvi 's holy mass outside of krakow benedict xvi is due thursday to start a four-day visit to poland .
his itinerary will take him to places that were significant in john paul ii 's life and papacy , and also to the former nazi death camp at auschwitz-birkenau , on the outskirts of the southern polish town of oswiecim . hope for better relations last week , the primate of poland , cardinal jozef glemp , said the visit by the pope would help to improve relations between poles and germans , who still have not fully healed all the wounds opened by the german invasion of poland in september 1939 , which sparked world war ii . " i think that benedict 's nationality will bring poles and germans closer together , " glemp said in an interview with warsaw daily zycie warszawy . important gesture " how can one fail to appreciate the fact that the pope , whose origins are german , is visiting - at the beginning of his pontificate - warsaw , which was destroyed during the war , and the auschwitz death camp ? " a gesture like that can not be overlooked , either in its social or its political dimension , " glemp said . the surveys , conducted by pbs dga in poland and demoskopie allensbach in germany , also asked what importance poles and germans attached to the fact that benedict 's predecessor , john paul ii , was polish in origin . eighty-two percent of poles said it was " good " that the pope was polish , while the remaining 18 percent attached no great weight to john paul ii 's nationality .
no one had a negative opinion on the matter . in the german survey , 67 percent of respondents said the fact john paul ii was polish was positive , 30 percent said it was unimportant , and three percent had a negative opinion . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope benedict confounds critics with kinder , gentler image when joseph ratzinger was elected pope , he got mixed reactions in his native germany , with many reform-oriented groups fearing the bite of the man known as " god 's rottweiler .

european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good . the united states is trying to rally its partners behind plans to build a missile shield but many in europe , where some of the network would be based , remain skeptical , defense analysts say . the system , which will consist of 10 antimissile interceptors - rockets designed to shoot down incoming missiles - is scheduled to be ready by 2011 .
it will be integrated into a broader american missile defense system that is designed to protect the us homeland - not europe , per se . iran , deep in conflict with the west over its nuclear program , announced in april that it had tested a new generation of medium-range missile featuring multiple warheads and radar-evading technology . the pentagon says that no decision has been taken yet about where on the old continent the missile defense system might be located . " we expect these consultations will continue in the coming weeks and months with countries that have expressed an interest , " pentagon spokesman bryan whitman told reporters in washington on monday . a difference in perception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a necessity , some as a space wars fantasy some experts suggest the plans have run up against different visions of what constitutes a threat on either side of the atlantic .

european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good . the united states is trying to rally its partners behind plans to build a missile shield but many in europe , where some of the network would be based , remain skeptical , defense analysts say . the system , which will consist of 10 antimissile interceptors - rockets designed to shoot down incoming missiles - is scheduled to be ready by 2011 .
it will be integrated into a broader american missile defense system that is designed to protect the us homeland - not europe , per se . iran , deep in conflict with the west over its nuclear program , announced in april that it had tested a new generation of medium-range missile featuring multiple warheads and radar-evading technology . the pentagon says that no decision has been taken yet about where on the old continent the missile defense system might be located .

the current system is no longer aimed at russia , rather its aimed at so-called " rogue states " - and is specifically designed to counter a potential nuclear strike from iran . at nato headquarters , officials refused to publicly comment on the us plans .

"
conservative values have been making a comeback among germany 's youth in recent years .
but parents punished with obstreperous offspring can not always relay on the help of authorities , as one mother had to find out . hildesheim in northern germany is n't exactly known as hedonist central .
the city of about 100,000 people takes pride in its architectural gems , such as " one of the world 's prettiest " market squares and two religious buildings that have been included in the unesco 's list of world cultural heritage sites : st. michaelis ' church and the city 's cathedral , where hildesheimers flock each year to admire the blossoming rose tree , which allegedly was planted more than 1,000 years ago . the city has come up with cute little cartoons to gently remind people that they 'll have to pay 50 euros -lrb- $ 64 -rrb- for dropping a chewing gum on the street or that not cleaning up after their dogs will set them back double that amount .
germany 's snoring museum is actually not located in hildesheim proper , but in a little town nearby . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : appearances deceive : despite the serenity of st. michaelis , not all is well in hildesheim but all this can not deter from the fact that not all is well in hildesheim as far as morals are concerned : some of the city 's young ladies appear to engage in absolutely inappropriate behavior when it comes to their relationships with men . one virtuous hildesheimer mother now recently decided to put a stop to her daughter 's indecent philandering .
she called the city 's youth services department and complained to officials about her child 's mä n n ergeschichte n , which literally translates to " men tales . " given the nature of the complaint , asking about the daughter 's age probably seemed like a reasonable thing to do . " she 's 68 , " the 92-year-old mother told youth service officials , who responded that the daughter was about half a century too old to fall under their jurisdiction .
instead , they dispatched a team of police officers to the mother 's home .
law enforcement officials apparently managed to end the fight between the couple . reports that the daughter 's been grounded for the next four weeks could not be confirmed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's graying gangsters criminality among german senior citizens is on the rise .

they are now facing fines of up to 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 19,000 -rrb- or prison sentences of up to three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edonkey is not the only piece of software which enables peer-to-peer data sharing " this was the largest action against illegal file-sharing offers on the internet that has ever been carried out in germany , " said public prosecutor jürgen krautkremer . illegal file sharing is usually thought of as the favorite pastime of the younger generation of internet users , but the state-wide , coordinated swoop by the german police reveals a different story . " contrary to popular belief , -lrb- illegal file sharing -rrb- is by no means about young people only , " krautkremer said . people of all ages were found to be engaged in illegal , copyright-violating activities . an internet hunt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the music industry feels crippled by internet piracy a couple of months ago , according to krautkremer , investigators started monitoring a server located in the german city of hürth , southwest of cologne .
the server , whose owners are not being prosecuted , was itself connected to the edonkey peer-to-peer network for data exchange . using a special piece of software , developed by the international federation of phonographic industry , the investigators profiled and analyzed some 800,000 records , including a 14-gigabyte log file which contained around 40,000 internet addresses . individual users were identified with the help of internet providers , and search warrants were issued for those users who could be proved to have shared more than 500 files or , approximately , 25 to 30 cds during the period under observation . positive reactions the music industry greeted the outcome of the police action in germany . " no one should be surprised that we are stepping up our campaign in this way , " said john kennedy , chairman and chief executive of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- . " internet piracy has hurt the whole music community in germany , with legitimate sales falling by a third in just five years , " he said . according to ifpi , some 400 million copyright infringing music files were downloaded illegally last year in germany . " when music gets stolen , there is less money left to invest in new musicians , " kennedy said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu wants digital library by 2010 at least six million books , documents and " other cultural works " are to be put online and housed in the european digital library by 2010 , the european commission said thursday .

at the same time , a spate of racist attacks has germany fearing for its hard-won reputation for tolerance . the men were released after a month in police custody on tuesday because they were no longer under " strong suspicion " of beating the ethiopian-born engineer into a coma .
two men had attacked ermyas m. in april in potsdam , outside berlin , and called him a " dirty nigger . "
according to the federal prosecutor 's office , which took over the case after it attracted wide media coverage , the victim does n't remember having been beaten up and ca n't identify the attackers .
the two men remain under investigation , the prosecutor 's office said . federal prosecutor kay nehm has said he believes the attack was motivated by xenophobia . the men 's release from custody made headlines throughout the country in the midst of an impassioned public discussion about xenophobia in germany .
the alarm was sounded last week by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go , " said heye , referring to the state surrounding the capital ..
they might not make it out alive . " heye , now a spokesman for an anti-racism lobby , was not alone in warning of xenophobic pockets in the former communist east , where the country 's neo-nazi party has found a following among unemployed youths . the africa council , a group for expatriates , plans to publish a " no-go-area " brochure listing clubs , bars and restaurants in and around berlin which should give black soccer fans a wide berth . politician attacked but politicians and football authorities said heye 's statement scored an own goal for a country , which has painstakingly confronted its nazi past to earn a reputation for political correctness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sayan was attacked over the weekend over the weekend , the debate took another turn when a german politician of turkish origin was beaten and his head slashed with a broken bottle in lichtenberg , a working class part of berlin known as a neo-nazi stronghold .
the two men who attacked giyasettin sayan , a regional parliamentarian for the neo-communist left party , called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack justified last week 's warnings . the premier of brandenburg , matthias platzeck , on sunday admitted that xenophobia was a problem in the state . " we have to accept that it is not a problem that can be resolved from one day to the next , " he said .
" we have gone through a phase where we minimized and denied the problem , where we said : ' my god , if we speak about this openly we will hurt our image and then nobody will come here ' . " in early january , a 12-year-old boy of ethiopian origin was attacked by a group of neo-nazi youths who forced him at gun-point to lick their boots in the eastern town of magdeburg .
they were jailed this week by a judge who said the color of the victim 's skin was " the sole reason " for the attack .
fear of tarnished image the debate about whether racism is on the rise and the damage it could do has peaked less than three weeks before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , with about one million foreign fans expected to attend the tournament .
the government has been running a campaign to promote germany as an open , friendly society in the hope that those who come will return one day . the leader of the greens , claudia roth , said there was no point in hushing the debate for fear of scaring off foreigners , as recent events spoke for themselves . " it is not talking about the far-right that threatens to harm our reputation but the very facts themselves .
these are not lone incidents , but that we have a widespread , deep-seated problem with right-wing extremist violence in our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi attacks have increased in germany over the weekend , bild newspaper leaked an extract of a government report stating that the number of neo-nazis in germany had grown from 3,800 in 2004 to 4,200 last year .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble released statistics on monday saying that the number of violent crimes attributed to the far-right had risen by 23 percent in 2005 . wilhelm heitmeyer , a sociologist at the university of bielefeld , blamed the poor state of the economy and the frustration it created for animosity towards foreigners . " it is a german problem , though there is a stronger tendency in the east , " heitmeyer told the news agency afp .

at the same time , a spate of racist attacks has germany fearing for its hard-won reputation for tolerance . the men were released after a month in police custody on tuesday because they were no longer under " strong suspicion " of beating the ethiopian-born engineer into a coma .
two men had attacked ermyas m. in april in potsdam , outside berlin , and called him a " dirty nigger . "
according to the federal prosecutor 's office , which took over the case after it attracted wide media coverage , the victim does n't remember having been beaten up and ca n't identify the attackers .
the two men remain under investigation , the prosecutor 's office said . federal prosecutor kay nehm has said he believes the attack was motivated by xenophobia . the men 's release from custody made headlines throughout the country in the midst of an impassioned public discussion about xenophobia in germany .
the alarm was sounded last week by a former government spokesman , uwe-karsten heye , who said non-whites were not safe in some areas of former east germany near berlin . " there are small and mid-sized towns in brandenburg and elsewhere where i would advise anyone with a different skin color not to go , " said heye , referring to the state surrounding the capital ..
they might not make it out alive . " heye , now a spokesman for an anti-racism lobby , was not alone in warning of xenophobic pockets in the former communist east , where the country 's neo-nazi party has found a following among unemployed youths . the africa council , a group for expatriates , plans to publish a " no-go-area " brochure listing clubs , bars and restaurants in and around berlin which should give black soccer fans a wide berth . politician attacked but politicians and football authorities said heye 's statement scored an own goal for a country , which has painstakingly confronted its nazi past to earn a reputation for political correctness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sayan was attacked over the weekend over the weekend , the debate took another turn when a german politician of turkish origin was beaten and his head slashed with a broken bottle in lichtenberg , a working class part of berlin known as a neo-nazi stronghold .
the two men who attacked giyasettin sayan , a regional parliamentarian for the neo-communist left party , called him a " dirty foreigner , " police said . sayan 's party chief in the berlin assembly , stefan liebich , said the attack justified last week 's warnings . the premier of brandenburg , matthias platzeck , on sunday admitted that xenophobia was a problem in the state . " we have to accept that it is not a problem that can be resolved from one day to the next , " he said .
" we have gone through a phase where we minimized and denied the problem , where we said : ' my god , if we speak about this openly we will hurt our image and then nobody will come here ' . " in early january , a 12-year-old boy of ethiopian origin was attacked by a group of neo-nazi youths who forced him at gun-point to lick their boots in the eastern town of magdeburg .
they were jailed this week by a judge who said the color of the victim 's skin was " the sole reason " for the attack .
fear of tarnished image the debate about whether racism is on the rise and the damage it could do has peaked less than three weeks before the world cup kicks off in munich on june 9 , with about one million foreign fans expected to attend the tournament .
the government has been running a campaign to promote germany as an open , friendly society in the hope that those who come will return one day . the leader of the greens , claudia roth , said there was no point in hushing the debate for fear of scaring off foreigners , as recent events spoke for themselves . " it is not talking about the far-right that threatens to harm our reputation but the very facts themselves .
these are not lone incidents , but that we have a widespread , deep-seated problem with right-wing extremist violence in our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazi attacks have increased in germany over the weekend , bild newspaper leaked an extract of a government report stating that the number of neo-nazis in germany had grown from 3,800 in 2004 to 4,200 last year .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble released statistics on monday saying that the number of violent crimes attributed to the far-right had risen by 23 percent in 2005 . wilhelm heitmeyer , a sociologist at the university of bielefeld , blamed the poor state of the economy and the frustration it created for animosity towards foreigners . " it is a german problem , though there is a stronger tendency in the east , " heitmeyer told the news agency afp .

the aid will include setting up naval and air patrols . the offer came after autonomous spanish authorities in the canary islands called on madrid and the european union for help . " we can not solve problems overnight , however we are very willing and committed to assist the spanish government in our best possible ways , either with financial means -lrb- or -rrb- operationally , " an eu spokesman said . his comments came as spanish and eu officials held talks in brussels late tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of refugees are estimated to die in sea crossings about 7,500 illegal immigrants have landed in the canaries this year , with some 2,000 africans reaching the islands this month alone .
that compares with 4,751 for the whole of last year , and 8,500 in 2004 . ' a european problem ' the incredible rise in illegal immigrant numbers comes as a result of moves by morocco and spain to block easier migration routes into europe .
now , the migrants leave from the west sahara , mauritania and senegal , often packed into small fishing boats .
spain 's deputy prime minister , maria-teresa fernandez de la vega , said the whole of europe should take responsibility for the problem . “ it ’ s clear that this is not just a problem which affects spain , but one that concerns the whole of europe .
it ’ s a difficult situation , which affects millions of people trying to leave their continent .

in the long-term , the eu says it will work to improve the situation in the refugees ' own countries .
however , this will be a long and arduous process . spain and senegal agreed to work on stemming the flow of immigration on tuesday , but failed to sign a formal repatriation agreement .
the main reason many africans want to leave is due to extreme poverty .
niger ’ s foreign ministry says this is the real problem that must be tackled to stop migration . spanish policy is to deport all migrants who don ’ t meet asylum conditions .

and just ahead of the talks , a report emerged of differences of opinion within the us administration over strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice , speaking at a meeting on iran 's nuclear policies , in march us secretary of state condoleezza rice had " gone out on a limb " to back the european package of trade and technology incentives but had met resistance from vice-president dick cheney , the financial times newspaper reported . cheney is said to be against the idea of " rewarding bad behavior " after iran allegedly breached its nuclear safeguards commitments , according to the newspaper report based on comments from diplomats and analysts . it said that the divisions were complicating the eu proposal that world powers support iran 's building of several light water reactors , set up a nuclear fuel bank , and have the united states drop restrictions on iran 's buying of us commercial airplanes , if tehran takes steps to guarantee it will not make nuclear weapons . but if tehran does not do this , sanctions should follow , including an arms embargo , according to the proposal . russia supports eu plan the newspaper said some european diplomats think the us will back their proposals if russia supports a tough un resolution that would require iran to suspend uranium enrichment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministesr lavrov -lrb- left -rrb- met german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in april to discuss the iran issue during a tour of arab gulf countries kuwait and qatar on tuesday , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said moscow supports the eu proposal and urged tehran to cooperate . asked if russia would back military action against iran if the proposed negotiations collapsed , lavrov declined to answer but insisted that moscow does not support the use of force " in principle . " the united states , britain , france , china and russia are the five permanent members of the un security council , which has the power to endorse sanctions or us military strikes , an option which is nonetheless broadly opposed . iran 's hardline government has already rejected the european offer and insisted its uranium enrichment program is not up for negotiation .
in tehran earlier , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad boasted that the islamic republic had " mastered the entire nuclear fuel cycle " and that it would give an " historic slap " to any attacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary-general annan urged iran to hear out the latest proposal u.n. secretary-general kofi annan , speaking in vietnam , said he had appealed to iran to reassure the world that its nuclear intentions are peaceful and asked it " not to reject anything out of hand " which might emerge from the talks in london . exercise in futility ? but one eu diplomat said it was hard to see what the meeting , which started around midday , could achieve .
" it 's really just an academic exercise , since the iranians have made it clear that they wo n't accept any offer , " he told reuters news service . the united states has refused to rule out military action . iran says it wants to use the fuel cycle only to make civilian reactor fuel , and argues such work for peaceful purposes is a " right " enshrined by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . but the same technology can be extended to make atomic weapons , and the us in particular claims iran is merely exploiting a loophole in the npt . citing us officials , iranian analysts and foreign diplomats , the washington post newspaper reported wednesday that iran had requested through intermediaries direct talks with washington over its nuclear program . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-3 preparing new incentives for iran while us talks tough the un security council 's five permanent members plus germany are to meet in london to consider new incentives being prepared by european negotiators for iran to renounce its disputed nuclear program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.05.2006 europe skeptical about us missile shield plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not entirely clear if the us missile defense system would actually benefit europe as tensions grow over iran 's nuclear program , the us is allegedly moving to locate a missile defense system in europe .
european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good . the united states is trying to rally its partners behind plans to build a missile shield but many in europe , where some of the network would be based , remain skeptical , defense analysts say . the system , which will consist of 10 antimissile interceptors - rockets designed to shoot down incoming missiles - is scheduled to be ready by 2011 .
it will be integrated into a broader american missile defense system that is designed to protect the us homeland - not europe , per se . iran , deep in conflict with the west over its nuclear program , announced in april that it had tested a new generation of medium-range missile featuring multiple warheads and radar-evading technology . the pentagon says that no decision has been taken yet about where on the old continent the missile defense system might be located . " we expect these consultations will continue in the coming weeks and months with countries that have expressed an interest , " pentagon spokesman bryan whitman told reporters in washington on monday . a difference in perception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a necessity , some as a space wars fantasy some experts suggest the plans have run up against different visions of what constitutes a threat on either side of the atlantic . " there is a difference in perception , " said andrew brookes of the london-based international institute for strategic studies . " america is looking at protection from strategic missile attacks from places like china , north korea and iran .
europe does n't believe that 's a threat . " " europeans , inherently , do n't buy into this fantasy , " brookes said . the plans are the latest chapter in the development of an anti-missile program , initially attempted at great cost under us president ronald reagan during the cold war .
the current system is no longer aimed at russia , rather its aimed at so-called " rogue states " - and is specifically designed to counter a potential nuclear strike from iran . at nato headquarters , officials refused to publicly comment on the us plans . " the us took a political decision to go ahead with the deployment of a missile defense system years ago whereas europe has n't had that discussion , " one nato source said , adding that washington is " forging ahead . " possible scenarios bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a powerful radar on its way to a us base in alaska the debate may not yet have taken place , but the 26 members of nato have in hand a 10,000-page feasibility study setting out the case for a missile shield and the possible scenarios in which one might be useful . ordered by nato leaders in prague in 2002 , the text has not been discussed at political level yet , but the united states is pushing its allies to debate the subject at the next alliance summit in riga , latvia in november . " there is a growing threat of long-range missile attack on nato territory and it is timely to examine ways and means of addressing that threat , " said marshall billingslea , head of nato 's conference of national armaments directors , announcing that the report had been completed . europe remains cautious europe is , nevertheless , unlikely to act too hastily . " on the european side , there is an almost categorical refusal to take decisions on the run , " said rik coolsaet of the royal institute of international relations in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us sees iran as a more immediate threat " politically , europeans understand that there is a potential danger from the iranians , but it is not a danger they see likely in the short term .
the sense of urgency is far less present in europe than in the united states , " coolsaet said . another obstacle to accepting the us plan is that it remains to be seen whether such a missile shield can actually work . former head of the pentagon 's office of operational test and evaluation says the interceptors have n't " had a successful intercept test for 4 years . "
but the pentagon has brushed this aside saying the " technical problems " are not " show stoppers . " " we are being asked - us , the europeans - to make a huge investment to buy a program which , even in the united states , is not believed to be ready , " coolsaet said . no way some observers would go as far as saying that the basic premise of the anti-missile program is essentially flawed . " i do n't see any evidence that the iranians are producing a weapon that can reach new york , " brookes said .
" i do n't see any evidence that if they had such a weapon , they would even in their wildest dreams contemplate using it given the massive preponderance of retaliatory capability the united states has . " according to brookes , it is more important to focus on current rather than potential threats . " we have to focus on the threat that really matters , and what matters at present is defending troops that might be deployed rather than defending berlin against a perception of a threat , " he said . " german politicians , french politicians and british politicians do not regard pyongyang as about to launch anything in the foreseeable future at a european capital , " brookes said .
" they just do n't .

european observers , however , tend to question its benefits and think it could do more harm than good . the united states is trying to rally its partners behind plans to build a missile shield but many in europe , where some of the network would be based , remain skeptical , defense analysts say . the system , which will consist of 10 antimissile interceptors - rockets designed to shoot down incoming missiles - is scheduled to be ready by 2011 .
it will be integrated into a broader american missile defense system that is designed to protect the us homeland - not europe , per se . iran , deep in conflict with the west over its nuclear program , announced in april that it had tested a new generation of medium-range missile featuring multiple warheads and radar-evading technology . the pentagon says that no decision has been taken yet about where on the old continent the missile defense system might be located . " we expect these consultations will continue in the coming weeks and months with countries that have expressed an interest , " pentagon spokesman bryan whitman told reporters in washington on monday . a difference in perception bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see it as a necessity , some as a space wars fantasy some experts suggest the plans have run up against different visions of what constitutes a threat on either side of the atlantic .

" america is looking at protection from strategic missile attacks from places like china , north korea and iran .
europe does n't believe that 's a threat . " " europeans , inherently , do n't buy into this fantasy , " brookes said . the plans are the latest chapter in the development of an anti-missile program , initially attempted at great cost under us president ronald reagan during the cold war .
the current system is no longer aimed at russia , rather its aimed at so-called " rogue states " - and is specifically designed to counter a potential nuclear strike from iran . at nato headquarters , officials refused to publicly comment on the us plans .

" there is a growing threat of long-range missile attack on nato territory and it is timely to examine ways and means of addressing that threat , " said marshall billingslea , head of nato 's conference of national armaments directors , announcing that the report had been completed . europe remains cautious europe is , nevertheless , unlikely to act too hastily .

demand was strong and the sale was oversubscribed as investors tried to tap into strong growth and an expected surge in demand for financial services .
the company priced its shares at 2.95 hong kong dollars -lrb- $ 0.38 -rrb- each , 5 cents below the top of its pricing range .
investors , undeterred by a tumble across global markets , said it boded well for other sales later this year .

more to come investors placed orders worth $ 152bn for bank of china shares , with the retail side at least 70 times over-subscribed , reports said .
bank of china will now look to list its shares in mainland china later this year , the reuters news agency quoted an unidentified source as saying .
analysts said that despite the strong demand , bank of china 's shares were unlikely to surge when they start trading because of the pressure that world markets have been under .
" i do n't expect the bank to post sharp gains in the near term unless the market rebounds sharply , " said kingston lin of prudential bache securities .
china 's banking market is due to be opened up to greater competition from december and many of the state-owned banks are looking to foreign investors to help them prepare .
last year , a consortium of international banks led by royal bank of scotland spent $ 3bn on a 10 % stake in bank of china .

bbc news -pipe- south asia -pipe- india to implement caste quotas bbc news / south asia graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- wednesday , 24 may 2006 , 07:29 gmt 08:29 uk india to implement caste quotas the indian government has decided to implement a controversial affirmative action plan despite ongoing protests .
under the plan , half of state-funded professional college places would go to lower caste students .
after a meeting which ended late on tuesday night , the congress-led indian government announced that a bill would be introduced in parliament .
the plan will come into effect in 2007 .
those opposed to it say it will lead to a drop in college standards .
at present , 22.5 % of college places are " reserved " for dalits , or untouchables , who are at the bottom of india 's caste hierarchy , and tribal students .
under the new plan , 27 % of places will also be set aside for lower caste hindus known as other backward castes -lrb- obcs -rrb- and other socially disadvantaged groups .
" the percentage of reservation for obcs will be fixed at 27 % , " defence pranab mukherjee told reporters after a three-hour meeting between the government and its allies .
" legislation for this purpose will be brought in parliament in the monsoon session . "
strike however , the move has drawn fire from medical students as well as business leaders and teachers who say it will lead to a drop in standards .
doctors and medical staff at state-run hospitals have been on strike for nearly two weeks , affecting medical services in the capital delhi and other indian cities .

it will offer policyholders a welcome but not life-changing windfall of shares .
each member who took out a with-profits policy before 31 march 2004 , will receive a fixed allocation of 185 shares , with additional shares being issued depending upon the length of time they have held the policy and its value .
with a forecast flotation price of between 240p and 290p per share , the average value of the windfall is expected to be about £ 1,700 .
with the majority of policyholders not being at the high end of the investment scale , it is likely that half will receive between £ 500 and £ 1,000 .
those who invested six-figure sums in standard life with-profits products five or ten years ago can expect to receive shares worth about £ 3,000 if a mid-range flotation price is realised .
small beer even at the top end this is fairly small beer - well below the windfalls of £ 5,000 to £ 6,000 which were suggested when members rejected demutualisation six years ago .
if the cash would help towards one of life 's essentials , such as household maintenance , university fees , even a holiday , take the money and enjoy q & a : standard life demutualisation since then , of course , standard life has endured a turbulent existence during which its loyalty to downward-spiralling stock market investments cost the company - and its members - dearly .
this has manifested itself in dramatically-reduced policy maturity forecasts .
not surprisingly , many members may see demutualisation as a chance to get something back to offset the shortfalls they are going to suffer in their with-profits pension or endowment policies - not that the offer of shares should be seen in any way as compensation for under-performing policies .
it is purely a carrot to members to get them to agree to standard life 's demutualisation , which will see in excess of £ 1bn of additional funds brought into the company through the issue of shares to external investors .
the members , who currently own 100 % of the company , will effectively see their share and influence diminish as new , institutional stakeholders buy in .
in the recent past members have seen that as too high a price to pay and there is likely to be a significant minority who continue to oppose demutualisation because of the dilution of ownership it will bring .
the windfalls on offer certainly offer fairly poor compensation for allowing standard life to sell some of the family silver .
sell or hold ?
whether to sell quickly or to hold on to shares should be a personal choice based upon your most urgent needs .
the windfall is being offered in compensation for a likely reduction in the level of profit from the total standard life business - currently 100 per cent - which goes towards with-profits policies if the cash would help towards one of life 's essentials , such as household maintenance , university fees , even a holiday , take the money and enjoy .
just be wary of triggering capital gains tax if you 've already made or are planning killings worth in total more than £ 8,800 on your investments in the financial year 2006-7 .
more considered decisions need to be taken if the windfall is to be held as an investment .
standard life has offered members the chance to buy additional shares at a price discounted from the flotation price if they hold on to their shares - and those retaining shares for a year will get one free share per 20 held .
the merit of such an offer depends upon the fairly unpredictable short to medium-term performance of the company on the stock market , although there is no reason to doubt that standard life will keep pace with the steady growth of the ftse since its low of march 2003 .
financial consultants , however , generally advise clients not to have too many of their investment portfolio eggs in one basket , and there might be merit in spreading the investment across a wider range of holdings in order to offset the impact of a potentially volatile market .

the windfall is being offered in compensation for a likely reduction in the level of profit from the total standard life business - currently 100 % - which goes towards with-profits policies .

it will offer policyholders a welcome but not life-changing windfall of shares .
each member who took out a with-profits policy before 31 march 2004 , will receive a fixed allocation of 185 shares , with additional shares being issued depending upon the length of time they have held the policy and its value .
with a forecast flotation price of between 240p and 290p per share , the average value of the windfall is expected to be about £ 1,700 .
with the majority of policyholders not being at the high end of the investment scale , it is likely that half will receive between £ 500 and £ 1,000 .
those who invested six-figure sums in standard life with-profits products five or ten years ago can expect to receive shares worth about £ 3,000 if a mid-range flotation price is realised .
small beer even at the top end this is fairly small beer - well below the windfalls of £ 5,000 to £ 6,000 which were suggested when members rejected demutualisation six years ago .
if the cash would help towards one of life 's essentials , such as household maintenance , university fees , even a holiday , take the money and enjoy q & a : standard life demutualisation since then , of course , standard life has endured a turbulent existence during which its loyalty to downward-spiralling stock market investments cost the company - and its members - dearly .
this has manifested itself in dramatically-reduced policy maturity forecasts .
not surprisingly , many members may see demutualisation as a chance to get something back to offset the shortfalls they are going to suffer in their with-profits pension or endowment policies - not that the offer of shares should be seen in any way as compensation for under-performing policies .
it is purely a carrot to members to get them to agree to standard life 's demutualisation , which will see in excess of £ 1bn of additional funds brought into the company through the issue of shares to external investors .
the members , who currently own 100 % of the company , will effectively see their share and influence diminish as new , institutional stakeholders buy in .
in the recent past members have seen that as too high a price to pay and there is likely to be a significant minority who continue to oppose demutualisation because of the dilution of ownership it will bring .
the windfalls on offer certainly offer fairly poor compensation for allowing standard life to sell some of the family silver .
sell or hold ?
whether to sell quickly or to hold on to shares should be a personal choice based upon your most urgent needs .
the windfall is being offered in compensation for a likely reduction in the level of profit from the total standard life business - currently 100 per cent - which goes towards with-profits policies if the cash would help towards one of life 's essentials , such as household maintenance , university fees , even a holiday , take the money and enjoy .
just be wary of triggering capital gains tax if you 've already made or are planning killings worth in total more than £ 8,800 on your investments in the financial year 2006-7 .
more considered decisions need to be taken if the windfall is to be held as an investment .
standard life has offered members the chance to buy additional shares at a price discounted from the flotation price if they hold on to their shares - and those retaining shares for a year will get one free share per 20 held .
the merit of such an offer depends upon the fairly unpredictable short to medium-term performance of the company on the stock market , although there is no reason to doubt that standard life will keep pace with the steady growth of the ftse since its low of march 2003 .
financial consultants , however , generally advise clients not to have too many of their investment portfolio eggs in one basket , and there might be merit in spreading the investment across a wider range of holdings in order to offset the impact of a potentially volatile market .
what about my policy ?
whether to hold on to your with-profits policies after demutualisation requires even more careful thought .
the windfall is being offered in compensation for a likely reduction in the level of profit from the total standard life business - currently 100 % - which goes towards with-profits policies .
much will depend in this instance on the penalties , called ' market value adjusters ' , that might be imposed on the surrender of policies , so beware .
those considering transfers of with-profits policies really should consult a professional adviser to ensure the long-term stability of their savings and future payments before signing on the dotted line .

since the dawn of time we have sought short-cuts to happiness .
early man got high on psychotropic drugs .
alcohol has been around since the stone age .
the designer drugs of today promise ecstasy in a pill .
now neuroscientists are beginning to manipulate happiness in the brain .
in a series of experiments in the 1950s and 1960s psychologists pinpointed the pleasure zones in the brains of rats and eventually in human patients .
in 1954 peter milner and james olds performed a radical experiment on rats .
they implanted electrodes into rats ' brains , and found that when they gave electrical brain stimulation the rats seemed to experience pleasure and almost ecstasy at times .
the rats could press a lever which would deliver a small current deep into its brain .
it was found that they would perform complex and difficult tasks for another dose of stimulation , and would even press the lever up to 2,000 times an hour to the exclusion of eating or drinking .
olds and milner concluded that they had discovered the area of the brain responsible for reward .
in the 1960s , psychiatrist robert heath of tulane university in new orleans chose to use this same deep brain stimulation on humans .
he performed a series of experiments where he put electrodes deep into his patients ' brains .
bob heath hoped to cure depression , pain , and addiction .
but controversially he also experimented on gay men .
when a mild shock was administered to patients they felt good .
when they were handed the controls they chose to press repeatedly - sometimes over a thousand times .
but the pleasure stopped when the current was stopped and heath eventually abandoned his work .
mainstream medicine in the last few years interest in deep brain stimulation has been taken up by mainstream medicine to help patients with parkinson 's disease and also to tackle acute pain .
we met robert matthews who had had a leg amputated after an accident .
robert still suffers excruciating pain from the leg that no longer exists .
" my lowest took me so low .
i could n't even think about myself or my family or anything .
that 's how far i went .
so happiness had gone . "
find out how happy you are an operation by professor tipu aziz , consultant neurosurgeon at the oxford functional neurosurgery group , meant that the pain could be massively reduced and life for robert became bearable .
professor aziz has implanted an electrode in his brain which can in a sense make him happier .
the electrode is controlled by a switch which is in his chest .
richard is now free to control the voltage delivered to his brain and thereby reduce the pain he suffers .
" i used to worry about the fact of having something in my head but now i do n't look at it like that .
" i mean , it works to a percentage , which gives us a better way of life than what we had before . "
future happiness so could this be an idea for the future ?
morten kringelbach , a neuroscientist from oxford university , thinks it is still a long way off .
" the prospects of actually putting an electrode in and permanently changing people 's happiness , and that is the state of contentment over time , i think the only way that one can do that is by changing the circumstances that people are in . "
dr kringelbach says it is possible to manufacture pleasure .
but the priority is to use the science to alleviate pain and depression .
but robert matthews was in no doubt that if he was offered not just the chance to get rid of his pain but actually to make himself feel positively happy he would turn his switch up to the happy level .
" oh definitely .
most definitely all the way .
take it all the way , yes .
that would be a happy day , would n't it ? "
but films and literature have seen the idea of artificial happiness as sinister .
in the 1930s novelist aldous huxley wrote about it in his book " brave new world " .
the idea of synthetic emotion is also explored in the film the matrix .
happiness poll most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need adobe reader in our opinion poll we asked whether people would take pills that made them happy if there were no side-effects .
three out of four people said " no thanks " .
leading psychologist professor ed diener argues against artificial routes to happiness .
" we do not want to create a society that 's happy because of drugs .
" society that 's locked into happiness , we still want people with functioning emotion systems , systems that react when bad things are happening , and react when good things are happening . "
and it is a thought echoed by professor paul salovskis , clinical psychologist at king 's college london .
" it seems to me that drugs as a solution to unhappiness are rather similar to kind of , you know , say plastic surgery to enhance your beauty or whatever .
" the quick fix is potentially on the horizon but i think it will keep receding as it already has .
" we were promised years ago that we would have the pharmacological solution to all of emotional problems - it has n't happened . "
mark easton presents the happiness formula on bbc two on wednesdays at 1900 bst .

scientists writing in the journal biology letters found that non-native north american bullfrog populations routinely carry the chytrid fungus .
the deadly fungus has been implicated in many amphibian extinctions .
the scientists suggest the bullfrog may act as a vector because it can carry the fungus without developing disease .
frog-legs the north american bullfrog -lrb- rana catesbeiana -rrb- is the largest of the north american frogs , growing to 20cm -lrb- 8in -rrb- in length and 0.5kg -lrb- 1lb -rrb- in weight .
the bullfrog was initially introduced to countries around the world to be farmed for frog-legs , and was later imported as a pet or to decorate garden ponds .
but it has since proven a scourge to many native frog species , either by competing with or even preying on them .
what are amphibians ?
group includes frogs , toads , salamanders and caecilians first true amphibians evolved about 250m years ago adapted to many different aquatic and terrestrial habitats present today on every continent except antarctica undergo metamorphosis , from larvae to adults but this latest study also implicates the frog with the spread of a fungus which causes disease and death in many species of amphibians .
an international team of researchers analysed tissue samples from populations of bullfrogs introduced from their native north american regions into brazil , uruguay , uk , france , italy and japan , as well other regions of canada and the us .
they discovered that the frogs in every country apart from japan carried the chytrid fungus -lrb- batrachochytrium dendrobatidis -rrb- .
" we have shown that introduced bullfrogs consistently carry the fungus in the wild , " explained dr trent garner , lead author of the paper and a wildlife epidemiologist from the zoological society of london .
previous research , he said , has revealed that although bullfrogs can be infected with the fungus , they do not go on to develop disease - unlike many other species of amphibians .
" we can not say for certain that this means they have carried the chytrid fungus all around the planet .

group includes frogs , toads , salamanders and caecilians first true amphibians evolved about 250m years ago adapted to many different aquatic and terrestrial habitats present today on every continent except antarctica undergo metamorphosis , from larvae to adults but this latest study also implicates the frog with the spread of a fungus which causes disease and death in many species of amphibians .
an international team of researchers analysed tissue samples from populations of bullfrogs introduced from their native north american regions into brazil , uruguay , uk , france , italy and japan , as well other regions of canada and the us .
they discovered that the frogs in every country apart from japan carried the chytrid fungus -lrb- batrachochytrium dendrobatidis -rrb- .
" we have shown that introduced bullfrogs consistently carry the fungus in the wild , " explained dr trent garner , lead author of the paper and a wildlife epidemiologist from the zoological society of london .
previous research , he said , has revealed that although bullfrogs can be infected with the fungus , they do not go on to develop disease - unlike many other species of amphibians .

richard smith is being honoured for his work to save the arnos vale burial ground from developers .
" i am very much looking forward to meeting the queen , " he said .
" after so many years ' hard work , this is going to be a very proud moment for me . "
the cemetery , which featured in the bbc 's restoration series , is home to a host of listed monuments .
" great honour " in december last year it was awarded a £ 4.8m grant from the heritage lottery fund to help secure its future , but local campaigners are still working to raise the £ 500,000 they need to access the lottery cash .
mr smith , who will attend the ceremony with his wife joyce , added : " this is a great honour , not just for me but for all the people who have campaigned on behalf of arnos vale . "
the 45-acre cemetery was privately owned for many years , and was left neglected and in disrepair .
its owners sparked controversy five years ago when they tried to sell the land for redevelopment , but after a a campaign by local residents it was bought by the city council under a compulsory purchase order .
