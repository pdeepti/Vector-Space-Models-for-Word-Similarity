it will work alongside the european human rights body , the council of europe . the committee will submit its first report within four months after it begins work , probably next week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2006 germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany . the iranian government announced last weekend that it is planning a conference on the holocaust and intends to invite academics such as german neo-nazi horst mahler , the israeli journalist and christian convert israel shamir and the historian david irving - all of whom are holocaust deniers - as guest speakers . while there was some debate among western officials immediately after the announcement was made as to whether the conference would actually take place or that it was intended to provoke , politicians , especially in germany , were up in arms at the idea of such a conference . " this is international anti-semitism at work , " said gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in an interview with german magazine der spiegel .
his parliamentary colleague , left party member norman paech , added that the conference was part of an on-going " strategy of provocation " being employed by the iranian government . werner hoyer from the free-market liberal free democratic party told der spiegel that the idea of the conference was " untenable " and that such a meeting of holocaust skeptics at a time of heightened tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions was a " dangerous spark in the powder keg . " ahmadi n ejad spreadi n g a n ti-semitic doctri n e , claims gree n chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer warned a conference would further isolate iran .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer said that the planned conference was further evidence that president mahmoud ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran .
president ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " and has questioned the right of israel to exist . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . "
everybody which gets involved in anti-semitism or racism soils its own culture and nation , he added .
" this also applies to iran . " weisskirchen meanwhile cautioned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously .
he added that ahmadinejad was trying to validate his stance on denial by inviting well-known authorities on the subject . " ahmadinejad apparently now tries to give a quasi-scientific meaning to his rhetoric , " weisskirchen said . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .
holocaust denial is a criminal offence in germany . irvi n g a n d others would be free to speak i n ira n with impu n ity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if freed from austria , irving would be able to speak in iran without restriction .
british historian david irving is currently awaiting trial in austria on charges of holocaust denial and faces a possible sentence of between one to 10 years in prison if found guilty . irving , whose trial begins on feb .
20 , was arrested in the southern province of styria in november under a warrant issued in 1989 .
irving held two speeches in austria that year , during which he allegedly claimed there had been no gas chambers at auschwitz . however , gerry gable , the former editor of anti-fascist magazine searchlight and an authority on irving told dw-world that if irving escapes prosecution in austria , he and his fellow speakers will be free to travel to the middle east to speak with impunity . " iran obviously has no law against holocaust denial and therefore if irving or anyone else speaks there they will not be punished , " gable said .
" irving can not be punished in any other country for denying the holocaust in one with no laws against it .

german opposition parties have called for a formal parliamentary probe into the country 's foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- affair .
but what can the bnd divulge and what rights does the inquiry committee even have ? allegations that the german foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- shared intelligence with the united states during the iraq war cast doubt on former chancellor gerhard schröder 's highly popular opposition to the invasion . the explosive topic raises the question , though , as to what extent bnd employees are even allowed to testify before the committee .
and , do they have to ? at the same time , it 's questionable whether a parliamentary inquiry into this issue is even necessary .
after all , the parliamentary control board pkg already holds a controlling function over the various intelligence services . the rights a n d respo n sibilities of a n i n quiry committee an inquiry committee is a parliamentary information and control board .
its main task is reviewing alleged abuses in the government and administration or political misconduct . according to the constitution , it can be called up if one-quarter of the bundestag are in favor of one .
with the current parliamentary distribution , the three opposition factions have the possibility to call for such an inquiry committee to clear up the bnd-iraq affair .
the committee 's makeup is determined according to the factions ' respective sizes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier know ?
should an inquiry committee be called , it has the right to meet in closed sessions .
legally , witnesses are obligated to appear before the committee if summoned to do so .
this is also the case for bnd staff - in principle .
even if no criminal measures can be taken due to the committee 's conclusions , it is legally possible to order a compulsory showing of witnesses . however , this obligation does not apply to the bnd .
the intelligence service can retain witnesses under reference to national security interests , said bärbel schubert , press officer for the bundestag .
it is legally unclear what subsequently happens in such cases .
it is certain , though , that the inquiry committee can only deliberate on the justification for the witness withholding , but can not object to the bnd 's decision . bnd a n d co n trol boards n eed each other ultimately , the bnd decides what could endanger national security , not the parliamentary committee .
even if bnd employees would testify , the bundestag would not have to be informed of all the details . attorney alexander hirsch , author of the book " the control of the intelligence services , " said that , on the one hand , the bnd 's secrecy was justified .
on the other hand , the parliament had the right to be informed .
hirsch said that both the control boards and the bnd needed each other and that an interdependency between the two existed . hirsch said that the bnd would soon have a problem with public acceptance if it did not allow itself to be controlled and just sparked negative headlines .
that is why the bnd was dependent on control . " if the bnd forbid its staff from testifying , this would also have informative value , even if it would n't satisfy the opposition , " said hirsch .
the bnd should therefore consider its actions carefully , he said . usi n g i n quiries for political aims the parliamentary committee is considered to be the strongest weapon of the opposition .
that the opposition is demanding both a transparent parliamentary control board , even though it is subject to secrecy , as well as calling for an inquiry committee certainly has other reasons . hirsch said that the inquiry committee had deviated from its actual purpose and is used by the opposition for campaign objectives . already in 1995 , bnd actions led to a parliamentary inquiry .
at the time , it was leaked that the successful arrest of a columbian plutonium dealer at the munich airport in august 1994 had been staged .
the bnd , the bavarian criminal police office and the bavarian judiciary system were all involved . the arrest was aimed to demonstrate a politically useful manhunt in the run-up to bavarian and federal elections .

many of them voiced their anger and frustration on the streets of berlin , while smaller protest actions took place in other big cities across the country .

" this is international anti-semitism at work , " said gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in an interview with german magazine der spiegel .
his parliamentary colleague , left party member norman paech , added that the conference was part of an on-going " strategy of provocation " being employed by the iranian government . werner hoyer from the free-market liberal free democratic party told der spiegel that the idea of the conference was " untenable " and that such a meeting of holocaust skeptics at a time of heightened tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions was a " dangerous spark in the powder keg . " ahmadi n ejad spreadi n g a n ti-semitic doctri n e , claims gree n chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer warned a conference would further isolate iran .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer said that the planned conference was further evidence that president mahmoud ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran .
president ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " and has questioned the right of israel to exist . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . "
everybody which gets involved in anti-semitism or racism soils its own culture and nation , he added .
" this also applies to iran . " weisskirchen meanwhile cautioned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously .
he added that ahmadinejad was trying to validate his stance on denial by inviting well-known authorities on the subject . " ahmadinejad apparently now tries to give a quasi-scientific meaning to his rhetoric , " weisskirchen said . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .

irving held two speeches in austria that year , during which he allegedly claimed there had been no gas chambers at auschwitz . however , gerry gable , the former editor of anti-fascist magazine searchlight and an authority on irving told dw-world that if irving escapes prosecution in austria , he and his fellow speakers will be free to travel to the middle east to speak with impunity . " iran obviously has no law against holocaust denial and therefore if irving or anyone else speaks there they will not be punished , " gable said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2006 german doctors protest against pay conditions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the system is sick " claims this and many more german doctors over 20,000 doctors from hospitals and private practices all over germany took to the streets wednesday to protest against poor salaries and bureaucracy in the statutory health system . most german doctors are no longer willing to accept what they refer to as the adverse funding conditions in the statutory health system .
many of them voiced their anger and frustration on the streets of berlin , while smaller protest actions took place in other big cities across the country .
tens of thousands of practices were shut nationwide . andreas schulz , a general practitioner in lower saxony and one of the protesters in berlin , hoped that wednesday 's protest would have an impact on germany 's politicians . " we definitely think that with our action today and following action we are able to change the existing conditions .
the leading politicians , including our new chancellor merkel , will have to listen to the doctors , because otherwise the patient care will go down in germany . " the restricted funding policy pursued by statutory health funds and endorsed by the government does not only mean less money for the treatment of patients but also less money in doctors ' pockets at the end of the day .
doctors are forced to observe ceilings on what they spend on their patients or face financial penalties themselves . " the amount of money the health insurance funds give to the doctors is very strictly budgeted , " explained hans-jörg freese , a spokesman for the german medical association . health insurance funds decide fees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors say they have been inadequately paid for a decade " we have a different system when you compare it with other countries like britain , where you have a state financed system .
in germany we have health insurance funds , and they have to decide and negotiate with the doctors the amount of money they give for the healthcare system .
and we have had low wages over the last 10 years in germany . " health minister ulla schmidt has shown little sympathy for the doctors .
she has said that doctors have less to complain about than they would have us believe .
she does n't subscribe to the view that doctors are paid too little , insisting that their incomes are above the average earnings of german academics . politicians have no grip on realistic figures , say doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors and nurses are blowing the whistle on their pay conditions but andreas schulz said the minister did n't know what she was talking about .
" the politicians do not understand hospital funding , and they definitely do n't understand funding of the practices outside the hospital , " the doctor said .

" this is international anti-semitism at work , " said gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in an interview with german magazine der spiegel .
his parliamentary colleague , left party member norman paech , added that the conference was part of an on-going " strategy of provocation " being employed by the iranian government . werner hoyer from the free-market liberal free democratic party told der spiegel that the idea of the conference was " untenable " and that such a meeting of holocaust skeptics at a time of heightened tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions was a " dangerous spark in the powder keg . " ahmadi n ejad spreadi n g a n ti-semitic doctri n e , claims gree n chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer warned a conference would further isolate iran .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer said that the planned conference was further evidence that president mahmoud ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran .
president ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " and has questioned the right of israel to exist . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . "
everybody which gets involved in anti-semitism or racism soils its own culture and nation , he added .
" this also applies to iran . " weisskirchen meanwhile cautioned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously .
he added that ahmadinejad was trying to validate his stance on denial by inviting well-known authorities on the subject . " ahmadinejad apparently now tries to give a quasi-scientific meaning to his rhetoric , " weisskirchen said . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .

british historian david irving is currently awaiting trial in austria on charges of holocaust denial and faces a possible sentence of between one to 10 years in prison if found guilty . irving , whose trial begins on feb .
20 , was arrested in the southern province of styria in november under a warrant issued in 1989 .
irving held two speeches in austria that year , during which he allegedly claimed there had been no gas chambers at auschwitz . however , gerry gable , the former editor of anti-fascist magazine searchlight and an authority on irving told dw-world that if irving escapes prosecution in austria , he and his fellow speakers will be free to travel to the middle east to speak with impunity . " iran obviously has no law against holocaust denial and therefore if irving or anyone else speaks there they will not be punished , " gable said .
" irving can not be punished in any other country for denying the holocaust in one with no laws against it .

" i am in favor of a general liberalization of markets and port services , but i can not support this proposal , " said liberal josu ortuondo larrea . deputies from all political parties in the european parliament had lined up earlier in the week to denounce the plans as threatening dock workers ' jobs by opening up ports to more competition , including from companies outside the european union . " i believe this text belongs in the dockside rubbish container , and i hope that is where it will end up after we reject it , " said socialist willi piecyk on tuesday .
" i have n't heard a single argument which justifies endangering these jobs , " he added . rejected pla n had bee n ame n ded from last vetoed draft bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's back to the drawing board for barrot 's port proposals .
eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , defending his plans , said he would " draw the necessary conclusions " from the vote .
he said amendments suggested by the parliament at an earlier stage had already been included . " the improvements brought by parliament were excellent , and allowed us to respond to some justified criticisms of the text , " he said . the rejected plan was the second attempt by the european commission , after eu lawmakers rejected a first version in november 2003 . europe 's dock workers fear the liberalization plans , which seek to let more firms compete for work , could cost thousands of jobs in a sector that handles the vast majority of europe 's exports . one point that had drawn particular ire from the dockers is a proposal for so-called " self handling , " meaning that crew on vessels could load and unload their own cargo , taking work away from europe 's relatively costly dock workers . dockers make feeli n gs clear through strikes a n d viole n ce in a day of strikes monday , tens of thousands of dockers from copenhagen to lisbon and antwerp to piraeus walked off the job to protest against the proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry dock workers laid siege to the european parliament in strasbourg .
on the same day thousands of dockers demonstrated in strasbourg , clashing with police outside the eu assembly in a confrontation that left 64 officers hurt and caused hundreds of thousands of euros ' worth of damage to the building itself , according to police authorities . officials said at least 200 square meters -lrb- 2,150 square feet -rrb- of windows were smashed when demonstrators hurled rocks and bottles at the parliament building . police fired tear gas grenades in a bid to curb the unrest , said authorities , who put the number of demonstrators at 6,200 .

will his visit be overshadowed by reports that german secret agents aided the us in the war on iraq ? steinmeier 's first visit to the region was n't meant to be much more than a get-to-know-you session with the key players in the region .
now , it wo n't even be that .
the foreign minister was forced to cut the planned four-day trip in half , meaning that instead of stopping in israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , he will only visit egypt on wednesday and thursday . the reason for the change in plans is also the reason why the trip has been attracting the scrutiny of the german press - a potential intelligence scandal involving german secret agents in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investigating reports that bnd agents aided the us in iraq reports began surfacing last week that german bnd foreign intelligence agents may have helped american forces select bombing targets during the 2003 invasion of iraq .
both steinmeier and former defense minister peter struck have denied the reports , which would go against germany 's claims that it took no active part in the war . a parliamentary debate on the bnd 's role during the iraq war will be held on friday , and a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry said that steinmeier intends to take part .
steinmeier will return from egypt to attend the debate . there was speculation that the intelligence affair would have overshadowed steinmeier 's trip , although udo steinbach , head of the hamburg-based german orient institute told dw-world that the issue has n't been ruffling feathers in the arab world .

" this has attracted much more attention , " steinbach said .
" this is one point that could probably be brought up with the foreign minister in egypt .
missiles with a far range , possibly even nuclear warheads , can be mounted on these submarines , and this could create difficulties for germany when it comes to its role as the honest broker .

" if he is asked about it , he could do damage control , " steinbach said . steinmeier 's first appointment in cairo is with his egyptian counterpart , ahmed abul gheit .
a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak is planned for the following day . while in egypt , steinmeier will also attend the opening of the cairo international book fair , at which germany is a guest of honor .
the event should " reassure the arab world of the significance germany attaches to cultural exchanges with the arab world , " said steinmeier 's spokesman , martin jäger . merkel to visit israel steinmeier now has to wait to make his first visit to israel - a country that his predecessor joschka fischer visited 15 times during his tenure as foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke out in support of israel during her recent visit to washington but israel wo n't have to wait long to make its first formal acquaintance with the new german government .

" it was a conference of commitment and pledging that really showed solidarity , " the un 's coordinator on avian and human influenza , david nabarro , told reporters at the end of the conference .
" we 've got a fantastic set of pledges from poor countries as well as rich countries .
even countries that can not put money into the funding are saying we are going to commit our people and our governments to get the results . " the european commissioner for health and consumer safety , markos kyprianou , said nearly $ 1 billion had been pledged in grants , which would go mainly to low-income countries in southeast asia and africa .
the other $ 900 million would come in loans , he said .
us do n ates most the united states was the biggest donor , pledging $ 334 million , followed by the european union , which said it would offer $ 260 million .
within the eu , $ 138 million will come directly from the 25 member states while the european commission will deliver another $ 121 million .
japan committed $ 159 million to the global fight , while russia pledged $ 44.9 million and australia committed itself to $ 41.7 million .
china , which co-hosted the event along with the world bank and the european commission , pledged $ 10 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world is unprepared for a bird flu pandemic , un chief annan said the higher-than-expected pledges came after the conference was told repeatedly of the immense dangers for the world posed by the bird flu virus , which has killed around 80 people since re-emerging in 2003 .
with the virus spreading from asia to the middle east and now to europe in the past year , the world fears bird flu could become a pandemic that could kill millions . un secretary general kofi annan told the conference via video link that the world was not prepared for a pandemic and called for major efforts in stepping up preparations . " there 's no time to waste , " annan said .
" let 's ensure we 're ready .
we are not yet there .
to be truly prepared we would need to mount a tremendous effort . "
all cou n tries face threat with the disease killing four people in turkey this month , the first deaths outside southeast asia and china , the conference heard that the virus was capable of spreading easily across borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the money pledged will go to slaughtering and vaccinated poultry " all countries can be affected if a pandemic occurs , " world bank president paul wolfowitz said in a televised speech .
" all countries share responsibilities to fight the spread of the disease and to put human and financial resources behind the effort . " officials said the next step was to assess funding proposals from the needy countries and set up a system to ensure the money is well spent to implement a three-year action plan laid out at the first donors ' conference in geneva in november .
the plan aims to keep bird flu from moving from its current form , which is mainly transmitted from poultry to humans , to one that is transmissible among humans . most of the money will be spent on launching public awareness programs , strengthening outbreak detection and response , disinfection , slaughter and vaccination of poultry , and compensation for farmers .
money will also be used to stockpile drugs to treat bird flu victims and to prepare a currently non-existent vaccine . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the continuing threat read recent dw-world stories from the front line and the efforts of those attempting to stop the deadly h5n1 virus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2006 germany condemns proposed iranian holocaust conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " the iranian government 's announcement that it plans to hold a conference on the holocaust with notorious deniers as guests has caused outrage in germany . the iranian government announced last weekend that it is planning a conference on the holocaust and intends to invite academics such as german neo-nazi horst mahler , the israeli journalist and christian convert israel shamir and the historian david irving - all of whom are holocaust deniers - as guest speakers . while there was some debate among western officials immediately after the announcement was made as to whether the conference would actually take place or that it was intended to provoke , politicians , especially in germany , were up in arms at the idea of such a conference . " this is international anti-semitism at work , " said gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in an interview with german magazine der spiegel .
his parliamentary colleague , left party member norman paech , added that the conference was part of an on-going " strategy of provocation " being employed by the iranian government . werner hoyer from the free-market liberal free democratic party told der spiegel that the idea of the conference was " untenable " and that such a meeting of holocaust skeptics at a time of heightened tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions was a " dangerous spark in the powder keg . " ahmadi n ejad spreadi n g a n ti-semitic doctri n e , claims gree n chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer warned a conference would further isolate iran .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer said that the planned conference was further evidence that president mahmoud ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran .
president ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " and has questioned the right of israel to exist . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . "
everybody which gets involved in anti-semitism or racism soils its own culture and nation , he added .
" this also applies to iran . " weisskirchen meanwhile cautioned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously .
he added that ahmadinejad was trying to validate his stance on denial by inviting well-known authorities on the subject . " ahmadinejad apparently now tries to give a quasi-scientific meaning to his rhetoric , " weisskirchen said . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .
holocaust denial is a criminal offence in germany . irvi n g a n d others would be free to speak i n ira n with impu n ity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if freed from austria , irving would be able to speak in iran without restriction .
british historian david irving is currently awaiting trial in austria on charges of holocaust denial and faces a possible sentence of between one to 10 years in prison if found guilty . irving , whose trial begins on feb .
20 , was arrested in the southern province of styria in november under a warrant issued in 1989 .
irving held two speeches in austria that year , during which he allegedly claimed there had been no gas chambers at auschwitz . however , gerry gable , the former editor of anti-fascist magazine searchlight and an authority on irving told dw-world that if irving escapes prosecution in austria , he and his fellow speakers will be free to travel to the middle east to speak with impunity . " iran obviously has no law against holocaust denial and therefore if irving or anyone else speaks there they will not be punished , " gable said .
" irving can not be punished in any other country for denying the holocaust in one with no laws against it .

" this is international anti-semitism at work , " said gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in an interview with german magazine der spiegel .
his parliamentary colleague , left party member norman paech , added that the conference was part of an on-going " strategy of provocation " being employed by the iranian government . werner hoyer from the free-market liberal free democratic party told der spiegel that the idea of the conference was " untenable " and that such a meeting of holocaust skeptics at a time of heightened tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions was a " dangerous spark in the powder keg .

green party chief reinhard bütikofer said that the planned conference was further evidence that president mahmoud ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran .
president ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " and has questioned the right of israel to exist . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . "
everybody which gets involved in anti-semitism or racism soils its own culture and nation , he added .
" this also applies to iran . " weisskirchen meanwhile cautioned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously .
he added that ahmadinejad was trying to validate his stance on denial by inviting well-known authorities on the subject . " ahmadinejad apparently now tries to give a quasi-scientific meaning to his rhetoric , " weisskirchen said . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .

british historian david irving is currently awaiting trial in austria on charges of holocaust denial and faces a possible sentence of between one to 10 years in prison if found guilty . irving , whose trial begins on feb .
20 , was arrested in the southern province of styria in november under a warrant issued in 1989 .
irving held two speeches in austria that year , during which he allegedly claimed there had been no gas chambers at auschwitz . however , gerry gable , the former editor of anti-fascist magazine searchlight and an authority on irving told dw-world that if irving escapes prosecution in austria , he and his fellow speakers will be free to travel to the middle east to speak with impunity . " iran obviously has no law against holocaust denial and therefore if irving or anyone else speaks there they will not be punished , " gable said .
" irving can not be punished in any other country for denying the holocaust in one with no laws against it .

" this is international anti-semitism at work , " said gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in an interview with german magazine der spiegel .
his parliamentary colleague , left party member norman paech , added that the conference was part of an on-going " strategy of provocation " being employed by the iranian government . werner hoyer from the free-market liberal free democratic party told der spiegel that the idea of the conference was " untenable " and that such a meeting of holocaust skeptics at a time of heightened tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions was a " dangerous spark in the powder keg . " ahmadi n ejad spreadi n g a n ti-semitic doctri n e , claims gree n chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer warned a conference would further isolate iran .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer said that the planned conference was further evidence that president mahmoud ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran .
president ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " and has questioned the right of israel to exist . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . "
everybody which gets involved in anti-semitism or racism soils its own culture and nation , he added .
" this also applies to iran . " weisskirchen meanwhile cautioned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously .
he added that ahmadinejad was trying to validate his stance on denial by inviting well-known authorities on the subject . " ahmadinejad apparently now tries to give a quasi-scientific meaning to his rhetoric , " weisskirchen said . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .

many of them voiced their anger and frustration on the streets of berlin , while smaller protest actions took place in other big cities across the country .
tens of thousands of practices were shut nationwide . andreas schulz , a general practitioner in lower saxony and one of the protesters in berlin , hoped that wednesday 's protest would have an impact on germany 's politicians . " we definitely think that with our action today and following action we are able to change the existing conditions .
the leading politicians , including our new chancellor merkel , will have to listen to the doctors , because otherwise the patient care will go down in germany . " the restricted funding policy pursued by statutory health funds and endorsed by the government does not only mean less money for the treatment of patients but also less money in doctors ' pockets at the end of the day .
doctors are forced to observe ceilings on what they spend on their patients or face financial penalties themselves . " the amount of money the health insurance funds give to the doctors is very strictly budgeted , " explained hans-jörg freese , a spokesman for the german medical association . health insurance funds decide fees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors say they have been inadequately paid for a decade " we have a different system when you compare it with other countries like britain , where you have a state financed system .
in germany we have health insurance funds , and they have to decide and negotiate with the doctors the amount of money they give for the healthcare system .
and we have had low wages over the last 10 years in germany . " health minister ulla schmidt has shown little sympathy for the doctors .

" i am in favor of a general liberalization of markets and port services , but i can not support this proposal , " said liberal josu ortuondo larrea . deputies from all political parties in the european parliament had lined up earlier in the week to denounce the plans as threatening dock workers ' jobs by opening up ports to more competition , including from companies outside the european union . " i believe this text belongs in the dockside rubbish container , and i hope that is where it will end up after we reject it , " said socialist willi piecyk on tuesday .
" i have n't heard a single argument which justifies endangering these jobs , " he added . rejected pla n had bee n ame n ded from last vetoed draft bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's back to the drawing board for barrot 's port proposals .
eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , defending his plans , said he would " draw the necessary conclusions " from the vote .
he said amendments suggested by the parliament at an earlier stage had already been included .

on the same day thousands of dockers demonstrated in strasbourg , clashing with police outside the eu assembly in a confrontation that left 64 officers hurt and caused hundreds of thousands of euros ' worth of damage to the building itself , according to police authorities . officials said at least 200 square meters -lrb- 2,150 square feet -rrb- of windows were smashed when demonstrators hurled rocks and bottles at the parliament building . police fired tear gas grenades in a bid to curb the unrest , said authorities , who put the number of demonstrators at 6,200 .

german opposition parties have called for a formal parliamentary probe into the country 's foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- affair .
but what can the bnd divulge and what rights does the inquiry committee even have ? allegations that the german foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- shared intelligence with the united states during the iraq war cast doubt on former chancellor gerhard schröder 's highly popular opposition to the invasion . the explosive topic raises the question , though , as to what extent bnd employees are even allowed to testify before the committee .

its main task is reviewing alleged abuses in the government and administration or political misconduct . according to the constitution , it can be called up if one-quarter of the bundestag are in favor of one .

the committee 's makeup is determined according to the factions ' respective sizes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier know ?
should an inquiry committee be called , it has the right to meet in closed sessions .
legally , witnesses are obligated to appear before the committee if summoned to do so .
this is also the case for bnd staff - in principle .
even if no criminal measures can be taken due to the committee 's conclusions , it is legally possible to order a compulsory showing of witnesses . however , this obligation does not apply to the bnd .
the intelligence service can retain witnesses under reference to national security interests , said bärbel schubert , press officer for the bundestag .
it is legally unclear what subsequently happens in such cases .
it is certain , though , that the inquiry committee can only deliberate on the justification for the witness withholding , but can not object to the bnd 's decision . bnd a n d co n trol boards n eed each other ultimately , the bnd decides what could endanger national security , not the parliamentary committee .

on the other hand , the parliament had the right to be informed .
hirsch said that both the control boards and the bnd needed each other and that an interdependency between the two existed . hirsch said that the bnd would soon have a problem with public acceptance if it did not allow itself to be controlled and just sparked negative headlines .
that is why the bnd was dependent on control . " if the bnd forbid its staff from testifying , this would also have informative value , even if it would n't satisfy the opposition , " said hirsch .
the bnd should therefore consider its actions carefully , he said . usi n g i n quiries for political aims the parliamentary committee is considered to be the strongest weapon of the opposition .
that the opposition is demanding both a transparent parliamentary control board , even though it is subject to secrecy , as well as calling for an inquiry committee certainly has other reasons . hirsch said that the inquiry committee had deviated from its actual purpose and is used by the opposition for campaign objectives . already in 1995 , bnd actions led to a parliamentary inquiry .
at the time , it was leaked that the successful arrest of a columbian plutonium dealer at the munich airport in august 1994 had been staged .
the bnd , the bavarian criminal police office and the bavarian judiciary system were all involved . the arrest was aimed to demonstrate a politically useful manhunt in the run-up to bavarian and federal elections .

german opposition parties have called for a formal parliamentary probe into the country 's foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- affair .
but what can the bnd divulge and what rights does the inquiry committee even have ? allegations that the german foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- shared intelligence with the united states during the iraq war cast doubt on former chancellor gerhard schröder 's highly popular opposition to the invasion . the explosive topic raises the question , though , as to what extent bnd employees are even allowed to testify before the committee .
and , do they have to ? at the same time , it 's questionable whether a parliamentary inquiry into this issue is even necessary .
after all , the parliamentary control board pkg already holds a controlling function over the various intelligence services . the rights a n d respo n sibilities of a n i n quiry committee an inquiry committee is a parliamentary information and control board .
its main task is reviewing alleged abuses in the government and administration or political misconduct . according to the constitution , it can be called up if one-quarter of the bundestag are in favor of one .
with the current parliamentary distribution , the three opposition factions have the possibility to call for such an inquiry committee to clear up the bnd-iraq affair .
the committee 's makeup is determined according to the factions ' respective sizes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier know ?
should an inquiry committee be called , it has the right to meet in closed sessions .
legally , witnesses are obligated to appear before the committee if summoned to do so .
this is also the case for bnd staff - in principle .
even if no criminal measures can be taken due to the committee 's conclusions , it is legally possible to order a compulsory showing of witnesses . however , this obligation does not apply to the bnd .
the intelligence service can retain witnesses under reference to national security interests , said bärbel schubert , press officer for the bundestag .
it is legally unclear what subsequently happens in such cases .
it is certain , though , that the inquiry committee can only deliberate on the justification for the witness withholding , but can not object to the bnd 's decision . bnd a n d co n trol boards n eed each other ultimately , the bnd decides what could endanger national security , not the parliamentary committee .
even if bnd employees would testify , the bundestag would not have to be informed of all the details . attorney alexander hirsch , author of the book " the control of the intelligence services , " said that , on the one hand , the bnd 's secrecy was justified .
on the other hand , the parliament had the right to be informed .
hirsch said that both the control boards and the bnd needed each other and that an interdependency between the two existed . hirsch said that the bnd would soon have a problem with public acceptance if it did not allow itself to be controlled and just sparked negative headlines .
that is why the bnd was dependent on control . " if the bnd forbid its staff from testifying , this would also have informative value , even if it would n't satisfy the opposition , " said hirsch .
the bnd should therefore consider its actions carefully , he said . usi n g i n quiries for political aims the parliamentary committee is considered to be the strongest weapon of the opposition .
that the opposition is demanding both a transparent parliamentary control board , even though it is subject to secrecy , as well as calling for an inquiry committee certainly has other reasons . hirsch said that the inquiry committee had deviated from its actual purpose and is used by the opposition for campaign objectives . already in 1995 , bnd actions led to a parliamentary inquiry .
at the time , it was leaked that the successful arrest of a columbian plutonium dealer at the munich airport in august 1994 had been staged .
the bnd , the bavarian criminal police office and the bavarian judiciary system were all involved . the arrest was aimed to demonstrate a politically useful manhunt in the run-up to bavarian and federal elections .
at the time , the bnd police informer rafael ferreras fernandez surprisingly testified before the so-called plutonium inquiry committee . lenz hörburger -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence affair forces steinmeier to shorten middle east trip german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has embarked on his first trip to the middle east .

" i am in favor of a general liberalization of markets and port services , but i can not support this proposal , " said liberal josu ortuondo larrea . deputies from all political parties in the european parliament had lined up earlier in the week to denounce the plans as threatening dock workers ' jobs by opening up ports to more competition , including from companies outside the european union . " i believe this text belongs in the dockside rubbish container , and i hope that is where it will end up after we reject it , " said socialist willi piecyk on tuesday .
" i have n't heard a single argument which justifies endangering these jobs , " he added . rejected pla n had bee n ame n ded from last vetoed draft bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's back to the drawing board for barrot 's port proposals .
eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , defending his plans , said he would " draw the necessary conclusions " from the vote .
he said amendments suggested by the parliament at an earlier stage had already been included . " the improvements brought by parliament were excellent , and allowed us to respond to some justified criticisms of the text , " he said . the rejected plan was the second attempt by the european commission , after eu lawmakers rejected a first version in november 2003 . europe 's dock workers fear the liberalization plans , which seek to let more firms compete for work , could cost thousands of jobs in a sector that handles the vast majority of europe 's exports . one point that had drawn particular ire from the dockers is a proposal for so-called " self handling , " meaning that crew on vessels could load and unload their own cargo , taking work away from europe 's relatively costly dock workers . dockers make feeli n gs clear through strikes a n d viole n ce in a day of strikes monday , tens of thousands of dockers from copenhagen to lisbon and antwerp to piraeus walked off the job to protest against the proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry dock workers laid siege to the european parliament in strasbourg .
on the same day thousands of dockers demonstrated in strasbourg , clashing with police outside the eu assembly in a confrontation that left 64 officers hurt and caused hundreds of thousands of euros ' worth of damage to the building itself , according to police authorities . officials said at least 200 square meters -lrb- 2,150 square feet -rrb- of windows were smashed when demonstrators hurled rocks and bottles at the parliament building . police fired tear gas grenades in a bid to curb the unrest , said authorities , who put the number of demonstrators at 6,200 .

german firms , already leaders in the field , are hoping to get a slice of the lucrative pie . when america 's most-populous state and the world 's fifth-largest economy decides to invest billions in an industry , chances are that the ramifications are felt far beyond us borders . that 's exactly what happened when state energy regulators in california last week approved the " california solar initiative , " the biggest incentive program for solar energy in the us so far .
it foresees providing $ 2.9 billion in consumer rebates for solar panels and installing 3,000 megawatts of solar electricity on the rooftops of one million homes , businesses and public buildings by 2017 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar ship , was built in germany within days of the announcement , the shares of german solar companies such as q-cells , conergy , ersol and solarworld shot up by an average 1.5 percent .
they also bagged the first four spots in the tec-dax technology share index in which almost half of all businesses are focused on the solar energy sector . a little bit of california sunshine and , that is n't the end of the story .
german companies , who have already established themselves as leaders in the solar energy industry , are hopeful that the new developments in california will have a positive ripple effect . " the program in california will secure the growth of the industry , " hartmuth schüning , head of the supervisory board at q-cells told berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week .
" for q-cells , the us will , in the long term , be the most important market after germany . " the view is echoed by frank asbeck , head of bonn-based solarworld , who said that his company had already received plum contracts from california totalling two-digit million figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station near munich germany is already one of the largest european markets for solar power , with state financing helping to support the sector by making roof-top solar panels affordable for households via subsidies . investor interest in solar energy has also been soaring after oil prices rose to record highs , increasing the attractiveness of renewable energy . foreign potential and challenges but most experts see foreign markets providing the most crucial potential for growth . the federal association of solar economy -lrb- bsw -rrb- estimates that german solar companies will register a 3-billion euro turnover abroad by 2010 . solarworld reckons that by the end of 2007 , its share of revenue in foreign markets will rise to 60 percent from the current 40 . in addition to the united states , greece , italy , portugal , spain , south korea and a few provinces in china are also investing in solar energy . spain , whose solar energy sector has increased threefold in the past year , and italy , where experts expect tenfold growth in the industry in 2006 , remain crucial markets for german solar companies . but german firms face challenges when it comes to sustaining their edge in the industry . asian companies , such as sharp , kyocera and sanyo , which discovered the power of the sun in tapping energy long before german firms , pose tough competition .
and even giant us multinationals such as bp , shell and general electric are investing massive sums in solar energy . a further problem hindering the growth of the photovoltaic industry is the lack of silica , a basic raw material needed in generating solar energy .
experts estimate that silica producers would need until 2007 to fulfill growing demand . rosy future in the long run , experts foresee a rosy future for the industry . " in the short term , the current share rises might seem a bit exaggerated , " patrick hummel , an analyst at the landesbank baden-württemberg told der tagesspiegel . " but the overall prospects for the sector are fantastic , " he said , adding that more countries needed to follow california 's example . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's solar explosion q-cells ag , a maker of solar cells , became the latest alternative energy company to make its debut on the german stock exchange on wednesday , with its shares showing warm gains on their first day of trading .

german firms , already leaders in the field , are hoping to get a slice of the lucrative pie . when america 's most-populous state and the world 's fifth-largest economy decides to invest billions in an industry , chances are that the ramifications are felt far beyond us borders . that 's exactly what happened when state energy regulators in california last week approved the " california solar initiative , " the biggest incentive program for solar energy in the us so far .
it foresees providing $ 2.9 billion in consumer rebates for solar panels and installing 3,000 megawatts of solar electricity on the rooftops of one million homes , businesses and public buildings by 2017 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar ship , was built in germany within days of the announcement , the shares of german solar companies such as q-cells , conergy , ersol and solarworld shot up by an average 1.5 percent .
they also bagged the first four spots in the tec-dax technology share index in which almost half of all businesses are focused on the solar energy sector . a little bit of california sunshine and , that is n't the end of the story .
german companies , who have already established themselves as leaders in the solar energy industry , are hopeful that the new developments in california will have a positive ripple effect . " the program in california will secure the growth of the industry , " hartmuth schüning , head of the supervisory board at q-cells told berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week .
" for q-cells , the us will , in the long term , be the most important market after germany . " the view is echoed by frank asbeck , head of bonn-based solarworld , who said that his company had already received plum contracts from california totalling two-digit million figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station near munich germany is already one of the largest european markets for solar power , with state financing helping to support the sector by making roof-top solar panels affordable for households via subsidies . investor interest in solar energy has also been soaring after oil prices rose to record highs , increasing the attractiveness of renewable energy . foreign potential and challenges but most experts see foreign markets providing the most crucial potential for growth . the federal association of solar economy -lrb- bsw -rrb- estimates that german solar companies will register a 3-billion euro turnover abroad by 2010 . solarworld reckons that by the end of 2007 , its share of revenue in foreign markets will rise to 60 percent from the current 40 . in addition to the united states , greece , italy , portugal , spain , south korea and a few provinces in china are also investing in solar energy . spain , whose solar energy sector has increased threefold in the past year , and italy , where experts expect tenfold growth in the industry in 2006 , remain crucial markets for german solar companies . but german firms face challenges when it comes to sustaining their edge in the industry . asian companies , such as sharp , kyocera and sanyo , which discovered the power of the sun in tapping energy long before german firms , pose tough competition .
and even giant us multinationals such as bp , shell and general electric are investing massive sums in solar energy . a further problem hindering the growth of the photovoltaic industry is the lack of silica , a basic raw material needed in generating solar energy .
experts estimate that silica producers would need until 2007 to fulfill growing demand . rosy future in the long run , experts foresee a rosy future for the industry . " in the short term , the current share rises might seem a bit exaggerated , " patrick hummel , an analyst at the landesbank baden-württemberg told der tagesspiegel . " but the overall prospects for the sector are fantastic , " he said , adding that more countries needed to follow california 's example . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's solar explosion q-cells ag , a maker of solar cells , became the latest alternative energy company to make its debut on the german stock exchange on wednesday , with its shares showing warm gains on their first day of trading .

will his visit be overshadowed by reports that german secret agents aided the us in the war on iraq ? steinmeier 's first visit to the region was n't meant to be much more than a get-to-know-you session with the key players in the region .
now , it wo n't even be that .
the foreign minister was forced to cut the planned four-day trip in half , meaning that instead of stopping in israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , he will only visit egypt on wednesday and thursday . the reason for the change in plans is also the reason why the trip has been attracting the scrutiny of the german press - a potential intelligence scandal involving german secret agents in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investigating reports that bnd agents aided the us in iraq reports began surfacing last week that german bnd foreign intelligence agents may have helped american forces select bombing targets during the 2003 invasion of iraq .
both steinmeier and former defense minister peter struck have denied the reports , which would go against germany 's claims that it took no active part in the war . a parliamentary debate on the bnd 's role during the iraq war will be held on friday , and a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry said that steinmeier intends to take part .
steinmeier will return from egypt to attend the debate . there was speculation that the intelligence affair would have overshadowed steinmeier 's trip , although udo steinbach , head of the hamburg-based german orient institute told dw-world that the issue has n't been ruffling feathers in the arab world . " as long as the facts are n't clear , i do n't think that the arab world would have any great interest in the affair , " said steinbach .
" the perception of germany in the arab world , in iraq , is not going to change . " israeli submarines a bigger hurdle steinbach said that the bigger hurdle for steinmeier was the fact that the previous government , in one of its last acts , had promised to sell two submarines to israel at a discounted price . " this has attracted much more attention , " steinbach said .
" this is one point that could probably be brought up with the foreign minister in egypt .
missiles with a far range , possibly even nuclear warheads , can be mounted on these submarines , and this could create difficulties for germany when it comes to its role as the honest broker . " steinbach said that while it 's not possible for the current government to step back from the promise , steinmeier can explain germany 's interests in the deal . " if he is asked about it , he could do damage control , " steinbach said . steinmeier 's first appointment in cairo is with his egyptian counterpart , ahmed abul gheit .
a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak is planned for the following day . while in egypt , steinmeier will also attend the opening of the cairo international book fair , at which germany is a guest of honor .
the event should " reassure the arab world of the significance germany attaches to cultural exchanges with the arab world , " said steinmeier 's spokesman , martin jäger . merkel to visit israel steinmeier now has to wait to make his first visit to israel - a country that his predecessor joschka fischer visited 15 times during his tenure as foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke out in support of israel during her recent visit to washington but israel wo n't have to wait long to make its first formal acquaintance with the new german government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 18.01.2006 putin 's parting gift gives merkel paws for thought großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after arriving back in berlin , putin 's gift was put straight to work outside the bundestag politics is a dog-eat-dog business where it pays to read between the lines .
so when russia 's president putin presented angela merkel with a stuffed toy puppy monday , her surprise may have been tempered with suspicion . angela merkel could be excused for scratching her head all the way back to berlin on her flight home from moscow after meeting with russian president vladimir putin this week . not only did putin give very mixed signals as to what , if any , support he would give merkel and the other eu leaders in the iranian nuclear stand-off , he also presented her with a strange parting gift . politicians and leaders are notorious for lavishing items such as rolex watches , jewelry , even expensive vacations on each other as way of a " thank you " for a state visit .
the extravagance of the present is often perceived as an indication as to the respect and admiration one has for the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you ai n't nothing like a hound dog : putin puts on the charm .
so one can only wonder where the german chancellor stands in putin 's esteem after being handed a small black and white toy dog that would not look out of place on the prize shelf at a fairground shooting gallery .
-lrb- in case you were wondering , yes , we fooled you with the picture above - the german sheperd had to do as a stand-in as merkel 's present is being kept under wraps . -rrb- while the two are unlikely to get as close as putin and merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , it is also unlikely that the stuffed animal is a reflection of the president 's opinion of the germany 's latest leader .
however , could it have been a coded political message ? a coded message of puti n 's hopes for the future ? maybe it meant that he expects frau merkel to follow obediently behind as he continues to ignore international pressure regarding russia 's human rights record .
or that the chancellor will be required to bare her teeth and growl at detractors in the eu who dare to mention russia 's continued involvement in chechnya .
or maybe he sees the pair of them just sitting cozily by the fire together in his black sea retreat . sadly the real reason behind the gift is likely to be less cryptic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't worry , angie .
it 's stuffed . "
according to german tabloid bild , the chancellor was bitten by a dog at a very young age and has been afraid of them ever since .
the paper suggests that president putin 's plush pooch has a gentler role to play in merkel 's life , helping her to get over her fear of canines . it could also be a sign that putin 's bark is worse than his bite .
could this be the start of some puppy love ? dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mean mama pooh-poohs pooches animal protection zealots would be the first to warn want-to-please parents not to buy pets for their youngsters ' stockings .

so when russia 's president putin presented angela merkel with a stuffed toy puppy monday , her surprise may have been tempered with suspicion . angela merkel could be excused for scratching her head all the way back to berlin on her flight home from moscow after meeting with russian president vladimir putin this week . not only did putin give very mixed signals as to what , if any , support he would give merkel and the other eu leaders in the iranian nuclear stand-off , he also presented her with a strange parting gift . politicians and leaders are notorious for lavishing items such as rolex watches , jewelry , even expensive vacations on each other as way of a " thank you " for a state visit .
the extravagance of the present is often perceived as an indication as to the respect and admiration one has for the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you ai n't nothing like a hound dog : putin puts on the charm .
so one can only wonder where the german chancellor stands in putin 's esteem after being handed a small black and white toy dog that would not look out of place on the prize shelf at a fairground shooting gallery .
-lrb- in case you were wondering , yes , we fooled you with the picture above - the german sheperd had to do as a stand-in as merkel 's present is being kept under wraps . -rrb- while the two are unlikely to get as close as putin and merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , it is also unlikely that the stuffed animal is a reflection of the president 's opinion of the germany 's latest leader .
however , could it have been a coded political message ? a coded message of puti n 's hopes for the future ? maybe it meant that he expects frau merkel to follow obediently behind as he continues to ignore international pressure regarding russia 's human rights record .
or that the chancellor will be required to bare her teeth and growl at detractors in the eu who dare to mention russia 's continued involvement in chechnya .
or maybe he sees the pair of them just sitting cozily by the fire together in his black sea retreat . sadly the real reason behind the gift is likely to be less cryptic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't worry , angie .
it 's stuffed . "
according to german tabloid bild , the chancellor was bitten by a dog at a very young age and has been afraid of them ever since .
the paper suggests that president putin 's plush pooch has a gentler role to play in merkel 's life , helping her to get over her fear of canines . it could also be a sign that putin 's bark is worse than his bite .
could this be the start of some puppy love ? dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mean mama pooh-poohs pooches animal protection zealots would be the first to warn want-to-please parents not to buy pets for their youngsters ' stockings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2006 what can a parliamentary inquiry accomplish in the bnd affair ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much can the bnd keep secret ?
german opposition parties have called for a formal parliamentary probe into the country 's foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- affair .
but what can the bnd divulge and what rights does the inquiry committee even have ? allegations that the german foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- shared intelligence with the united states during the iraq war cast doubt on former chancellor gerhard schröder 's highly popular opposition to the invasion . the explosive topic raises the question , though , as to what extent bnd employees are even allowed to testify before the committee .
and , do they have to ? at the same time , it 's questionable whether a parliamentary inquiry into this issue is even necessary .
after all , the parliamentary control board pkg already holds a controlling function over the various intelligence services . the rights a n d respo n sibilities of a n i n quiry committee an inquiry committee is a parliamentary information and control board .
its main task is reviewing alleged abuses in the government and administration or political misconduct . according to the constitution , it can be called up if one-quarter of the bundestag are in favor of one .
with the current parliamentary distribution , the three opposition factions have the possibility to call for such an inquiry committee to clear up the bnd-iraq affair .
the committee 's makeup is determined according to the factions ' respective sizes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier know ?
should an inquiry committee be called , it has the right to meet in closed sessions .
legally , witnesses are obligated to appear before the committee if summoned to do so .
this is also the case for bnd staff - in principle .
even if no criminal measures can be taken due to the committee 's conclusions , it is legally possible to order a compulsory showing of witnesses . however , this obligation does not apply to the bnd .
the intelligence service can retain witnesses under reference to national security interests , said bärbel schubert , press officer for the bundestag .
it is legally unclear what subsequently happens in such cases .
it is certain , though , that the inquiry committee can only deliberate on the justification for the witness withholding , but can not object to the bnd 's decision . bnd a n d co n trol boards n eed each other ultimately , the bnd decides what could endanger national security , not the parliamentary committee .
even if bnd employees would testify , the bundestag would not have to be informed of all the details . attorney alexander hirsch , author of the book " the control of the intelligence services , " said that , on the one hand , the bnd 's secrecy was justified .
on the other hand , the parliament had the right to be informed .
hirsch said that both the control boards and the bnd needed each other and that an interdependency between the two existed . hirsch said that the bnd would soon have a problem with public acceptance if it did not allow itself to be controlled and just sparked negative headlines .
that is why the bnd was dependent on control . " if the bnd forbid its staff from testifying , this would also have informative value , even if it would n't satisfy the opposition , " said hirsch .
the bnd should therefore consider its actions carefully , he said . usi n g i n quiries for political aims the parliamentary committee is considered to be the strongest weapon of the opposition .
that the opposition is demanding both a transparent parliamentary control board , even though it is subject to secrecy , as well as calling for an inquiry committee certainly has other reasons . hirsch said that the inquiry committee had deviated from its actual purpose and is used by the opposition for campaign objectives . already in 1995 , bnd actions led to a parliamentary inquiry .
at the time , it was leaked that the successful arrest of a columbian plutonium dealer at the munich airport in august 1994 had been staged .
the bnd , the bavarian criminal police office and the bavarian judiciary system were all involved . the arrest was aimed to demonstrate a politically useful manhunt in the run-up to bavarian and federal elections .
at the time , the bnd police informer rafael ferreras fernandez surprisingly testified before the so-called plutonium inquiry committee . lenz hörburger -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence affair forces steinmeier to shorten middle east trip german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has embarked on his first trip to the middle east .

" this is international anti-semitism at work , " said gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in an interview with german magazine der spiegel .
his parliamentary colleague , left party member norman paech , added that the conference was part of an on-going " strategy of provocation " being employed by the iranian government . werner hoyer from the free-market liberal free democratic party told der spiegel that the idea of the conference was " untenable " and that such a meeting of holocaust skeptics at a time of heightened tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions was a " dangerous spark in the powder keg .

green party chief reinhard bütikofer said that the planned conference was further evidence that president mahmoud ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran .
president ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " and has questioned the right of israel to exist . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . "
everybody which gets involved in anti-semitism or racism soils its own culture and nation , he added .
" this also applies to iran . " weisskirchen meanwhile cautioned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously .
he added that ahmadinejad was trying to validate his stance on denial by inviting well-known authorities on the subject . " ahmadinejad apparently now tries to give a quasi-scientific meaning to his rhetoric , " weisskirchen said . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .

" this is international anti-semitism at work , " said gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in an interview with german magazine der spiegel .
his parliamentary colleague , left party member norman paech , added that the conference was part of an on-going " strategy of provocation " being employed by the iranian government . werner hoyer from the free-market liberal free democratic party told der spiegel that the idea of the conference was " untenable " and that such a meeting of holocaust skeptics at a time of heightened tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions was a " dangerous spark in the powder keg . " ahmadi n ejad spreadi n g a n ti-semitic doctri n e , claims gree n chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer warned a conference would further isolate iran .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer said that the planned conference was further evidence that president mahmoud ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran .
president ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " and has questioned the right of israel to exist . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . "
everybody which gets involved in anti-semitism or racism soils its own culture and nation , he added .
" this also applies to iran . " weisskirchen meanwhile cautioned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously .
he added that ahmadinejad was trying to validate his stance on denial by inviting well-known authorities on the subject . " ahmadinejad apparently now tries to give a quasi-scientific meaning to his rhetoric , " weisskirchen said . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .
holocaust denial is a criminal offence in germany . irvi n g a n d others would be free to speak i n ira n with impu n ity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if freed from austria , irving would be able to speak in iran without restriction .
british historian david irving is currently awaiting trial in austria on charges of holocaust denial and faces a possible sentence of between one to 10 years in prison if found guilty . irving , whose trial begins on feb .
20 , was arrested in the southern province of styria in november under a warrant issued in 1989 .
irving held two speeches in austria that year , during which he allegedly claimed there had been no gas chambers at auschwitz . however , gerry gable , the former editor of anti-fascist magazine searchlight and an authority on irving told dw-world that if irving escapes prosecution in austria , he and his fellow speakers will be free to travel to the middle east to speak with impunity . " iran obviously has no law against holocaust denial and therefore if irving or anyone else speaks there they will not be punished , " gable said .

" i am in favor of a general liberalization of markets and port services , but i can not support this proposal , " said liberal josu ortuondo larrea . deputies from all political parties in the european parliament had lined up earlier in the week to denounce the plans as threatening dock workers ' jobs by opening up ports to more competition , including from companies outside the european union . " i believe this text belongs in the dockside rubbish container , and i hope that is where it will end up after we reject it , " said socialist willi piecyk on tuesday .
" i have n't heard a single argument which justifies endangering these jobs , " he added . rejected pla n had bee n ame n ded from last vetoed draft bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's back to the drawing board for barrot 's port proposals .
eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , defending his plans , said he would " draw the necessary conclusions " from the vote .
he said amendments suggested by the parliament at an earlier stage had already been included . " the improvements brought by parliament were excellent , and allowed us to respond to some justified criticisms of the text , " he said . the rejected plan was the second attempt by the european commission , after eu lawmakers rejected a first version in november 2003 . europe 's dock workers fear the liberalization plans , which seek to let more firms compete for work , could cost thousands of jobs in a sector that handles the vast majority of europe 's exports . one point that had drawn particular ire from the dockers is a proposal for so-called " self handling , " meaning that crew on vessels could load and unload their own cargo , taking work away from europe 's relatively costly dock workers . dockers make feeli n gs clear through strikes a n d viole n ce in a day of strikes monday , tens of thousands of dockers from copenhagen to lisbon and antwerp to piraeus walked off the job to protest against the proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry dock workers laid siege to the european parliament in strasbourg .
on the same day thousands of dockers demonstrated in strasbourg , clashing with police outside the eu assembly in a confrontation that left 64 officers hurt and caused hundreds of thousands of euros ' worth of damage to the building itself , according to police authorities . officials said at least 200 square meters -lrb- 2,150 square feet -rrb- of windows were smashed when demonstrators hurled rocks and bottles at the parliament building . police fired tear gas grenades in a bid to curb the unrest , said authorities , who put the number of demonstrators at 6,200 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 18.01.2006 putin 's parting gift gives merkel paws for thought großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after arriving back in berlin , putin 's gift was put straight to work outside the bundestag politics is a dog-eat-dog business where it pays to read between the lines .
so when russia 's president putin presented angela merkel with a stuffed toy puppy monday , her surprise may have been tempered with suspicion . angela merkel could be excused for scratching her head all the way back to berlin on her flight home from moscow after meeting with russian president vladimir putin this week . not only did putin give very mixed signals as to what , if any , support he would give merkel and the other eu leaders in the iranian nuclear stand-off , he also presented her with a strange parting gift . politicians and leaders are notorious for lavishing items such as rolex watches , jewelry , even expensive vacations on each other as way of a " thank you " for a state visit .
the extravagance of the present is often perceived as an indication as to the respect and admiration one has for the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you ai n't nothing like a hound dog : putin puts on the charm .
so one can only wonder where the german chancellor stands in putin 's esteem after being handed a small black and white toy dog that would not look out of place on the prize shelf at a fairground shooting gallery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 18.01.2006 putin 's parting gift gives merkel paws for thought großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after arriving back in berlin , putin 's gift was put straight to work outside the bundestag politics is a dog-eat-dog business where it pays to read between the lines .
so when russia 's president putin presented angela merkel with a stuffed toy puppy monday , her surprise may have been tempered with suspicion . angela merkel could be excused for scratching her head all the way back to berlin on her flight home from moscow after meeting with russian president vladimir putin this week . not only did putin give very mixed signals as to what , if any , support he would give merkel and the other eu leaders in the iranian nuclear stand-off , he also presented her with a strange parting gift . politicians and leaders are notorious for lavishing items such as rolex watches , jewelry , even expensive vacations on each other as way of a " thank you " for a state visit .
the extravagance of the present is often perceived as an indication as to the respect and admiration one has for the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you ai n't nothing like a hound dog : putin puts on the charm .
so one can only wonder where the german chancellor stands in putin 's esteem after being handed a small black and white toy dog that would not look out of place on the prize shelf at a fairground shooting gallery .
-lrb- in case you were wondering , yes , we fooled you with the picture above - the german sheperd had to do as a stand-in as merkel 's present is being kept under wraps . -rrb- while the two are unlikely to get as close as putin and merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , it is also unlikely that the stuffed animal is a reflection of the president 's opinion of the germany 's latest leader .
however , could it have been a coded political message ? a coded message of puti n 's hopes for the future ? maybe it meant that he expects frau merkel to follow obediently behind as he continues to ignore international pressure regarding russia 's human rights record .
or that the chancellor will be required to bare her teeth and growl at detractors in the eu who dare to mention russia 's continued involvement in chechnya .
or maybe he sees the pair of them just sitting cozily by the fire together in his black sea retreat . sadly the real reason behind the gift is likely to be less cryptic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't worry , angie .
it 's stuffed . "
according to german tabloid bild , the chancellor was bitten by a dog at a very young age and has been afraid of them ever since .
the paper suggests that president putin 's plush pooch has a gentler role to play in merkel 's life , helping her to get over her fear of canines . it could also be a sign that putin 's bark is worse than his bite .
could this be the start of some puppy love ? dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mean mama pooh-poohs pooches animal protection zealots would be the first to warn want-to-please parents not to buy pets for their youngsters ' stockings .

will his visit be overshadowed by reports that german secret agents aided the us in the war on iraq ? steinmeier 's first visit to the region was n't meant to be much more than a get-to-know-you session with the key players in the region .
now , it wo n't even be that .
the foreign minister was forced to cut the planned four-day trip in half , meaning that instead of stopping in israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , he will only visit egypt on wednesday and thursday . the reason for the change in plans is also the reason why the trip has been attracting the scrutiny of the german press - a potential intelligence scandal involving german secret agents in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investigating reports that bnd agents aided the us in iraq reports began surfacing last week that german bnd foreign intelligence agents may have helped american forces select bombing targets during the 2003 invasion of iraq .
both steinmeier and former defense minister peter struck have denied the reports , which would go against germany 's claims that it took no active part in the war . a parliamentary debate on the bnd 's role during the iraq war will be held on friday , and a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry said that steinmeier intends to take part .
steinmeier will return from egypt to attend the debate . there was speculation that the intelligence affair would have overshadowed steinmeier 's trip , although udo steinbach , head of the hamburg-based german orient institute told dw-world that the issue has n't been ruffling feathers in the arab world . " as long as the facts are n't clear , i do n't think that the arab world would have any great interest in the affair , " said steinbach .
" the perception of germany in the arab world , in iraq , is not going to change . " israeli submarines a bigger hurdle steinbach said that the bigger hurdle for steinmeier was the fact that the previous government , in one of its last acts , had promised to sell two submarines to israel at a discounted price . " this has attracted much more attention , " steinbach said .
" this is one point that could probably be brought up with the foreign minister in egypt .
missiles with a far range , possibly even nuclear warheads , can be mounted on these submarines , and this could create difficulties for germany when it comes to its role as the honest broker . " steinbach said that while it 's not possible for the current government to step back from the promise , steinmeier can explain germany 's interests in the deal . " if he is asked about it , he could do damage control , " steinbach said . steinmeier 's first appointment in cairo is with his egyptian counterpart , ahmed abul gheit .
a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak is planned for the following day . while in egypt , steinmeier will also attend the opening of the cairo international book fair , at which germany is a guest of honor .
the event should " reassure the arab world of the significance germany attaches to cultural exchanges with the arab world , " said steinmeier 's spokesman , martin jäger . merkel to visit israel steinmeier now has to wait to make his first visit to israel - a country that his predecessor joschka fischer visited 15 times during his tenure as foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke out in support of israel during her recent visit to washington but israel wo n't have to wait long to make its first formal acquaintance with the new german government .
chancellor angela merkel is expected to visit israel in late january to reaffirm germany 's solidarity with the jewish state , especially in light of anti-israeli remarks made by iran 's president in recent months , calling for israel to be " wiped off the map " and referring to the holocaust as a myth . merkel has already made her support of israel clear .

the foreign minister was forced to cut the planned four-day trip in half , meaning that instead of stopping in israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , he will only visit egypt on wednesday and thursday . the reason for the change in plans is also the reason why the trip has been attracting the scrutiny of the german press - a potential intelligence scandal involving german secret agents in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investigating reports that bnd agents aided the us in iraq reports began surfacing last week that german bnd foreign intelligence agents may have helped american forces select bombing targets during the 2003 invasion of iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2006 german doctors protest against pay conditions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the system is sick " claims this and many more german doctors over 20,000 doctors from hospitals and private practices all over germany took to the streets wednesday to protest against poor salaries and bureaucracy in the statutory health system . most german doctors are no longer willing to accept what they refer to as the adverse funding conditions in the statutory health system .
many of them voiced their anger and frustration on the streets of berlin , while smaller protest actions took place in other big cities across the country .
tens of thousands of practices were shut nationwide . andreas schulz , a general practitioner in lower saxony and one of the protesters in berlin , hoped that wednesday 's protest would have an impact on germany 's politicians . " we definitely think that with our action today and following action we are able to change the existing conditions .
the leading politicians , including our new chancellor merkel , will have to listen to the doctors , because otherwise the patient care will go down in germany . " the restricted funding policy pursued by statutory health funds and endorsed by the government does not only mean less money for the treatment of patients but also less money in doctors ' pockets at the end of the day .
doctors are forced to observe ceilings on what they spend on their patients or face financial penalties themselves . " the amount of money the health insurance funds give to the doctors is very strictly budgeted , " explained hans-jörg freese , a spokesman for the german medical association . health insurance funds decide fees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors say they have been inadequately paid for a decade " we have a different system when you compare it with other countries like britain , where you have a state financed system .
in germany we have health insurance funds , and they have to decide and negotiate with the doctors the amount of money they give for the healthcare system .
and we have had low wages over the last 10 years in germany . " health minister ulla schmidt has shown little sympathy for the doctors .
she has said that doctors have less to complain about than they would have us believe .
she does n't subscribe to the view that doctors are paid too little , insisting that their incomes are above the average earnings of german academics . politicians have no grip on realistic figures , say doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors and nurses are blowing the whistle on their pay conditions but andreas schulz said the minister did n't know what she was talking about .
" the politicians do not understand hospital funding , and they definitely do n't understand funding of the practices outside the hospital , " the doctor said .
" they mention numbers that are valid about the turnover of funding inside and outside the hospitals , but the important thing is what is left for the individual doctor , for the individual practice , after everything has been paid . " the protesters are warning that more and more german doctors will leave the country , if conditions in the health system remain unchanged .
they point out that a third of all doctor 's practices are currently facing bankruptcy and that the number is even higher in rural areas . in many cases , nurses can no longer be employed full-time and the purchase of essential new equipment is postponed to avoid financial disaster . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin doctors demand better wages medical workers at europe 's largest university hospital started a week-long strike in berlin on monday , with more strikes being planned for december all over germany .

" the amount of money the health insurance funds give to the doctors is very strictly budgeted , " explained hans-jörg freese , a spokesman for the german medical association . health insurance funds decide fees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors say they have been inadequately paid for a decade " we have a different system when you compare it with other countries like britain , where you have a state financed system .
in germany we have health insurance funds , and they have to decide and negotiate with the doctors the amount of money they give for the healthcare system .
and we have had low wages over the last 10 years in germany . " health minister ulla schmidt has shown little sympathy for the doctors .
she has said that doctors have less to complain about than they would have us believe .
she does n't subscribe to the view that doctors are paid too little , insisting that their incomes are above the average earnings of german academics . politicians have no grip on realistic figures , say doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors and nurses are blowing the whistle on their pay conditions but andreas schulz said the minister did n't know what she was talking about .
" the politicians do not understand hospital funding , and they definitely do n't understand funding of the practices outside the hospital , " the doctor said .
" they mention numbers that are valid about the turnover of funding inside and outside the hospitals , but the important thing is what is left for the individual doctor , for the individual practice , after everything has been paid . " the protesters are warning that more and more german doctors will leave the country , if conditions in the health system remain unchanged .
they point out that a third of all doctor 's practices are currently facing bankruptcy and that the number is even higher in rural areas . in many cases , nurses can no longer be employed full-time and the purchase of essential new equipment is postponed to avoid financial disaster . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin doctors demand better wages medical workers at europe 's largest university hospital started a week-long strike in berlin on monday , with more strikes being planned for december all over germany .

should an inquiry committee be called , it has the right to meet in closed sessions .

this is also the case for bnd staff - in principle .
even if no criminal measures can be taken due to the committee 's conclusions , it is legally possible to order a compulsory showing of witnesses . however , this obligation does not apply to the bnd .
the intelligence service can retain witnesses under reference to national security interests , said bärbel schubert , press officer for the bundestag .

even if bnd employees would testify , the bundestag would not have to be informed of all the details . attorney alexander hirsch , author of the book " the control of the intelligence services , " said that , on the one hand , the bnd 's secrecy was justified .
on the other hand , the parliament had the right to be informed .
hirsch said that both the control boards and the bnd needed each other and that an interdependency between the two existed . hirsch said that the bnd would soon have a problem with public acceptance if it did not allow itself to be controlled and just sparked negative headlines .
that is why the bnd was dependent on control . " if the bnd forbid its staff from testifying , this would also have informative value , even if it would n't satisfy the opposition , " said hirsch .
the bnd should therefore consider its actions carefully , he said . usi n g i n quiries for political aims the parliamentary committee is considered to be the strongest weapon of the opposition .
that the opposition is demanding both a transparent parliamentary control board , even though it is subject to secrecy , as well as calling for an inquiry committee certainly has other reasons . hirsch said that the inquiry committee had deviated from its actual purpose and is used by the opposition for campaign objectives . already in 1995 , bnd actions led to a parliamentary inquiry .
at the time , it was leaked that the successful arrest of a columbian plutonium dealer at the munich airport in august 1994 had been staged .

german opposition parties have called for a formal parliamentary probe into the country 's foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- affair .
but what can the bnd divulge and what rights does the inquiry committee even have ? allegations that the german foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- shared intelligence with the united states during the iraq war cast doubt on former chancellor gerhard schröder 's highly popular opposition to the invasion . the explosive topic raises the question , though , as to what extent bnd employees are even allowed to testify before the committee .
and , do they have to ? at the same time , it 's questionable whether a parliamentary inquiry into this issue is even necessary .
after all , the parliamentary control board pkg already holds a controlling function over the various intelligence services . the rights a n d respo n sibilities of a n i n quiry committee an inquiry committee is a parliamentary information and control board .
its main task is reviewing alleged abuses in the government and administration or political misconduct . according to the constitution , it can be called up if one-quarter of the bundestag are in favor of one .
with the current parliamentary distribution , the three opposition factions have the possibility to call for such an inquiry committee to clear up the bnd-iraq affair .
the committee 's makeup is determined according to the factions ' respective sizes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier know ?
should an inquiry committee be called , it has the right to meet in closed sessions .
legally , witnesses are obligated to appear before the committee if summoned to do so .
this is also the case for bnd staff - in principle .
even if no criminal measures can be taken due to the committee 's conclusions , it is legally possible to order a compulsory showing of witnesses . however , this obligation does not apply to the bnd .
the intelligence service can retain witnesses under reference to national security interests , said bärbel schubert , press officer for the bundestag .
it is legally unclear what subsequently happens in such cases .
it is certain , though , that the inquiry committee can only deliberate on the justification for the witness withholding , but can not object to the bnd 's decision . bnd a n d co n trol boards n eed each other ultimately , the bnd decides what could endanger national security , not the parliamentary committee .

german opposition parties have called for a formal parliamentary probe into the country 's foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- affair .
but what can the bnd divulge and what rights does the inquiry committee even have ? allegations that the german foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- shared intelligence with the united states during the iraq war cast doubt on former chancellor gerhard schröder 's highly popular opposition to the invasion . the explosive topic raises the question , though , as to what extent bnd employees are even allowed to testify before the committee .
and , do they have to ? at the same time , it 's questionable whether a parliamentary inquiry into this issue is even necessary .
after all , the parliamentary control board pkg already holds a controlling function over the various intelligence services . the rights a n d respo n sibilities of a n i n quiry committee an inquiry committee is a parliamentary information and control board .
its main task is reviewing alleged abuses in the government and administration or political misconduct . according to the constitution , it can be called up if one-quarter of the bundestag are in favor of one .
with the current parliamentary distribution , the three opposition factions have the possibility to call for such an inquiry committee to clear up the bnd-iraq affair .
the committee 's makeup is determined according to the factions ' respective sizes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier know ?
should an inquiry committee be called , it has the right to meet in closed sessions .
legally , witnesses are obligated to appear before the committee if summoned to do so .
this is also the case for bnd staff - in principle .
even if no criminal measures can be taken due to the committee 's conclusions , it is legally possible to order a compulsory showing of witnesses . however , this obligation does not apply to the bnd .
the intelligence service can retain witnesses under reference to national security interests , said bärbel schubert , press officer for the bundestag .
it is legally unclear what subsequently happens in such cases .
it is certain , though , that the inquiry committee can only deliberate on the justification for the witness withholding , but can not object to the bnd 's decision . bnd a n d co n trol boards n eed each other ultimately , the bnd decides what could endanger national security , not the parliamentary committee .
even if bnd employees would testify , the bundestag would not have to be informed of all the details . attorney alexander hirsch , author of the book " the control of the intelligence services , " said that , on the one hand , the bnd 's secrecy was justified .
on the other hand , the parliament had the right to be informed .
hirsch said that both the control boards and the bnd needed each other and that an interdependency between the two existed . hirsch said that the bnd would soon have a problem with public acceptance if it did not allow itself to be controlled and just sparked negative headlines .
that is why the bnd was dependent on control . " if the bnd forbid its staff from testifying , this would also have informative value , even if it would n't satisfy the opposition , " said hirsch .
the bnd should therefore consider its actions carefully , he said . usi n g i n quiries for political aims the parliamentary committee is considered to be the strongest weapon of the opposition .
that the opposition is demanding both a transparent parliamentary control board , even though it is subject to secrecy , as well as calling for an inquiry committee certainly has other reasons . hirsch said that the inquiry committee had deviated from its actual purpose and is used by the opposition for campaign objectives . already in 1995 , bnd actions led to a parliamentary inquiry .
at the time , it was leaked that the successful arrest of a columbian plutonium dealer at the munich airport in august 1994 had been staged .
the bnd , the bavarian criminal police office and the bavarian judiciary system were all involved . the arrest was aimed to demonstrate a politically useful manhunt in the run-up to bavarian and federal elections .
at the time , the bnd police informer rafael ferreras fernandez surprisingly testified before the so-called plutonium inquiry committee . lenz hörburger -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence affair forces steinmeier to shorten middle east trip german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has embarked on his first trip to the middle east .

german firms , already leaders in the field , are hoping to get a slice of the lucrative pie . when america 's most-populous state and the world 's fifth-largest economy decides to invest billions in an industry , chances are that the ramifications are felt far beyond us borders . that 's exactly what happened when state energy regulators in california last week approved the " california solar initiative , " the biggest incentive program for solar energy in the us so far .
it foresees providing $ 2.9 billion in consumer rebates for solar panels and installing 3,000 megawatts of solar electricity on the rooftops of one million homes , businesses and public buildings by 2017 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar ship , was built in germany within days of the announcement , the shares of german solar companies such as q-cells , conergy , ersol and solarworld shot up by an average 1.5 percent .
they also bagged the first four spots in the tec-dax technology share index in which almost half of all businesses are focused on the solar energy sector . a little bit of california sunshine and , that is n't the end of the story .
german companies , who have already established themselves as leaders in the solar energy industry , are hopeful that the new developments in california will have a positive ripple effect . " the program in california will secure the growth of the industry , " hartmuth schüning , head of the supervisory board at q-cells told berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week .
" for q-cells , the us will , in the long term , be the most important market after germany . " the view is echoed by frank asbeck , head of bonn-based solarworld , who said that his company had already received plum contracts from california totalling two-digit million figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station near munich germany is already one of the largest european markets for solar power , with state financing helping to support the sector by making roof-top solar panels affordable for households via subsidies . investor interest in solar energy has also been soaring after oil prices rose to record highs , increasing the attractiveness of renewable energy . foreign potential and challenges but most experts see foreign markets providing the most crucial potential for growth . the federal association of solar economy -lrb- bsw -rrb- estimates that german solar companies will register a 3-billion euro turnover abroad by 2010 . solarworld reckons that by the end of 2007 , its share of revenue in foreign markets will rise to 60 percent from the current 40 . in addition to the united states , greece , italy , portugal , spain , south korea and a few provinces in china are also investing in solar energy . spain , whose solar energy sector has increased threefold in the past year , and italy , where experts expect tenfold growth in the industry in 2006 , remain crucial markets for german solar companies . but german firms face challenges when it comes to sustaining their edge in the industry . asian companies , such as sharp , kyocera and sanyo , which discovered the power of the sun in tapping energy long before german firms , pose tough competition .
and even giant us multinationals such as bp , shell and general electric are investing massive sums in solar energy . a further problem hindering the growth of the photovoltaic industry is the lack of silica , a basic raw material needed in generating solar energy .
experts estimate that silica producers would need until 2007 to fulfill growing demand . rosy future in the long run , experts foresee a rosy future for the industry . " in the short term , the current share rises might seem a bit exaggerated , " patrick hummel , an analyst at the landesbank baden-württemberg told der tagesspiegel .

the committee 's makeup is determined according to the factions ' respective sizes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier know ?
should an inquiry committee be called , it has the right to meet in closed sessions .
legally , witnesses are obligated to appear before the committee if summoned to do so .
this is also the case for bnd staff - in principle .
even if no criminal measures can be taken due to the committee 's conclusions , it is legally possible to order a compulsory showing of witnesses . however , this obligation does not apply to the bnd .
the intelligence service can retain witnesses under reference to national security interests , said bärbel schubert , press officer for the bundestag .
it is legally unclear what subsequently happens in such cases .
it is certain , though , that the inquiry committee can only deliberate on the justification for the witness withholding , but can not object to the bnd 's decision . bnd a n d co n trol boards n eed each other ultimately , the bnd decides what could endanger national security , not the parliamentary committee .
even if bnd employees would testify , the bundestag would not have to be informed of all the details . attorney alexander hirsch , author of the book " the control of the intelligence services , " said that , on the one hand , the bnd 's secrecy was justified .
on the other hand , the parliament had the right to be informed .
hirsch said that both the control boards and the bnd needed each other and that an interdependency between the two existed . hirsch said that the bnd would soon have a problem with public acceptance if it did not allow itself to be controlled and just sparked negative headlines .
that is why the bnd was dependent on control . " if the bnd forbid its staff from testifying , this would also have informative value , even if it would n't satisfy the opposition , " said hirsch .
the bnd should therefore consider its actions carefully , he said . usi n g i n quiries for political aims the parliamentary committee is considered to be the strongest weapon of the opposition .
that the opposition is demanding both a transparent parliamentary control board , even though it is subject to secrecy , as well as calling for an inquiry committee certainly has other reasons . hirsch said that the inquiry committee had deviated from its actual purpose and is used by the opposition for campaign objectives . already in 1995 , bnd actions led to a parliamentary inquiry .
at the time , it was leaked that the successful arrest of a columbian plutonium dealer at the munich airport in august 1994 had been staged .
the bnd , the bavarian criminal police office and the bavarian judiciary system were all involved . the arrest was aimed to demonstrate a politically useful manhunt in the run-up to bavarian and federal elections .
at the time , the bnd police informer rafael ferreras fernandez surprisingly testified before the so-called plutonium inquiry committee . lenz hörburger -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence affair forces steinmeier to shorten middle east trip german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has embarked on his first trip to the middle east .

" it was a conference of commitment and pledging that really showed solidarity , " the un 's coordinator on avian and human influenza , david nabarro , told reporters at the end of the conference .
" we 've got a fantastic set of pledges from poor countries as well as rich countries .
even countries that can not put money into the funding are saying we are going to commit our people and our governments to get the results . " the european commissioner for health and consumer safety , markos kyprianou , said nearly $ 1 billion had been pledged in grants , which would go mainly to low-income countries in southeast asia and africa .
the other $ 900 million would come in loans , he said .
us do n ates most the united states was the biggest donor , pledging $ 334 million , followed by the european union , which said it would offer $ 260 million .
within the eu , $ 138 million will come directly from the 25 member states while the european commission will deliver another $ 121 million .
japan committed $ 159 million to the global fight , while russia pledged $ 44.9 million and australia committed itself to $ 41.7 million .
china , which co-hosted the event along with the world bank and the european commission , pledged $ 10 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world is unprepared for a bird flu pandemic , un chief annan said the higher-than-expected pledges came after the conference was told repeatedly of the immense dangers for the world posed by the bird flu virus , which has killed around 80 people since re-emerging in 2003 .
with the virus spreading from asia to the middle east and now to europe in the past year , the world fears bird flu could become a pandemic that could kill millions . un secretary general kofi annan told the conference via video link that the world was not prepared for a pandemic and called for major efforts in stepping up preparations . " there 's no time to waste , " annan said .
" let 's ensure we 're ready .
we are not yet there .
to be truly prepared we would need to mount a tremendous effort . "

" all countries share responsibilities to fight the spread of the disease and to put human and financial resources behind the effort . " officials said the next step was to assess funding proposals from the needy countries and set up a system to ensure the money is well spent to implement a three-year action plan laid out at the first donors ' conference in geneva in november .
the plan aims to keep bird flu from moving from its current form , which is mainly transmitted from poultry to humans , to one that is transmissible among humans . most of the money will be spent on launching public awareness programs , strengthening outbreak detection and response , disinfection , slaughter and vaccination of poultry , and compensation for farmers .
money will also be used to stockpile drugs to treat bird flu victims and to prepare a currently non-existent vaccine . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the continuing threat read recent dw-world stories from the front line and the efforts of those attempting to stop the deadly h5n1 virus .

will his visit be overshadowed by reports that german secret agents aided the us in the war on iraq ? steinmeier 's first visit to the region was n't meant to be much more than a get-to-know-you session with the key players in the region .
now , it wo n't even be that .
the foreign minister was forced to cut the planned four-day trip in half , meaning that instead of stopping in israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , he will only visit egypt on wednesday and thursday . the reason for the change in plans is also the reason why the trip has been attracting the scrutiny of the german press - a potential intelligence scandal involving german secret agents in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investigating reports that bnd agents aided the us in iraq reports began surfacing last week that german bnd foreign intelligence agents may have helped american forces select bombing targets during the 2003 invasion of iraq .
both steinmeier and former defense minister peter struck have denied the reports , which would go against germany 's claims that it took no active part in the war . a parliamentary debate on the bnd 's role during the iraq war will be held on friday , and a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry said that steinmeier intends to take part .
steinmeier will return from egypt to attend the debate . there was speculation that the intelligence affair would have overshadowed steinmeier 's trip , although udo steinbach , head of the hamburg-based german orient institute told dw-world that the issue has n't been ruffling feathers in the arab world . " as long as the facts are n't clear , i do n't think that the arab world would have any great interest in the affair , " said steinbach .
" the perception of germany in the arab world , in iraq , is not going to change . " israeli submarines a bigger hurdle steinbach said that the bigger hurdle for steinmeier was the fact that the previous government , in one of its last acts , had promised to sell two submarines to israel at a discounted price . " this has attracted much more attention , " steinbach said .
" this is one point that could probably be brought up with the foreign minister in egypt .
missiles with a far range , possibly even nuclear warheads , can be mounted on these submarines , and this could create difficulties for germany when it comes to its role as the honest broker . " steinbach said that while it 's not possible for the current government to step back from the promise , steinmeier can explain germany 's interests in the deal . " if he is asked about it , he could do damage control , " steinbach said . steinmeier 's first appointment in cairo is with his egyptian counterpart , ahmed abul gheit .
a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak is planned for the following day . while in egypt , steinmeier will also attend the opening of the cairo international book fair , at which germany is a guest of honor .
the event should " reassure the arab world of the significance germany attaches to cultural exchanges with the arab world , " said steinmeier 's spokesman , martin jäger . merkel to visit israel steinmeier now has to wait to make his first visit to israel - a country that his predecessor joschka fischer visited 15 times during his tenure as foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke out in support of israel during her recent visit to washington but israel wo n't have to wait long to make its first formal acquaintance with the new german government .
chancellor angela merkel is expected to visit israel in late january to reaffirm germany 's solidarity with the jewish state , especially in light of anti-israeli remarks made by iran 's president in recent months , calling for israel to be " wiped off the map " and referring to the holocaust as a myth . merkel has already made her support of israel clear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 18.01.2006 putin 's parting gift gives merkel paws for thought großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after arriving back in berlin , putin 's gift was put straight to work outside the bundestag politics is a dog-eat-dog business where it pays to read between the lines .
so when russia 's president putin presented angela merkel with a stuffed toy puppy monday , her surprise may have been tempered with suspicion . angela merkel could be excused for scratching her head all the way back to berlin on her flight home from moscow after meeting with russian president vladimir putin this week . not only did putin give very mixed signals as to what , if any , support he would give merkel and the other eu leaders in the iranian nuclear stand-off , he also presented her with a strange parting gift . politicians and leaders are notorious for lavishing items such as rolex watches , jewelry , even expensive vacations on each other as way of a " thank you " for a state visit .
the extravagance of the present is often perceived as an indication as to the respect and admiration one has for the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you ai n't nothing like a hound dog : putin puts on the charm .
so one can only wonder where the german chancellor stands in putin 's esteem after being handed a small black and white toy dog that would not look out of place on the prize shelf at a fairground shooting gallery .
-lrb- in case you were wondering , yes , we fooled you with the picture above - the german sheperd had to do as a stand-in as merkel 's present is being kept under wraps . -rrb- while the two are unlikely to get as close as putin and merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , it is also unlikely that the stuffed animal is a reflection of the president 's opinion of the germany 's latest leader .
however , could it have been a coded political message ? a coded message of puti n 's hopes for the future ? maybe it meant that he expects frau merkel to follow obediently behind as he continues to ignore international pressure regarding russia 's human rights record .
or that the chancellor will be required to bare her teeth and growl at detractors in the eu who dare to mention russia 's continued involvement in chechnya .
or maybe he sees the pair of them just sitting cozily by the fire together in his black sea retreat . sadly the real reason behind the gift is likely to be less cryptic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't worry , angie .
it 's stuffed . "
according to german tabloid bild , the chancellor was bitten by a dog at a very young age and has been afraid of them ever since .
the paper suggests that president putin 's plush pooch has a gentler role to play in merkel 's life , helping her to get over her fear of canines . it could also be a sign that putin 's bark is worse than his bite .
could this be the start of some puppy love ? dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mean mama pooh-poohs pooches animal protection zealots would be the first to warn want-to-please parents not to buy pets for their youngsters ' stockings .

german opposition parties have called for a formal parliamentary probe into the country 's foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- affair .
but what can the bnd divulge and what rights does the inquiry committee even have ? allegations that the german foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- shared intelligence with the united states during the iraq war cast doubt on former chancellor gerhard schröder 's highly popular opposition to the invasion . the explosive topic raises the question , though , as to what extent bnd employees are even allowed to testify before the committee .
and , do they have to ? at the same time , it 's questionable whether a parliamentary inquiry into this issue is even necessary .
after all , the parliamentary control board pkg already holds a controlling function over the various intelligence services . the rights a n d respo n sibilities of a n i n quiry committee an inquiry committee is a parliamentary information and control board .
its main task is reviewing alleged abuses in the government and administration or political misconduct . according to the constitution , it can be called up if one-quarter of the bundestag are in favor of one .
with the current parliamentary distribution , the three opposition factions have the possibility to call for such an inquiry committee to clear up the bnd-iraq affair .
the committee 's makeup is determined according to the factions ' respective sizes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier know ?
should an inquiry committee be called , it has the right to meet in closed sessions .
legally , witnesses are obligated to appear before the committee if summoned to do so .
this is also the case for bnd staff - in principle .
even if no criminal measures can be taken due to the committee 's conclusions , it is legally possible to order a compulsory showing of witnesses . however , this obligation does not apply to the bnd .
the intelligence service can retain witnesses under reference to national security interests , said bärbel schubert , press officer for the bundestag .
it is legally unclear what subsequently happens in such cases .
it is certain , though , that the inquiry committee can only deliberate on the justification for the witness withholding , but can not object to the bnd 's decision . bnd a n d co n trol boards n eed each other ultimately , the bnd decides what could endanger national security , not the parliamentary committee .
even if bnd employees would testify , the bundestag would not have to be informed of all the details . attorney alexander hirsch , author of the book " the control of the intelligence services , " said that , on the one hand , the bnd 's secrecy was justified .
on the other hand , the parliament had the right to be informed .
hirsch said that both the control boards and the bnd needed each other and that an interdependency between the two existed . hirsch said that the bnd would soon have a problem with public acceptance if it did not allow itself to be controlled and just sparked negative headlines .
that is why the bnd was dependent on control . " if the bnd forbid its staff from testifying , this would also have informative value , even if it would n't satisfy the opposition , " said hirsch .
the bnd should therefore consider its actions carefully , he said . usi n g i n quiries for political aims the parliamentary committee is considered to be the strongest weapon of the opposition .
that the opposition is demanding both a transparent parliamentary control board , even though it is subject to secrecy , as well as calling for an inquiry committee certainly has other reasons . hirsch said that the inquiry committee had deviated from its actual purpose and is used by the opposition for campaign objectives . already in 1995 , bnd actions led to a parliamentary inquiry .
at the time , it was leaked that the successful arrest of a columbian plutonium dealer at the munich airport in august 1994 had been staged .
the bnd , the bavarian criminal police office and the bavarian judiciary system were all involved . the arrest was aimed to demonstrate a politically useful manhunt in the run-up to bavarian and federal elections .
at the time , the bnd police informer rafael ferreras fernandez surprisingly testified before the so-called plutonium inquiry committee . lenz hörburger -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence affair forces steinmeier to shorten middle east trip german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has embarked on his first trip to the middle east .

german opposition parties have called for a formal parliamentary probe into the country 's foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- affair .
but what can the bnd divulge and what rights does the inquiry committee even have ? allegations that the german foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- shared intelligence with the united states during the iraq war cast doubt on former chancellor gerhard schröder 's highly popular opposition to the invasion . the explosive topic raises the question , though , as to what extent bnd employees are even allowed to testify before the committee .
and , do they have to ? at the same time , it 's questionable whether a parliamentary inquiry into this issue is even necessary .
after all , the parliamentary control board pkg already holds a controlling function over the various intelligence services . the rights a n d respo n sibilities of a n i n quiry committee an inquiry committee is a parliamentary information and control board .
its main task is reviewing alleged abuses in the government and administration or political misconduct . according to the constitution , it can be called up if one-quarter of the bundestag are in favor of one .
with the current parliamentary distribution , the three opposition factions have the possibility to call for such an inquiry committee to clear up the bnd-iraq affair .
the committee 's makeup is determined according to the factions ' respective sizes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier know ?
should an inquiry committee be called , it has the right to meet in closed sessions .
legally , witnesses are obligated to appear before the committee if summoned to do so .
this is also the case for bnd staff - in principle .
even if no criminal measures can be taken due to the committee 's conclusions , it is legally possible to order a compulsory showing of witnesses . however , this obligation does not apply to the bnd .
the intelligence service can retain witnesses under reference to national security interests , said bärbel schubert , press officer for the bundestag .
it is legally unclear what subsequently happens in such cases .
it is certain , though , that the inquiry committee can only deliberate on the justification for the witness withholding , but can not object to the bnd 's decision . bnd a n d co n trol boards n eed each other ultimately , the bnd decides what could endanger national security , not the parliamentary committee .
even if bnd employees would testify , the bundestag would not have to be informed of all the details . attorney alexander hirsch , author of the book " the control of the intelligence services , " said that , on the one hand , the bnd 's secrecy was justified .
on the other hand , the parliament had the right to be informed .
hirsch said that both the control boards and the bnd needed each other and that an interdependency between the two existed . hirsch said that the bnd would soon have a problem with public acceptance if it did not allow itself to be controlled and just sparked negative headlines .
that is why the bnd was dependent on control . " if the bnd forbid its staff from testifying , this would also have informative value , even if it would n't satisfy the opposition , " said hirsch .
the bnd should therefore consider its actions carefully , he said . usi n g i n quiries for political aims the parliamentary committee is considered to be the strongest weapon of the opposition .
that the opposition is demanding both a transparent parliamentary control board , even though it is subject to secrecy , as well as calling for an inquiry committee certainly has other reasons . hirsch said that the inquiry committee had deviated from its actual purpose and is used by the opposition for campaign objectives . already in 1995 , bnd actions led to a parliamentary inquiry .
at the time , it was leaked that the successful arrest of a columbian plutonium dealer at the munich airport in august 1994 had been staged .
the bnd , the bavarian criminal police office and the bavarian judiciary system were all involved . the arrest was aimed to demonstrate a politically useful manhunt in the run-up to bavarian and federal elections .
at the time , the bnd police informer rafael ferreras fernandez surprisingly testified before the so-called plutonium inquiry committee . lenz hörburger -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence affair forces steinmeier to shorten middle east trip german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has embarked on his first trip to the middle east .

german firms , already leaders in the field , are hoping to get a slice of the lucrative pie . when america 's most-populous state and the world 's fifth-largest economy decides to invest billions in an industry , chances are that the ramifications are felt far beyond us borders . that 's exactly what happened when state energy regulators in california last week approved the " california solar initiative , " the biggest incentive program for solar energy in the us so far .
it foresees providing $ 2.9 billion in consumer rebates for solar panels and installing 3,000 megawatts of solar electricity on the rooftops of one million homes , businesses and public buildings by 2017 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar ship , was built in germany within days of the announcement , the shares of german solar companies such as q-cells , conergy , ersol and solarworld shot up by an average 1.5 percent .
they also bagged the first four spots in the tec-dax technology share index in which almost half of all businesses are focused on the solar energy sector . a little bit of california sunshine and , that is n't the end of the story .
german companies , who have already established themselves as leaders in the solar energy industry , are hopeful that the new developments in california will have a positive ripple effect . " the program in california will secure the growth of the industry , " hartmuth schüning , head of the supervisory board at q-cells told berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week .
" for q-cells , the us will , in the long term , be the most important market after germany . " the view is echoed by frank asbeck , head of bonn-based solarworld , who said that his company had already received plum contracts from california totalling two-digit million figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar power station near munich germany is already one of the largest european markets for solar power , with state financing helping to support the sector by making roof-top solar panels affordable for households via subsidies . investor interest in solar energy has also been soaring after oil prices rose to record highs , increasing the attractiveness of renewable energy . foreign potential and challenges but most experts see foreign markets providing the most crucial potential for growth . the federal association of solar economy -lrb- bsw -rrb- estimates that german solar companies will register a 3-billion euro turnover abroad by 2010 . solarworld reckons that by the end of 2007 , its share of revenue in foreign markets will rise to 60 percent from the current 40 . in addition to the united states , greece , italy , portugal , spain , south korea and a few provinces in china are also investing in solar energy . spain , whose solar energy sector has increased threefold in the past year , and italy , where experts expect tenfold growth in the industry in 2006 , remain crucial markets for german solar companies . but german firms face challenges when it comes to sustaining their edge in the industry . asian companies , such as sharp , kyocera and sanyo , which discovered the power of the sun in tapping energy long before german firms , pose tough competition .
and even giant us multinationals such as bp , shell and general electric are investing massive sums in solar energy . a further problem hindering the growth of the photovoltaic industry is the lack of silica , a basic raw material needed in generating solar energy .
experts estimate that silica producers would need until 2007 to fulfill growing demand . rosy future in the long run , experts foresee a rosy future for the industry . " in the short term , the current share rises might seem a bit exaggerated , " patrick hummel , an analyst at the landesbank baden-württemberg told der tagesspiegel . " but the overall prospects for the sector are fantastic , " he said , adding that more countries needed to follow california 's example . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's solar explosion q-cells ag , a maker of solar cells , became the latest alternative energy company to make its debut on the german stock exchange on wednesday , with its shares showing warm gains on their first day of trading .

" this is international anti-semitism at work , " said gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in an interview with german magazine der spiegel .
his parliamentary colleague , left party member norman paech , added that the conference was part of an on-going " strategy of provocation " being employed by the iranian government . werner hoyer from the free-market liberal free democratic party told der spiegel that the idea of the conference was " untenable " and that such a meeting of holocaust skeptics at a time of heightened tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions was a " dangerous spark in the powder keg . " ahmadi n ejad spreadi n g a n ti-semitic doctri n e , claims gree n chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer warned a conference would further isolate iran .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer said that the planned conference was further evidence that president mahmoud ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran .
president ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " and has questioned the right of israel to exist . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . "
everybody which gets involved in anti-semitism or racism soils its own culture and nation , he added .
" this also applies to iran . " weisskirchen meanwhile cautioned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously .
he added that ahmadinejad was trying to validate his stance on denial by inviting well-known authorities on the subject . " ahmadinejad apparently now tries to give a quasi-scientific meaning to his rhetoric , " weisskirchen said . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .
holocaust denial is a criminal offence in germany . irvi n g a n d others would be free to speak i n ira n with impu n ity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if freed from austria , irving would be able to speak in iran without restriction .
british historian david irving is currently awaiting trial in austria on charges of holocaust denial and faces a possible sentence of between one to 10 years in prison if found guilty . irving , whose trial begins on feb .
20 , was arrested in the southern province of styria in november under a warrant issued in 1989 .
irving held two speeches in austria that year , during which he allegedly claimed there had been no gas chambers at auschwitz . however , gerry gable , the former editor of anti-fascist magazine searchlight and an authority on irving told dw-world that if irving escapes prosecution in austria , he and his fellow speakers will be free to travel to the middle east to speak with impunity . " iran obviously has no law against holocaust denial and therefore if irving or anyone else speaks there they will not be punished , " gable said .

" this is international anti-semitism at work , " said gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in an interview with german magazine der spiegel .
his parliamentary colleague , left party member norman paech , added that the conference was part of an on-going " strategy of provocation " being employed by the iranian government . werner hoyer from the free-market liberal free democratic party told der spiegel that the idea of the conference was " untenable " and that such a meeting of holocaust skeptics at a time of heightened tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions was a " dangerous spark in the powder keg . " ahmadi n ejad spreadi n g a n ti-semitic doctri n e , claims gree n chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer warned a conference would further isolate iran .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer said that the planned conference was further evidence that president mahmoud ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran .
president ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " and has questioned the right of israel to exist . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . "
everybody which gets involved in anti-semitism or racism soils its own culture and nation , he added .
" this also applies to iran . " weisskirchen meanwhile cautioned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously .
he added that ahmadinejad was trying to validate his stance on denial by inviting well-known authorities on the subject . " ahmadinejad apparently now tries to give a quasi-scientific meaning to his rhetoric , " weisskirchen said . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .

many of them voiced their anger and frustration on the streets of berlin , while smaller protest actions took place in other big cities across the country .
tens of thousands of practices were shut nationwide . andreas schulz , a general practitioner in lower saxony and one of the protesters in berlin , hoped that wednesday 's protest would have an impact on germany 's politicians . " we definitely think that with our action today and following action we are able to change the existing conditions .
the leading politicians , including our new chancellor merkel , will have to listen to the doctors , because otherwise the patient care will go down in germany . " the restricted funding policy pursued by statutory health funds and endorsed by the government does not only mean less money for the treatment of patients but also less money in doctors ' pockets at the end of the day .
doctors are forced to observe ceilings on what they spend on their patients or face financial penalties themselves . " the amount of money the health insurance funds give to the doctors is very strictly budgeted , " explained hans-jörg freese , a spokesman for the german medical association . health insurance funds decide fees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors say they have been inadequately paid for a decade " we have a different system when you compare it with other countries like britain , where you have a state financed system .
in germany we have health insurance funds , and they have to decide and negotiate with the doctors the amount of money they give for the healthcare system .
and we have had low wages over the last 10 years in germany . " health minister ulla schmidt has shown little sympathy for the doctors .
she has said that doctors have less to complain about than they would have us believe .
she does n't subscribe to the view that doctors are paid too little , insisting that their incomes are above the average earnings of german academics . politicians have no grip on realistic figures , say doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors and nurses are blowing the whistle on their pay conditions but andreas schulz said the minister did n't know what she was talking about .
" the politicians do not understand hospital funding , and they definitely do n't understand funding of the practices outside the hospital , " the doctor said .
" they mention numbers that are valid about the turnover of funding inside and outside the hospitals , but the important thing is what is left for the individual doctor , for the individual practice , after everything has been paid . " the protesters are warning that more and more german doctors will leave the country , if conditions in the health system remain unchanged .
they point out that a third of all doctor 's practices are currently facing bankruptcy and that the number is even higher in rural areas . in many cases , nurses can no longer be employed full-time and the purchase of essential new equipment is postponed to avoid financial disaster . hardy graupner -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin doctors demand better wages medical workers at europe 's largest university hospital started a week-long strike in berlin on monday , with more strikes being planned for december all over germany .

" it was a conference of commitment and pledging that really showed solidarity , " the un 's coordinator on avian and human influenza , david nabarro , told reporters at the end of the conference .
" we 've got a fantastic set of pledges from poor countries as well as rich countries .
even countries that can not put money into the funding are saying we are going to commit our people and our governments to get the results . " the european commissioner for health and consumer safety , markos kyprianou , said nearly $ 1 billion had been pledged in grants , which would go mainly to low-income countries in southeast asia and africa .
the other $ 900 million would come in loans , he said .

within the eu , $ 138 million will come directly from the 25 member states while the european commission will deliver another $ 121 million .
japan committed $ 159 million to the global fight , while russia pledged $ 44.9 million and australia committed itself to $ 41.7 million .

with the virus spreading from asia to the middle east and now to europe in the past year , the world fears bird flu could become a pandemic that could kill millions . un secretary general kofi annan told the conference via video link that the world was not prepared for a pandemic and called for major efforts in stepping up preparations .

the plan aims to keep bird flu from moving from its current form , which is mainly transmitted from poultry to humans , to one that is transmissible among humans . most of the money will be spent on launching public awareness programs , strengthening outbreak detection and response , disinfection , slaughter and vaccination of poultry , and compensation for farmers .

will his visit be overshadowed by reports that german secret agents aided the us in the war on iraq ? steinmeier 's first visit to the region was n't meant to be much more than a get-to-know-you session with the key players in the region .
now , it wo n't even be that .
the foreign minister was forced to cut the planned four-day trip in half , meaning that instead of stopping in israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , he will only visit egypt on wednesday and thursday . the reason for the change in plans is also the reason why the trip has been attracting the scrutiny of the german press - a potential intelligence scandal involving german secret agents in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investigating reports that bnd agents aided the us in iraq reports began surfacing last week that german bnd foreign intelligence agents may have helped american forces select bombing targets during the 2003 invasion of iraq .
both steinmeier and former defense minister peter struck have denied the reports , which would go against germany 's claims that it took no active part in the war . a parliamentary debate on the bnd 's role during the iraq war will be held on friday , and a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry said that steinmeier intends to take part .
steinmeier will return from egypt to attend the debate . there was speculation that the intelligence affair would have overshadowed steinmeier 's trip , although udo steinbach , head of the hamburg-based german orient institute told dw-world that the issue has n't been ruffling feathers in the arab world . " as long as the facts are n't clear , i do n't think that the arab world would have any great interest in the affair , " said steinbach .
" the perception of germany in the arab world , in iraq , is not going to change . " israeli submarines a bigger hurdle steinbach said that the bigger hurdle for steinmeier was the fact that the previous government , in one of its last acts , had promised to sell two submarines to israel at a discounted price . " this has attracted much more attention , " steinbach said .
" this is one point that could probably be brought up with the foreign minister in egypt .
missiles with a far range , possibly even nuclear warheads , can be mounted on these submarines , and this could create difficulties for germany when it comes to its role as the honest broker . " steinbach said that while it 's not possible for the current government to step back from the promise , steinmeier can explain germany 's interests in the deal .

will his visit be overshadowed by reports that german secret agents aided the us in the war on iraq ? steinmeier 's first visit to the region was n't meant to be much more than a get-to-know-you session with the key players in the region .
now , it wo n't even be that .
the foreign minister was forced to cut the planned four-day trip in half , meaning that instead of stopping in israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , he will only visit egypt on wednesday and thursday . the reason for the change in plans is also the reason why the trip has been attracting the scrutiny of the german press - a potential intelligence scandal involving german secret agents in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investigating reports that bnd agents aided the us in iraq reports began surfacing last week that german bnd foreign intelligence agents may have helped american forces select bombing targets during the 2003 invasion of iraq .
both steinmeier and former defense minister peter struck have denied the reports , which would go against germany 's claims that it took no active part in the war . a parliamentary debate on the bnd 's role during the iraq war will be held on friday , and a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry said that steinmeier intends to take part .
steinmeier will return from egypt to attend the debate . there was speculation that the intelligence affair would have overshadowed steinmeier 's trip , although udo steinbach , head of the hamburg-based german orient institute told dw-world that the issue has n't been ruffling feathers in the arab world . " as long as the facts are n't clear , i do n't think that the arab world would have any great interest in the affair , " said steinbach .
" the perception of germany in the arab world , in iraq , is not going to change . " israeli submarines a bigger hurdle steinbach said that the bigger hurdle for steinmeier was the fact that the previous government , in one of its last acts , had promised to sell two submarines to israel at a discounted price . " this has attracted much more attention , " steinbach said .
" this is one point that could probably be brought up with the foreign minister in egypt .
missiles with a far range , possibly even nuclear warheads , can be mounted on these submarines , and this could create difficulties for germany when it comes to its role as the honest broker . " steinbach said that while it 's not possible for the current government to step back from the promise , steinmeier can explain germany 's interests in the deal .

german opposition parties have called for a formal parliamentary probe into the country 's foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- affair .
but what can the bnd divulge and what rights does the inquiry committee even have ? allegations that the german foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- shared intelligence with the united states during the iraq war cast doubt on former chancellor gerhard schröder 's highly popular opposition to the invasion . the explosive topic raises the question , though , as to what extent bnd employees are even allowed to testify before the committee .
and , do they have to ? at the same time , it 's questionable whether a parliamentary inquiry into this issue is even necessary .
after all , the parliamentary control board pkg already holds a controlling function over the various intelligence services . the rights a n d respo n sibilities of a n i n quiry committee an inquiry committee is a parliamentary information and control board .
its main task is reviewing alleged abuses in the government and administration or political misconduct . according to the constitution , it can be called up if one-quarter of the bundestag are in favor of one .
with the current parliamentary distribution , the three opposition factions have the possibility to call for such an inquiry committee to clear up the bnd-iraq affair .
the committee 's makeup is determined according to the factions ' respective sizes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier know ?
should an inquiry committee be called , it has the right to meet in closed sessions .
legally , witnesses are obligated to appear before the committee if summoned to do so .
this is also the case for bnd staff - in principle .
even if no criminal measures can be taken due to the committee 's conclusions , it is legally possible to order a compulsory showing of witnesses . however , this obligation does not apply to the bnd .
the intelligence service can retain witnesses under reference to national security interests , said bärbel schubert , press officer for the bundestag .
it is legally unclear what subsequently happens in such cases .
it is certain , though , that the inquiry committee can only deliberate on the justification for the witness withholding , but can not object to the bnd 's decision . bnd a n d co n trol boards n eed each other ultimately , the bnd decides what could endanger national security , not the parliamentary committee .
even if bnd employees would testify , the bundestag would not have to be informed of all the details . attorney alexander hirsch , author of the book " the control of the intelligence services , " said that , on the one hand , the bnd 's secrecy was justified .
on the other hand , the parliament had the right to be informed .
hirsch said that both the control boards and the bnd needed each other and that an interdependency between the two existed . hirsch said that the bnd would soon have a problem with public acceptance if it did not allow itself to be controlled and just sparked negative headlines .
that is why the bnd was dependent on control . " if the bnd forbid its staff from testifying , this would also have informative value , even if it would n't satisfy the opposition , " said hirsch .
the bnd should therefore consider its actions carefully , he said . usi n g i n quiries for political aims the parliamentary committee is considered to be the strongest weapon of the opposition .
that the opposition is demanding both a transparent parliamentary control board , even though it is subject to secrecy , as well as calling for an inquiry committee certainly has other reasons . hirsch said that the inquiry committee had deviated from its actual purpose and is used by the opposition for campaign objectives . already in 1995 , bnd actions led to a parliamentary inquiry .
at the time , it was leaked that the successful arrest of a columbian plutonium dealer at the munich airport in august 1994 had been staged .
the bnd , the bavarian criminal police office and the bavarian judiciary system were all involved . the arrest was aimed to demonstrate a politically useful manhunt in the run-up to bavarian and federal elections .
at the time , the bnd police informer rafael ferreras fernandez surprisingly testified before the so-called plutonium inquiry committee . lenz hörburger -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence affair forces steinmeier to shorten middle east trip german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has embarked on his first trip to the middle east .

" i am in favor of a general liberalization of markets and port services , but i can not support this proposal , " said liberal josu ortuondo larrea . deputies from all political parties in the european parliament had lined up earlier in the week to denounce the plans as threatening dock workers ' jobs by opening up ports to more competition , including from companies outside the european union . " i believe this text belongs in the dockside rubbish container , and i hope that is where it will end up after we reject it , " said socialist willi piecyk on tuesday .
" i have n't heard a single argument which justifies endangering these jobs , " he added . rejected pla n had bee n ame n ded from last vetoed draft bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's back to the drawing board for barrot 's port proposals .
eu transport commissioner jacques barrot , defending his plans , said he would " draw the necessary conclusions " from the vote .
he said amendments suggested by the parliament at an earlier stage had already been included . " the improvements brought by parliament were excellent , and allowed us to respond to some justified criticisms of the text , " he said . the rejected plan was the second attempt by the european commission , after eu lawmakers rejected a first version in november 2003 . europe 's dock workers fear the liberalization plans , which seek to let more firms compete for work , could cost thousands of jobs in a sector that handles the vast majority of europe 's exports . one point that had drawn particular ire from the dockers is a proposal for so-called " self handling , " meaning that crew on vessels could load and unload their own cargo , taking work away from europe 's relatively costly dock workers . dockers make feeli n gs clear through strikes a n d viole n ce in a day of strikes monday , tens of thousands of dockers from copenhagen to lisbon and antwerp to piraeus walked off the job to protest against the proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angry dock workers laid siege to the european parliament in strasbourg .
on the same day thousands of dockers demonstrated in strasbourg , clashing with police outside the eu assembly in a confrontation that left 64 officers hurt and caused hundreds of thousands of euros ' worth of damage to the building itself , according to police authorities . officials said at least 200 square meters -lrb- 2,150 square feet -rrb- of windows were smashed when demonstrators hurled rocks and bottles at the parliament building . police fired tear gas grenades in a bid to curb the unrest , said authorities , who put the number of demonstrators at 6,200 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 18.01.2006 putin 's parting gift gives merkel paws for thought großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after arriving back in berlin , putin 's gift was put straight to work outside the bundestag politics is a dog-eat-dog business where it pays to read between the lines .
so when russia 's president putin presented angela merkel with a stuffed toy puppy monday , her surprise may have been tempered with suspicion . angela merkel could be excused for scratching her head all the way back to berlin on her flight home from moscow after meeting with russian president vladimir putin this week . not only did putin give very mixed signals as to what , if any , support he would give merkel and the other eu leaders in the iranian nuclear stand-off , he also presented her with a strange parting gift . politicians and leaders are notorious for lavishing items such as rolex watches , jewelry , even expensive vacations on each other as way of a " thank you " for a state visit .
the extravagance of the present is often perceived as an indication as to the respect and admiration one has for the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you ai n't nothing like a hound dog : putin puts on the charm .
so one can only wonder where the german chancellor stands in putin 's esteem after being handed a small black and white toy dog that would not look out of place on the prize shelf at a fairground shooting gallery .
-lrb- in case you were wondering , yes , we fooled you with the picture above - the german sheperd had to do as a stand-in as merkel 's present is being kept under wraps . -rrb- while the two are unlikely to get as close as putin and merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , it is also unlikely that the stuffed animal is a reflection of the president 's opinion of the germany 's latest leader .
however , could it have been a coded political message ? a coded message of puti n 's hopes for the future ? maybe it meant that he expects frau merkel to follow obediently behind as he continues to ignore international pressure regarding russia 's human rights record .
or that the chancellor will be required to bare her teeth and growl at detractors in the eu who dare to mention russia 's continued involvement in chechnya .
or maybe he sees the pair of them just sitting cozily by the fire together in his black sea retreat . sadly the real reason behind the gift is likely to be less cryptic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't worry , angie .
it 's stuffed . "
according to german tabloid bild , the chancellor was bitten by a dog at a very young age and has been afraid of them ever since .
the paper suggests that president putin 's plush pooch has a gentler role to play in merkel 's life , helping her to get over her fear of canines . it could also be a sign that putin 's bark is worse than his bite .
could this be the start of some puppy love ? dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mean mama pooh-poohs pooches animal protection zealots would be the first to warn want-to-please parents not to buy pets for their youngsters ' stockings .

will his visit be overshadowed by reports that german secret agents aided the us in the war on iraq ? steinmeier 's first visit to the region was n't meant to be much more than a get-to-know-you session with the key players in the region .
now , it wo n't even be that .
the foreign minister was forced to cut the planned four-day trip in half , meaning that instead of stopping in israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , he will only visit egypt on wednesday and thursday . the reason for the change in plans is also the reason why the trip has been attracting the scrutiny of the german press - a potential intelligence scandal involving german secret agents in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investigating reports that bnd agents aided the us in iraq reports began surfacing last week that german bnd foreign intelligence agents may have helped american forces select bombing targets during the 2003 invasion of iraq .
both steinmeier and former defense minister peter struck have denied the reports , which would go against germany 's claims that it took no active part in the war . a parliamentary debate on the bnd 's role during the iraq war will be held on friday , and a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry said that steinmeier intends to take part .
steinmeier will return from egypt to attend the debate . there was speculation that the intelligence affair would have overshadowed steinmeier 's trip , although udo steinbach , head of the hamburg-based german orient institute told dw-world that the issue has n't been ruffling feathers in the arab world . " as long as the facts are n't clear , i do n't think that the arab world would have any great interest in the affair , " said steinbach .
" the perception of germany in the arab world , in iraq , is not going to change . " israeli submarines a bigger hurdle steinbach said that the bigger hurdle for steinmeier was the fact that the previous government , in one of its last acts , had promised to sell two submarines to israel at a discounted price . " this has attracted much more attention , " steinbach said .
" this is one point that could probably be brought up with the foreign minister in egypt .
missiles with a far range , possibly even nuclear warheads , can be mounted on these submarines , and this could create difficulties for germany when it comes to its role as the honest broker . " steinbach said that while it 's not possible for the current government to step back from the promise , steinmeier can explain germany 's interests in the deal . " if he is asked about it , he could do damage control , " steinbach said . steinmeier 's first appointment in cairo is with his egyptian counterpart , ahmed abul gheit .
a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak is planned for the following day . while in egypt , steinmeier will also attend the opening of the cairo international book fair , at which germany is a guest of honor .
the event should " reassure the arab world of the significance germany attaches to cultural exchanges with the arab world , " said steinmeier 's spokesman , martin jäger . merkel to visit israel steinmeier now has to wait to make his first visit to israel - a country that his predecessor joschka fischer visited 15 times during his tenure as foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke out in support of israel during her recent visit to washington but israel wo n't have to wait long to make its first formal acquaintance with the new german government .
chancellor angela merkel is expected to visit israel in late january to reaffirm germany 's solidarity with the jewish state , especially in light of anti-israeli remarks made by iran 's president in recent months , calling for israel to be " wiped off the map " and referring to the holocaust as a myth . merkel has already made her support of israel clear .

will his visit be overshadowed by reports that german secret agents aided the us in the war on iraq ? steinmeier 's first visit to the region was n't meant to be much more than a get-to-know-you session with the key players in the region .
now , it wo n't even be that .
the foreign minister was forced to cut the planned four-day trip in half , meaning that instead of stopping in israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , he will only visit egypt on wednesday and thursday . the reason for the change in plans is also the reason why the trip has been attracting the scrutiny of the german press - a potential intelligence scandal involving german secret agents in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investigating reports that bnd agents aided the us in iraq reports began surfacing last week that german bnd foreign intelligence agents may have helped american forces select bombing targets during the 2003 invasion of iraq .
both steinmeier and former defense minister peter struck have denied the reports , which would go against germany 's claims that it took no active part in the war . a parliamentary debate on the bnd 's role during the iraq war will be held on friday , and a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry said that steinmeier intends to take part .
steinmeier will return from egypt to attend the debate . there was speculation that the intelligence affair would have overshadowed steinmeier 's trip , although udo steinbach , head of the hamburg-based german orient institute told dw-world that the issue has n't been ruffling feathers in the arab world . " as long as the facts are n't clear , i do n't think that the arab world would have any great interest in the affair , " said steinbach .
" the perception of germany in the arab world , in iraq , is not going to change . " israeli submarines a bigger hurdle steinbach said that the bigger hurdle for steinmeier was the fact that the previous government , in one of its last acts , had promised to sell two submarines to israel at a discounted price . " this has attracted much more attention , " steinbach said .
" this is one point that could probably be brought up with the foreign minister in egypt .
missiles with a far range , possibly even nuclear warheads , can be mounted on these submarines , and this could create difficulties for germany when it comes to its role as the honest broker . " steinbach said that while it 's not possible for the current government to step back from the promise , steinmeier can explain germany 's interests in the deal . " if he is asked about it , he could do damage control , " steinbach said . steinmeier 's first appointment in cairo is with his egyptian counterpart , ahmed abul gheit .
a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak is planned for the following day . while in egypt , steinmeier will also attend the opening of the cairo international book fair , at which germany is a guest of honor .
the event should " reassure the arab world of the significance germany attaches to cultural exchanges with the arab world , " said steinmeier 's spokesman , martin jäger . merkel to visit israel steinmeier now has to wait to make his first visit to israel - a country that his predecessor joschka fischer visited 15 times during his tenure as foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke out in support of israel during her recent visit to washington but israel wo n't have to wait long to make its first formal acquaintance with the new german government .

the intelligence service can retain witnesses under reference to national security interests , said bärbel schubert , press officer for the bundestag .

german opposition parties have called for a formal parliamentary probe into the country 's foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- affair .
but what can the bnd divulge and what rights does the inquiry committee even have ? allegations that the german foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- shared intelligence with the united states during the iraq war cast doubt on former chancellor gerhard schröder 's highly popular opposition to the invasion . the explosive topic raises the question , though , as to what extent bnd employees are even allowed to testify before the committee .
and , do they have to ? at the same time , it 's questionable whether a parliamentary inquiry into this issue is even necessary .
after all , the parliamentary control board pkg already holds a controlling function over the various intelligence services . the rights a n d respo n sibilities of a n i n quiry committee an inquiry committee is a parliamentary information and control board .
its main task is reviewing alleged abuses in the government and administration or political misconduct . according to the constitution , it can be called up if one-quarter of the bundestag are in favor of one .
with the current parliamentary distribution , the three opposition factions have the possibility to call for such an inquiry committee to clear up the bnd-iraq affair .
the committee 's makeup is determined according to the factions ' respective sizes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier know ?
should an inquiry committee be called , it has the right to meet in closed sessions .
legally , witnesses are obligated to appear before the committee if summoned to do so .
this is also the case for bnd staff - in principle .
even if no criminal measures can be taken due to the committee 's conclusions , it is legally possible to order a compulsory showing of witnesses . however , this obligation does not apply to the bnd .
the intelligence service can retain witnesses under reference to national security interests , said bärbel schubert , press officer for the bundestag .
it is legally unclear what subsequently happens in such cases .
it is certain , though , that the inquiry committee can only deliberate on the justification for the witness withholding , but can not object to the bnd 's decision . bnd a n d co n trol boards n eed each other ultimately , the bnd decides what could endanger national security , not the parliamentary committee .
even if bnd employees would testify , the bundestag would not have to be informed of all the details . attorney alexander hirsch , author of the book " the control of the intelligence services , " said that , on the one hand , the bnd 's secrecy was justified .
on the other hand , the parliament had the right to be informed .
hirsch said that both the control boards and the bnd needed each other and that an interdependency between the two existed . hirsch said that the bnd would soon have a problem with public acceptance if it did not allow itself to be controlled and just sparked negative headlines .
that is why the bnd was dependent on control . " if the bnd forbid its staff from testifying , this would also have informative value , even if it would n't satisfy the opposition , " said hirsch .
the bnd should therefore consider its actions carefully , he said . usi n g i n quiries for political aims the parliamentary committee is considered to be the strongest weapon of the opposition .
that the opposition is demanding both a transparent parliamentary control board , even though it is subject to secrecy , as well as calling for an inquiry committee certainly has other reasons . hirsch said that the inquiry committee had deviated from its actual purpose and is used by the opposition for campaign objectives . already in 1995 , bnd actions led to a parliamentary inquiry .
at the time , it was leaked that the successful arrest of a columbian plutonium dealer at the munich airport in august 1994 had been staged .
the bnd , the bavarian criminal police office and the bavarian judiciary system were all involved . the arrest was aimed to demonstrate a politically useful manhunt in the run-up to bavarian and federal elections .
at the time , the bnd police informer rafael ferreras fernandez surprisingly testified before the so-called plutonium inquiry committee . lenz hörburger -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence affair forces steinmeier to shorten middle east trip german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has embarked on his first trip to the middle east .

" this is international anti-semitism at work , " said gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in an interview with german magazine der spiegel .
his parliamentary colleague , left party member norman paech , added that the conference was part of an on-going " strategy of provocation " being employed by the iranian government . werner hoyer from the free-market liberal free democratic party told der spiegel that the idea of the conference was " untenable " and that such a meeting of holocaust skeptics at a time of heightened tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions was a " dangerous spark in the powder keg .

green party chief reinhard bütikofer said that the planned conference was further evidence that president mahmoud ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran .
president ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " and has questioned the right of israel to exist . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . "
everybody which gets involved in anti-semitism or racism soils its own culture and nation , he added .
" this also applies to iran . " weisskirchen meanwhile cautioned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously .
he added that ahmadinejad was trying to validate his stance on denial by inviting well-known authorities on the subject . " ahmadinejad apparently now tries to give a quasi-scientific meaning to his rhetoric , " weisskirchen said . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .

irving held two speeches in austria that year , during which he allegedly claimed there had been no gas chambers at auschwitz . however , gerry gable , the former editor of anti-fascist magazine searchlight and an authority on irving told dw-world that if irving escapes prosecution in austria , he and his fellow speakers will be free to travel to the middle east to speak with impunity .

" this is international anti-semitism at work , " said gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in an interview with german magazine der spiegel .
his parliamentary colleague , left party member norman paech , added that the conference was part of an on-going " strategy of provocation " being employed by the iranian government . werner hoyer from the free-market liberal free democratic party told der spiegel that the idea of the conference was " untenable " and that such a meeting of holocaust skeptics at a time of heightened tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions was a " dangerous spark in the powder keg . " ahmadi n ejad spreadi n g a n ti-semitic doctri n e , claims gree n chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer warned a conference would further isolate iran .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer said that the planned conference was further evidence that president mahmoud ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran .
president ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " and has questioned the right of israel to exist . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . "
everybody which gets involved in anti-semitism or racism soils its own culture and nation , he added .
" this also applies to iran . " weisskirchen meanwhile cautioned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously .
he added that ahmadinejad was trying to validate his stance on denial by inviting well-known authorities on the subject . " ahmadinejad apparently now tries to give a quasi-scientific meaning to his rhetoric , " weisskirchen said . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .

british historian david irving is currently awaiting trial in austria on charges of holocaust denial and faces a possible sentence of between one to 10 years in prison if found guilty . irving , whose trial begins on feb .
20 , was arrested in the southern province of styria in november under a warrant issued in 1989 .
irving held two speeches in austria that year , during which he allegedly claimed there had been no gas chambers at auschwitz . however , gerry gable , the former editor of anti-fascist magazine searchlight and an authority on irving told dw-world that if irving escapes prosecution in austria , he and his fellow speakers will be free to travel to the middle east to speak with impunity . " iran obviously has no law against holocaust denial and therefore if irving or anyone else speaks there they will not be punished , " gable said .

" i believe this text belongs in the dockside rubbish container , and i hope that is where it will end up after we reject it , " said socialist willi piecyk on tuesday .

will his visit be overshadowed by reports that german secret agents aided the us in the war on iraq ? steinmeier 's first visit to the region was n't meant to be much more than a get-to-know-you session with the key players in the region .
now , it wo n't even be that .
the foreign minister was forced to cut the planned four-day trip in half , meaning that instead of stopping in israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , he will only visit egypt on wednesday and thursday . the reason for the change in plans is also the reason why the trip has been attracting the scrutiny of the german press - a potential intelligence scandal involving german secret agents in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is investigating reports that bnd agents aided the us in iraq reports began surfacing last week that german bnd foreign intelligence agents may have helped american forces select bombing targets during the 2003 invasion of iraq .
both steinmeier and former defense minister peter struck have denied the reports , which would go against germany 's claims that it took no active part in the war . a parliamentary debate on the bnd 's role during the iraq war will be held on friday , and a spokeswoman from the german foreign ministry said that steinmeier intends to take part .
steinmeier will return from egypt to attend the debate . there was speculation that the intelligence affair would have overshadowed steinmeier 's trip , although udo steinbach , head of the hamburg-based german orient institute told dw-world that the issue has n't been ruffling feathers in the arab world .

" this has attracted much more attention , " steinbach said .
" this is one point that could probably be brought up with the foreign minister in egypt .
missiles with a far range , possibly even nuclear warheads , can be mounted on these submarines , and this could create difficulties for germany when it comes to its role as the honest broker . " steinbach said that while it 's not possible for the current government to step back from the promise , steinmeier can explain germany 's interests in the deal . " if he is asked about it , he could do damage control , " steinbach said . steinmeier 's first appointment in cairo is with his egyptian counterpart , ahmed abul gheit .
a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak is planned for the following day . while in egypt , steinmeier will also attend the opening of the cairo international book fair , at which germany is a guest of honor .
the event should " reassure the arab world of the significance germany attaches to cultural exchanges with the arab world , " said steinmeier 's spokesman , martin jäger . merkel to visit israel steinmeier now has to wait to make his first visit to israel - a country that his predecessor joschka fischer visited 15 times during his tenure as foreign minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke out in support of israel during her recent visit to washington but israel wo n't have to wait long to make its first formal acquaintance with the new german government .

" we 've got a fantastic set of pledges from poor countries as well as rich countries .
even countries that can not put money into the funding are saying we are going to commit our people and our governments to get the results . " the european commissioner for health and consumer safety , markos kyprianou , said nearly $ 1 billion had been pledged in grants , which would go mainly to low-income countries in southeast asia and africa .

the plan aims to keep bird flu from moving from its current form , which is mainly transmitted from poultry to humans , to one that is transmissible among humans . most of the money will be spent on launching public awareness programs , strengthening outbreak detection and response , disinfection , slaughter and vaccination of poultry , and compensation for farmers .

" it was a conference of commitment and pledging that really showed solidarity , " the un 's coordinator on avian and human influenza , david nabarro , told reporters at the end of the conference .
" we 've got a fantastic set of pledges from poor countries as well as rich countries .
even countries that can not put money into the funding are saying we are going to commit our people and our governments to get the results . " the european commissioner for health and consumer safety , markos kyprianou , said nearly $ 1 billion had been pledged in grants , which would go mainly to low-income countries in southeast asia and africa .
the other $ 900 million would come in loans , he said .
us do n ates most the united states was the biggest donor , pledging $ 334 million , followed by the european union , which said it would offer $ 260 million .
within the eu , $ 138 million will come directly from the 25 member states while the european commission will deliver another $ 121 million .
japan committed $ 159 million to the global fight , while russia pledged $ 44.9 million and australia committed itself to $ 41.7 million .
china , which co-hosted the event along with the world bank and the european commission , pledged $ 10 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world is unprepared for a bird flu pandemic , un chief annan said the higher-than-expected pledges came after the conference was told repeatedly of the immense dangers for the world posed by the bird flu virus , which has killed around 80 people since re-emerging in 2003 .
with the virus spreading from asia to the middle east and now to europe in the past year , the world fears bird flu could become a pandemic that could kill millions . un secretary general kofi annan told the conference via video link that the world was not prepared for a pandemic and called for major efforts in stepping up preparations . " there 's no time to waste , " annan said .
" let 's ensure we 're ready .
we are not yet there .
to be truly prepared we would need to mount a tremendous effort . "
all cou n tries face threat with the disease killing four people in turkey this month , the first deaths outside southeast asia and china , the conference heard that the virus was capable of spreading easily across borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the money pledged will go to slaughtering and vaccinated poultry " all countries can be affected if a pandemic occurs , " world bank president paul wolfowitz said in a televised speech .
" all countries share responsibilities to fight the spread of the disease and to put human and financial resources behind the effort . " officials said the next step was to assess funding proposals from the needy countries and set up a system to ensure the money is well spent to implement a three-year action plan laid out at the first donors ' conference in geneva in november .
the plan aims to keep bird flu from moving from its current form , which is mainly transmitted from poultry to humans , to one that is transmissible among humans . most of the money will be spent on launching public awareness programs , strengthening outbreak detection and response , disinfection , slaughter and vaccination of poultry , and compensation for farmers .
money will also be used to stockpile drugs to treat bird flu victims and to prepare a currently non-existent vaccine . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the continuing threat read recent dw-world stories from the front line and the efforts of those attempting to stop the deadly h5n1 virus .

" this is international anti-semitism at work , " said gert weisskirchen , the foreign affairs spokesman for the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in an interview with german magazine der spiegel .
his parliamentary colleague , left party member norman paech , added that the conference was part of an on-going " strategy of provocation " being employed by the iranian government . werner hoyer from the free-market liberal free democratic party told der spiegel that the idea of the conference was " untenable " and that such a meeting of holocaust skeptics at a time of heightened tensions over iran 's nuclear ambitions was a " dangerous spark in the powder keg . " ahmadi n ejad spreadi n g a n ti-semitic doctri n e , claims gree n chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard bütikofer warned a conference would further isolate iran .
green party chief reinhard bütikofer said that the planned conference was further evidence that president mahmoud ahmadinejad was pursuing an " unrestrained policy of anti-semitic indoctrination " in iran .
president ahmadinejad has called the holocaust a " myth " and has questioned the right of israel to exist . bütikofer said ahmadinejad had used public statements questioning the legitimacy of the holocaust to mobilize iranian fundamentalists .
this will lead , he said , to " the international isolation of the iranian regime . "
everybody which gets involved in anti-semitism or racism soils its own culture and nation , he added .
" this also applies to iran . " weisskirchen meanwhile cautioned western leaders not to be sucked into a further row with iran as the so-called " holocaust experts " could not be taken seriously .
he added that ahmadinejad was trying to validate his stance on denial by inviting well-known authorities on the subject . " ahmadinejad apparently now tries to give a quasi-scientific meaning to his rhetoric , " weisskirchen said . as well as condemning the conference , german politicians were quick to point out that any germans who spoke at the conference would have to accept the legal consequences .

irving held two speeches in austria that year , during which he allegedly claimed there had been no gas chambers at auschwitz . however , gerry gable , the former editor of anti-fascist magazine searchlight and an authority on irving told dw-world that if irving escapes prosecution in austria , he and his fellow speakers will be free to travel to the middle east to speak with impunity . " iran obviously has no law against holocaust denial and therefore if irving or anyone else speaks there they will not be punished , " gable said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2006 german doctors protest against pay conditions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the system is sick " claims this and many more german doctors over 20,000 doctors from hospitals and private practices all over germany took to the streets wednesday to protest against poor salaries and bureaucracy in the statutory health system . most german doctors are no longer willing to accept what they refer to as the adverse funding conditions in the statutory health system .
many of them voiced their anger and frustration on the streets of berlin , while smaller protest actions took place in other big cities across the country .
tens of thousands of practices were shut nationwide . andreas schulz , a general practitioner in lower saxony and one of the protesters in berlin , hoped that wednesday 's protest would have an impact on germany 's politicians . " we definitely think that with our action today and following action we are able to change the existing conditions .
the leading politicians , including our new chancellor merkel , will have to listen to the doctors , because otherwise the patient care will go down in germany . " the restricted funding policy pursued by statutory health funds and endorsed by the government does not only mean less money for the treatment of patients but also less money in doctors ' pockets at the end of the day .
doctors are forced to observe ceilings on what they spend on their patients or face financial penalties themselves . " the amount of money the health insurance funds give to the doctors is very strictly budgeted , " explained hans-jörg freese , a spokesman for the german medical association . health insurance funds decide fees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors say they have been inadequately paid for a decade " we have a different system when you compare it with other countries like britain , where you have a state financed system .
in germany we have health insurance funds , and they have to decide and negotiate with the doctors the amount of money they give for the healthcare system .
and we have had low wages over the last 10 years in germany . " health minister ulla schmidt has shown little sympathy for the doctors .
she has said that doctors have less to complain about than they would have us believe .
she does n't subscribe to the view that doctors are paid too little , insisting that their incomes are above the average earnings of german academics . politicians have no grip on realistic figures , say doctors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors and nurses are blowing the whistle on their pay conditions but andreas schulz said the minister did n't know what she was talking about .
" the politicians do not understand hospital funding , and they definitely do n't understand funding of the practices outside the hospital , " the doctor said .

german opposition parties have called for a formal parliamentary probe into the country 's foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- affair .
but what can the bnd divulge and what rights does the inquiry committee even have ? allegations that the german foreign intelligence services -lrb- bnd -rrb- shared intelligence with the united states during the iraq war cast doubt on former chancellor gerhard schröder 's highly popular opposition to the invasion . the explosive topic raises the question , though , as to what extent bnd employees are even allowed to testify before the committee .
and , do they have to ? at the same time , it 's questionable whether a parliamentary inquiry into this issue is even necessary .
after all , the parliamentary control board pkg already holds a controlling function over the various intelligence services . the rights a n d respo n sibilities of a n i n quiry committee an inquiry committee is a parliamentary information and control board .
its main task is reviewing alleged abuses in the government and administration or political misconduct . according to the constitution , it can be called up if one-quarter of the bundestag are in favor of one .
with the current parliamentary distribution , the three opposition factions have the possibility to call for such an inquiry committee to clear up the bnd-iraq affair .
the committee 's makeup is determined according to the factions ' respective sizes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much does foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier know ?
should an inquiry committee be called , it has the right to meet in closed sessions .
legally , witnesses are obligated to appear before the committee if summoned to do so .
this is also the case for bnd staff - in principle .
even if no criminal measures can be taken due to the committee 's conclusions , it is legally possible to order a compulsory showing of witnesses . however , this obligation does not apply to the bnd .
the intelligence service can retain witnesses under reference to national security interests , said bärbel schubert , press officer for the bundestag .
it is legally unclear what subsequently happens in such cases .
it is certain , though , that the inquiry committee can only deliberate on the justification for the witness withholding , but can not object to the bnd 's decision . bnd a n d co n trol boards n eed each other ultimately , the bnd decides what could endanger national security , not the parliamentary committee .
even if bnd employees would testify , the bundestag would not have to be informed of all the details . attorney alexander hirsch , author of the book " the control of the intelligence services , " said that , on the one hand , the bnd 's secrecy was justified .
on the other hand , the parliament had the right to be informed .
hirsch said that both the control boards and the bnd needed each other and that an interdependency between the two existed . hirsch said that the bnd would soon have a problem with public acceptance if it did not allow itself to be controlled and just sparked negative headlines .
that is why the bnd was dependent on control . " if the bnd forbid its staff from testifying , this would also have informative value , even if it would n't satisfy the opposition , " said hirsch .
the bnd should therefore consider its actions carefully , he said . usi n g i n quiries for political aims the parliamentary committee is considered to be the strongest weapon of the opposition .
that the opposition is demanding both a transparent parliamentary control board , even though it is subject to secrecy , as well as calling for an inquiry committee certainly has other reasons . hirsch said that the inquiry committee had deviated from its actual purpose and is used by the opposition for campaign objectives . already in 1995 , bnd actions led to a parliamentary inquiry .
at the time , it was leaked that the successful arrest of a columbian plutonium dealer at the munich airport in august 1994 had been staged .
the bnd , the bavarian criminal police office and the bavarian judiciary system were all involved . the arrest was aimed to demonstrate a politically useful manhunt in the run-up to bavarian and federal elections .
at the time , the bnd police informer rafael ferreras fernandez surprisingly testified before the so-called plutonium inquiry committee . lenz hörburger -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de intelligence affair forces steinmeier to shorten middle east trip german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has embarked on his first trip to the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 18.01.2006 putin 's parting gift gives merkel paws for thought großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after arriving back in berlin , putin 's gift was put straight to work outside the bundestag politics is a dog-eat-dog business where it pays to read between the lines .
so when russia 's president putin presented angela merkel with a stuffed toy puppy monday , her surprise may have been tempered with suspicion . angela merkel could be excused for scratching her head all the way back to berlin on her flight home from moscow after meeting with russian president vladimir putin this week . not only did putin give very mixed signals as to what , if any , support he would give merkel and the other eu leaders in the iranian nuclear stand-off , he also presented her with a strange parting gift . politicians and leaders are notorious for lavishing items such as rolex watches , jewelry , even expensive vacations on each other as way of a " thank you " for a state visit .
the extravagance of the present is often perceived as an indication as to the respect and admiration one has for the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you ai n't nothing like a hound dog : putin puts on the charm .
so one can only wonder where the german chancellor stands in putin 's esteem after being handed a small black and white toy dog that would not look out of place on the prize shelf at a fairground shooting gallery .
-lrb- in case you were wondering , yes , we fooled you with the picture above - the german sheperd had to do as a stand-in as merkel 's present is being kept under wraps . -rrb- while the two are unlikely to get as close as putin and merkel 's predecessor gerhard schröder , it is also unlikely that the stuffed animal is a reflection of the president 's opinion of the germany 's latest leader .
however , could it have been a coded political message ? a coded message of puti n 's hopes for the future ? maybe it meant that he expects frau merkel to follow obediently behind as he continues to ignore international pressure regarding russia 's human rights record .
or that the chancellor will be required to bare her teeth and growl at detractors in the eu who dare to mention russia 's continued involvement in chechnya .
or maybe he sees the pair of them just sitting cozily by the fire together in his black sea retreat . sadly the real reason behind the gift is likely to be less cryptic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do n't worry , angie .
it 's stuffed . "
according to german tabloid bild , the chancellor was bitten by a dog at a very young age and has been afraid of them ever since .
the paper suggests that president putin 's plush pooch has a gentler role to play in merkel 's life , helping her to get over her fear of canines . it could also be a sign that putin 's bark is worse than his bite .
could this be the start of some puppy love ? dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mean mama pooh-poohs pooches animal protection zealots would be the first to warn want-to-please parents not to buy pets for their youngsters ' stockings .

alex tew , 21 , hit the headlines at the start of the year when he revealed his million dollar homepage had made him a million dollars in four months .
but the publicity brought the unwanted attention of extortionists who knocked the site over with a massive denial-of-service attack .
following a week of downtime , the website is now back online .
police alerted mr tew 's encounter with the net criminals began on 7 january when he received an e-mail threatening to bombard the site with data unless he paid a ransom of $ 5,000 -lrb- £ 2,800 -rrb- . "
i have n't replied to any of them as i do n't want to give them the satisfaction and i certainly do n't intend to pay them any money " alex tew he did not respond and the 10 january deadline passed without incident .
but the following day the site went down , and has only been up intermittently since then .
a series of other e-mails , upping the ransom to $ 50,000 -lrb- £ 28,000 -rrb- , followed .
" i have n't replied to any of them as i do n't want to give them the satisfaction and i certainly do n't intend to pay them any money , " mr tew told the bbc news website .
both the fbi and the hi-tech crime unit of the wiltshire constabulary have been notified about the problem .
" their instinct is that this attack originates in russia although it is not possible to track the e-mail back to its source , " said mr tew .
" there is not much more that they can do , " he added .
instead , mr tew 's web hosting firm sitelutions worked to solve the problem , initially coming up with a hardware solution .
it did not work because of the size of the attack .
currently traffic to mr tew 's website is being filtered via a us-based firm ddosprotection.com - experts in dealing with such attacks - and that solution appears to be working .
the site is back online , albeit a little slow for visitors .
preventing denial-of-service attacks can be a costly business but , ever the entrepreneur , mr tew is hopeful he can do a deal with his new partner - offering them free ad space in return for them keeping his site up and running .
zombie pcs it has become common practice for extortionists to target net firms and threaten to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless they pay a ransom .
ddos attack explained ddos = distributed denial of service attack malicious hacker uses virus to hijack numerous computers on command these zombie computers flood the targeted website with useless data the target 's internet servers are overwhelmed by junk data customers have trouble using the targeted website targeted website can be slow or inaccessible for days fighting dos attacks is laborious and costly because the zombies are distributed across the internet , finding the attacker is difficult so-called distributed denial-of-service -lrb- ddos -rrb- attacks overwhelm servers with customer requests until they are forced offline .
computers are innocently recruited from all over the world to take part in the attack , each sending only a small part of the entire data flood .
the recruiting of machines to take part in attacks is typically done by infecting them with a virus or worm .
the net address of compromised machines - dubbed zombies or bots - is sent back to the criminal , who will use it to launch a ddos .

since it began - with the slogan back to sleep - 1991 , the number of cot deaths has fallen by 75 % in britain , saving an estimated 14,000 babies ' lives .
most people now follow the advice to put babies to sleep on their backs , rather than their tummies at the bottom of the cot .
but , according to experts , a new danger has emerged .
there has been a huge increase in the number of babies who die when their parents doze off with them on the sofa .
about 30 babies died in this way over the past year - and now it 's led to a new campaign to make sure parents are aware of the dangers .
this morning on breakfast we talked to joyce epstein , of the foundation for the study of sudden infant death - and to mum caroline wheeler , who lost one of her twins to cot death .
you can also find the latest guidance on how to avoid cot deaths on this story .
caroline described how she discovered that her baby son thomas had died : " my twins were born as a result of ivf .
thomas was the bigger of the two and was also a very hungry feeder .
" i had fed both of them ; i put joseph back in the cot , but thomas wanted more .
" we both fell asleep and when i woke up two hours later - because joseph woke up - thomas felt very still .
" when i checked him , he did n't look right .
he 'd died in the bed . "
how to reduce cot death risk cut smoking during pregnancy - fathers too do not expose your child to smoke put your baby to sleep on its back , feet to foot of the cot keep your baby cool , with its head uncovered .
do n't use duvets or cot bumpers do n't share a bed with your baby if you 're very tired , smoke or have been drinking sleep in the same room as your baby for the first six months never fall asleep with a baby on a sofa or armchair if your baby is unwell , seek medical advice promptly q & a : cot death to this day , caroline does n't know exactly why thomas died .
she does know from the postmortem that he did n't suffocate and she always followed safety advice about not letting your baby overheat .
after his death , she told us , she has always chosen the most uncomortable chair to feed her babies in , so she 'd never fall asleep again .
according to cot death campaigner , joyce epstein , sleeping with your baby in bed is far less dangerous than dozing off on the sofa .
" bring the baby into bed for feeds and cuddles , but put the baby back in his cot to go to sleep , " she said .
a team from bristol royal children 's hospital , which has been studying sudden infant deaths , is warning that cot deaths do n't always happen in a cot .
they have discovered that around 30 babies each year die when they 're sharing a sofa or armchair with a parent who dozes off .
a further 135 babies died last year when they were sharing a bed with their parents .
the study also found more deaths are occurring among poor families , and among those where the mother the researchers are worried that some mothers may have misunderstood the advice not to take the baby into bed .
they believe mums may be getting up to feed babies on the sofa , then falling asleep because they 're so tired .
prof peter fleming told breakfast : " it 's actually far more dangerous -lrb- to fall asleep on the sofa -rrb- than having the baby in bed in the first place . "
it is already known that the risk of sudden infant death syndrome -lrb- sids -rrb- is higher for babies that are born premature , or have a low birthweight .
male babies also appear to be more at risk , as do those who sleep on their side or front .
smoking during pregnancy , or in the house after a child is born , is another risk factor .

she does know from the postmortem that he did n't suffocate and she always followed safety advice about not letting your baby overheat .
after his death , she told us , she has always chosen the most uncomortable chair to feed her babies in , so she 'd never fall asleep again .
according to cot death campaigner , joyce epstein , sleeping with your baby in bed is far less dangerous than dozing off on the sofa .
" bring the baby into bed for feeds and cuddles , but put the baby back in his cot to go to sleep , " she said. watch our interview in full with caroline and joyce a team from bristol royal children 's hospital , which has been studying sudden infant deaths , is warning that cot deaths do n't always happen in a cot .
they have discovered that around 30 babies each year die when they 're sharing a sofa or armchair with a parent who dozes off .
a further 135 babies died last year when they were sharing a bed with their parents .
the study also found more deaths are occurring among poor families , and among those where the mother the researchers are worried that some mothers may have misunderstood the advice not to take the baby into bed .
they believe mums may be getting up to feed babies on the sofa , then falling asleep because they 're so tired .
prof peter fleming told breakfast : " it 's actually far more dangerous -lrb- to fall asleep on the sofa -rrb- than having the baby in bed in the first place . "
it is already known that the risk of sudden infant death syndrome -lrb- sids -rrb- is higher for babies that are born premature , or have a low birthweight .
male babies also appear to be more at risk , as do those who sleep on their side or front .
smoking during pregnancy , or in the house after a child is born , is another risk factor .

raising public awareness the primary aim of all the road safety campaigns that we run is to raise public awareness to a problem and hopefully educate the road using public by offering advice in relation to that problem .
you may well be aware that we have regularly and successfully run such campaigns aimed at drink and drug driving , the wearing of seatbelts , speeding , the use of mobile phones and vehicle safety .
the success of all of our campaigns relies on the assistance of the media in highlighting the campaign in newspapers and on radio and television .
having seen no decrease in the number of pedal cyclist casualties over the last few years it was felt prudent to highlight this problem by our usual means .
the aim of the campaign was therefore to highlight the measures that cyclists can take in order to reduce the risks to themselves ; including the wearing of a helmet and bright clothing and the use of lights in darkness or poor visibility .
allied to this we wished to highlight the fact that cyclists are subject to road traffic law in much the same way as motorists .
again by obeying the law cyclists will reduce the risk of being involved in an accident .
the timing of the campaign coincided with the start of the new academic year and the reduction in daylight hours with the onset of autumn .
as was pointed out in the numerous media releases , all road users have a part to play in road safety and it is acknowledged that driver behaviour is responsible for the majority of accidents on our roads .
there are numerous reasons for crashes involving pedal cyclists , one of the most common factors being error or illegality on the part of motorists .
driver behaviour as a police service , and in particular in the traffic branch , we deal with errant motorists 365 days of the year and they are the usual targets of our education and enforcement campaigns .
please be assured that a great deal of effort is being put in , by myself and my colleagues in the traffic branch , to changing driver behaviour and prosecuting bad driving when the circumstances merit such action .
as the number of road users continues to rise we are all competing for a limited amount of road space and measures such as the red cycle lanes and boxes have been put in place to try and separate vehicles from pedal cycles . "
we must attract millions to get a bike and get some training and get out there " malcolm wardlaw " everyone is finding bad news " however , there is anecdotal evidence that a minority of pedal cyclists are putting their safety at risk by disobeying some of the basic rules of the road ; this includes riding through red traffic lights .
it is interesting to note that some of the pedal cycling public who were interviewed by the media on the first day of the campaign were quite vigorous in highlighting the number of fellow cyclists they see breaking the law .
therefore , as enforcement has an important part to play in promoting road safety it is only prudent that we are seen to be taking action against offenders .
the aim of the campaign was not to persecute cyclists but to raise public awareness of the problem through our usual methods .
the media interest at the start of the campaign was very encouraging and there was good coverage on television , radio and in the newspapers .
from this point of view the campaign has been a success , igniting debate on the issues raised .

raising public awareness the primary aim of all the road safety campaigns that we run is to raise public awareness to a problem and hopefully educate the road using public by offering advice in relation to that problem .
you may well be aware that we have regularly and successfully run such campaigns aimed at drink and drug driving , the wearing of seatbelts , speeding , the use of mobile phones and vehicle safety .
the success of all of our campaigns relies on the assistance of the media in highlighting the campaign in newspapers and on radio and television .
mr buchanan says everyone has a role to play in road safety having seen no decrease in the number of pedal cyclist casualties over the last few years it was felt prudent to highlight this problem by our usual means .
the aim of the campaign was therefore to highlight the measures that cyclists can take in order to reduce the risks to themselves ; including the wearing of a helmet and bright clothing and the use of lights in darkness or poor visibility .
allied to this we wished to highlight the fact that cyclists are subject to road traffic law in much the same way as motorists .
again by obeying the law cyclists will reduce the risk of being involved in an accident .
the timing of the campaign coincided with the start of the new academic year and the reduction in daylight hours with the onset of autumn .
as was pointed out in the numerous media releases , all road users have a part to play in road safety and it is acknowledged that driver behaviour is responsible for the majority of accidents on our roads .

dredging took place over christmas and the new year to deepen the harbour and its approaches .
sand will now be pumped onto beaches at bournemouth , swanage and poole as part of a replenishing programme .
daily work to spray a third of the sand on bournemouth beach is due to start on wednesday and will last until february .
the area between each groyne on the beach will be closed in turn to allow the work to take place .
wreck found a bournemouth borough council spokesperson said : " initially the beach material will look darker than that of the current beach but will gradually lighten to a normal colour with exposure to oxygen and daylight .
" within a few weeks , the action of the wind and waves will mix the material to look more like the existing beach . "
once the material has dried the area will be reopened .
the spokesperson added that during dredging work , a wreck was found and there was a chance that material of archaeological importance could be pumped onto the beaches .
councillor john hayter said : " beach replenishment takes place from time to time as beach material is lost as part of the natural erosion of the shore .
" we are working with neighbouring authorities of poole and purbeck in undertaking these major works to improve the standard of defence against storms , which will in turn protect the surrounding areas . "

our visit to trincomalee was a tale of two journeys .
we were prevented from entering the port because our arrival coincided with a suspected tamil tiger grenade attack on a police checkpoint , which prompted the security forces to seal off the road .
our departure was complicated by a virtual blockade of the city by the janatha vimukthi peramuna -lrb- jvp -rrb- , the extreme nationalist party , whose half-drunk supporters had surrounded our vehicle earlier that day and threatened to beat us up .
on the way in , we witnessed the ruthlessness of the rebels , who have come now to express themselves almost exclusively through violence and appear to be measuring their success in the blood of members of the security forces .
on the way out , we saw the brute force of sinalese nationalism .
the attack on the police checkpoint was viewed by the security forces as almost routine - one of over 1,000 violations of the 2002 ceasefire agreement by the tamil tigers , the colombo government alleges .
the suspected rebels waited until dark before hurling two grenades .
one exploded metres short of the checkpoint , injuring a policeman .
another landed on the sandbag-protected bunker , but failed to detonate .
then the checkpoint came under a hail of gunfire , a trademark of rebel attacks .
' undeclared war ' we arrived a few minutes later , just after the army had launched their search for the suspected rebels .
two military motorbikes flashed by with gun-toting soldiers perched precariously on the back .
in an area dense with palm trees and undergrowth , and cloaked by now in almost complete darkness , their chances of success did not look good .
sure enough , they failed to flush out the attackers .
when we finally reached our hotel , the music in the lobby was a panpipe version of the simon and garfunkel classic bridge over troubled water .
only five days before , the sea tigers had launched a suicide bomb attack on a sri lankan navy patrol boat nearby in which 13 sailors were killed .
it seemed a particularly unfortunate choice .
trincomalee , where tamils , sinhalese and muslims are almost evenly split but the government is in control , is fast becoming a key battlefield in what feels more and more like an undeclared civil war .
twenty-four hours after we arrived , the jvp started to enforce its three-day strike , which was called partly in protest at the recent upsurge in rebel violence .
' mob rule ' early that thursday morning , we had set off from our hotel to meet up with the sri lankan army , who had promised to allow us to film one of their patrols .
but our way was soon blocked by a group of jvp strikers , who took great offence at our attempts to film the empty streets and barricaded shops .
as our vehicle was brought to an abrupt halt , we were quickly encircled .
some of the strikers covered their faces with scarves , one of them gripping a hacksaw in his right hand .
others started making calls on their mobile phones to summon reinforcements .
one of the more thick-set protesters reached through the driver 's window and seized control of the keys .
others threatened to harm our cameraman unless he handed over the tape - something which we refused to do .
instead , we reluctantly agreed to erase a short portion of film - deleting enough to satisfy the strikers ' drunken self-appointed censor , but retaining enough to give viewers a brief sense of the mob 's violent intent .
the shots we did n't manage to capture were of the policeman standing in front of the vehicle and soldiers standing close by .
throughout the stand-off , they did nothing to intervene .
that day in trincomalee the mob was in the chair .
growing lawlessness a few hours later , a major in the sri lankan army told us he could no longer guarantee our safety .
there had been more jvp threats .
two hours later , we left .
the ceasefire agreement may not yet have broken down but there is an alarming level of lawlessness and unrestrained violence in the disputed north-east .
in trincomalee alone , the tigers are attacking at will .
jvp hardliners can issue threats with impunity .
and the sri lankan military stands accused of the extra-judicial killing earlier this month of five young tamil students , whom ceasefire monitors agree were shot through the head in execution-style killings .
by stepping up attacks , the tamil tigers clearly hope to provoke the government into a bloody retaliation so that the country 's new president , mahinda rajapakse , will be blamed for the breakdown of the ceasefire .
right now , the president says he remains committed to the truce .
there 's little doubt that we will make further journeys to sri lanka over the coming months for the crisis seems almost certain to escalate .
and there 's little doubt those visits will be punctuated by violence and civil strife .
the government and the tigers fully understand the dreadful consequences of a return to civil war .
but this is a country with a blood-soaked history , where reason has all too often given way to rage .

our visit to trincomalee was a tale of two journeys .
we were prevented from entering the port because our arrival coincided with a suspected tamil tiger grenade attack on a police checkpoint , which prompted the security forces to seal off the road .
our departure was complicated by a virtual blockade of the city by the janatha vimukthi peramuna -lrb- jvp -rrb- , the extreme nationalist party , whose half-drunk supporters had surrounded our vehicle earlier that day and threatened to beat us up .
on the way in , we witnessed the ruthlessness of the rebels , who have come now to express themselves almost exclusively through violence and appear to be measuring their success in the blood of members of the security forces .
on the way out , we saw the brute force of sinalese nationalism .
the attack on the police checkpoint was viewed by the security forces as almost routine - one of over 1,000 violations of the 2002 ceasefire agreement by the tamil tigers , the colombo government alleges .
the suspected rebels waited until dark before hurling two grenades .
one exploded metres short of the checkpoint , injuring a policeman .
another landed on the sandbag-protected bunker , but failed to detonate .
then the checkpoint came under a hail of gunfire , a trademark of rebel attacks .
' undeclared war ' we arrived a few minutes later , just after the army had launched their search for the suspected rebels .
two military motorbikes flashed by with gun-toting soldiers perched precariously on the back .
in an area dense with palm trees and undergrowth , and cloaked by now in almost complete darkness , their chances of success did not look good .
sure enough , they failed to flush out the attackers .
when we finally reached our hotel , the music in the lobby was a panpipe version of the simon and garfunkel classic bridge over troubled water .
only five days before , the sea tigers had launched a suicide bomb attack on a sri lankan navy patrol boat nearby in which 13 sailors were killed .

trincomalee , where tamils , sinhalese and muslims are almost evenly split but the government is in control , is fast becoming a key battlefield in what feels more and more like an undeclared civil war .
twenty-four hours after we arrived , the jvp started to enforce its three-day strike , which was called partly in protest at the recent upsurge in rebel violence .
' mob rule ' early that thursday morning , we had set off from our hotel to meet up with the sri lankan army , who had promised to allow us to film one of their patrols .
the sea tigers are said to be well-armed and ruthless but our way was soon blocked by a group of jvp strikers , who took great offence at our attempts to film the empty streets and barricaded shops .
as our vehicle was brought to an abrupt halt , we were quickly encircled .
some of the strikers covered their faces with scarves , one of them gripping a hacksaw in his right hand .
others started making calls on their mobile phones to summon reinforcements .
one of the more thick-set protesters reached through the driver 's window and seized control of the keys .
others threatened to harm our cameraman unless he handed over the tape - something which we refused to do .
instead , we reluctantly agreed to erase a short portion of film - deleting enough to satisfy the strikers ' drunken self-appointed censor , but retaining enough to give viewers a brief sense of the mob 's violent intent .
the shots we did n't manage to capture were of the policeman standing in front of the vehicle and soldiers standing close by .
throughout the stand-off , they did nothing to intervene .
that day in trincomalee the mob was in the chair .

our visit to trincomalee was a tale of two journeys .
we were prevented from entering the port because our arrival coincided with a suspected tamil tiger grenade attack on a police checkpoint , which prompted the security forces to seal off the road .
our departure was complicated by a virtual blockade of the city by the janatha vimukthi peramuna -lrb- jvp -rrb- , the extreme nationalist party , whose half-drunk supporters had surrounded our vehicle earlier that day and threatened to beat us up .
on the way in , we witnessed the ruthlessness of the rebels , who have come now to express themselves almost exclusively through violence and appear to be measuring their success in the blood of members of the security forces .
on the way out , we saw the brute force of sinalese nationalism .
the attack on the police checkpoint was viewed by the security forces as almost routine - one of over 1,000 violations of the 2002 ceasefire agreement by the tamil tigers , the colombo government alleges .
the suspected rebels waited until dark before hurling two grenades .
one exploded metres short of the checkpoint , injuring a policeman .
another landed on the sandbag-protected bunker , but failed to detonate .
then the checkpoint came under a hail of gunfire , a trademark of rebel attacks .
' undeclared war ' we arrived a few minutes later , just after the army had launched their search for the suspected rebels .
two military motorbikes flashed by with gun-toting soldiers perched precariously on the back .
in an area dense with palm trees and undergrowth , and cloaked by now in almost complete darkness , their chances of success did not look good .
sure enough , they failed to flush out the attackers .
when we finally reached our hotel , the music in the lobby was a panpipe version of the simon and garfunkel classic bridge over troubled water .
only five days before , the sea tigers had launched a suicide bomb attack on a sri lankan navy patrol boat nearby in which 13 sailors were killed .
it seemed a particularly unfortunate choice .
trincomalee , where tamils , sinhalese and muslims are almost evenly split but the government is in control , is fast becoming a key battlefield in what feels more and more like an undeclared civil war .
twenty-four hours after we arrived , the jvp started to enforce its three-day strike , which was called partly in protest at the recent upsurge in rebel violence .
' mob rule ' early that thursday morning , we had set off from our hotel to meet up with the sri lankan army , who had promised to allow us to film one of their patrols .
the sea tigers are said to be well-armed and ruthless but our way was soon blocked by a group of jvp strikers , who took great offence at our attempts to film the empty streets and barricaded shops .
as our vehicle was brought to an abrupt halt , we were quickly encircled .
some of the strikers covered their faces with scarves , one of them gripping a hacksaw in his right hand .
others started making calls on their mobile phones to summon reinforcements .
one of the more thick-set protesters reached through the driver 's window and seized control of the keys .
others threatened to harm our cameraman unless he handed over the tape - something which we refused to do .
instead , we reluctantly agreed to erase a short portion of film - deleting enough to satisfy the strikers ' drunken self-appointed censor , but retaining enough to give viewers a brief sense of the mob 's violent intent .
the shots we did n't manage to capture were of the policeman standing in front of the vehicle and soldiers standing close by .
throughout the stand-off , they did nothing to intervene .
that day in trincomalee the mob was in the chair .
growing lawlessness a few hours later , a major in the sri lankan army told us he could no longer guarantee our safety .
there had been more jvp threats .
two hours later , we left .
rajihar manoharan 's parents allege he was executed by military forces the ceasefire agreement may not yet have broken down but there is an alarming level of lawlessness and unrestrained violence in the disputed north-east .
in trincomalee alone , the tigers are attacking at will .
jvp hardliners can issue threats with impunity .
and the sri lankan military stands accused of the extra-judicial killing earlier this month of five young tamil students , whom ceasefire monitors agree were shot through the head in execution-style killings .
by stepping up attacks , the tamil tigers clearly hope to provoke the government into a bloody retaliation so that the country 's new president , mahinda rajapakse , will be blamed for the breakdown of the ceasefire .
right now , the president says he remains committed to the truce .
there 's little doubt that we will make further journeys to sri lanka over the coming months for the crisis seems almost certain to escalate .
and there 's little doubt those visits will be punctuated by violence and civil strife .
the government and the tigers fully understand the dreadful consequences of a return to civil war .
but this is a country with a blood-soaked history , where reason has all too often given way to rage .

the 30-year-old musician told the bbc 's six o 'clock news : " no way was it in my head to capture a film that glorifies violence . "
he added that jarhead , a film depicting the gulf war , was " far more violent than the 50 cent experience " .
the movie 's uk premiere took place on tuesday in london 's leicester square .
it opens on 20 january .
a film poster for the story of 50 cent 's life fell foul of advertising watchdogs earlier this month for " glamorising " gun crime .
the rap star , who first hit the charts three years ago , said that his music had put him under added scrutiny when the film - his debut - came out , which charts his difficult formative years in the tough new york district of queens .
' protest every time ' " because of my music and lyrics i 've been under different standards to begin with because the content is aggressive .
creatively i 'm put in a box because of perceptions of me , " he said .
50 cent , best known for his hits in da club and candy shop , added that the poster promoting his film was not the first to depict weaponry .
it was recently criticised for " glamorising " gun crime by the uk advertising standards authority .
record label universal music said the image was meant to communicate 50 cent 's fight to escape the ghetto .
" creatively i have n't done anything that was n't acceptable , " the rapper said .
" eighteen films that came out before mine utilised weapons on their artwork .
but when mine comes out they start protesting .
" if it glamorises it when i do it , then it 's glamorised period .
so we should protest every time , " said the performer , who added that he is no longer living the tough life of the ghetto .
' inspiring ' 50 cent , who plays the lead role in get rich or die tryin ' , said that making a film was " the biggest and best " way to tell a story - even more so than music .
he also said that the film shows a softer side to his character which has not been revealed through his music .
" i show more vulnerability in this film than i do in my music .
people forget that i 'm human and forget how much time it took to create it .
" people are attracted to me because of my experience .
my story in itself is inspiring and shows that they can be successful .
i 'm drawn to capturing what i 've experienced , " he added .
