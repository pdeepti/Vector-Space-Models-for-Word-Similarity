after the match , they 're all going to need a place to sleep that leaves enough euros in their pocket for a celebratory dinner . the average price for accommodation during the world cup is 190 euros -lrb- $ 241 -rrb- per night - including everything from a youth hostel dorm room to a multi-star hotel suite , according to the fifa world cup accommodation services .
that 's a price some fans ca n't afford , according to ergin iyilikci , spokesperson for immobilienscout24 , an online real estate agent that has set up a special web site for people looking to rooms during the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even they will tire out eventually " the average hotel rates can make for a pricey night , " he said , explaining why young people and families are especially interested in internet sites where they have a chance to stay in the homes of other soccer fans at more affordable rates or free of charge . even for those willing to pay hotel prices , it is likely that there will not be enough rooms available , according nikola günther , who runs another site connecting tired world cup fans with empty beds . dema n d expected to i n crease i n may a n d ju n e " as soon as the decision was made that the world cup would take place in germany , we realized the number of hotel beds would not be enough , " günther said , adding that the site 's average price is between 20 euros and 40 euros per night . the more than 15,000 housing ads , including everything from a spare couch in the living room , to entire apartments and even a multi-room villa , currently outstrip demand , but that 's expected to change as the cup approaches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spare sofa is all some soccer fans are looking for the lists of accommodation are free to people looking for a place to stay , some , however , charge potential hosts as a way of filtering jokers registering their neighbor 's house from serious offers .
hosts are given free reign in determining how much to charge guests . " we 're convinced supply and demand will keep the prices under control , " iyilikci said .
" people who want 500 euros a night wo n't find anyone interested in their place . " rooms cheaper , more perso n al i n host 's home many of the people offering to put up a stranded soccer fan or two , like munich 's gerhard schubert , are n't asking for any payment at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many desperate soccer fans could squeeze into the typical living room ?
" i would much rather stay somewhere more personal than a hotel when i travel and thought i could give the same chance to someone else , " said the 43-year-old soccer fan , who is offering to pull out the sofa-bed in his guest room free of charge .
" i know how expensive munich can be . " andreas schlüter , 27 , said he and his roommate thought offering their hamburg apartment 's extra room to soccer fans was a great idea . " the world cup is called ' a time to make friends , ' and i think that should be brought to life , " he said , adding that he is n't worried about sharing his apartment with hooligans .
" i think only open people with good intentions take part in things like this . " just over half of germans are willing to take the world cup motto to heart by housing fans , according to a study commissioned by immobilenscout24 . fa n s make good city guides for other fa n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans enjoy each other 's company - especially after the game the types of personal exchanges that take place when fans from different countries also show that fans can be friends and rivals at the same time , according to marc bialojahn of ei n dach für fa n s -lrb- a roof for friends -rrb- . " for 90 minutes a healthy rivalry dominates everything - that 's good because that 's what makes soccer great , " he said .
" then you can talk reasonably to each other and go out and have a beer together . " an advantage of staying with a fellow fan instead of in generic hotel room is that soccer fans tend to know where the city 's best bars , restaurants and places to watch the game are , bialojahn added . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a woman 's place is in the stadium soccer games have always been a predominantly male bastion in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education tuition fees face uphill battle in germany study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch private universities take hold in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative germany -pipe- 08.05.2006 german schools : creating social division or reflecting it ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say germany 's educational system is far from egalitarian chancellor merkel wants to hold a high-level integration summit after last month 's crisis at a berlin school whose pupils are mainly from immigrant families .
who 's to blame ?
the parents or the school system ?
or both ? politicians of all stripes agree on one thing : the equally gifted child from a working class immigrant background should have the same chance to enter university as the son of a dentist .
since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration issues are n't the only problems german schools have " the educational system is not the cause of problems , but reflects society as a whole .
in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with learning difficulties may not get the support they need in school " there are so many pupils from families who offer no support whatsoever .
so many parents could n't care less , " said barbara brüse , a primary school teacher in bonn who has spent decades teaching immigrant children . parents can even be counterproductive when faced with a bright child .
only 36 percent of migrant children who have the smarts to attend gymnasium do so , according to heinz-peter meidinger .
" there is resistance to sending girls in particular , because the attitude is : what does she need an education for ? " is a good education so unimportant to migrant families ?
" our educational system should have the ambition to change those values , " concluded andreas schleicher . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government planning integration summit in an attempt to develop a new integration concept , the german government will organize a summit to address a wide range of issues surrounding immigrants and their families .

who 's to blame ?
the parents or the school system ?
or both ? politicians of all stripes agree on one thing : the equally gifted child from a working class immigrant background should have the same chance to enter university as the son of a dentist .
since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration issues are n't the only problems german schools have " the educational system is not the cause of problems , but reflects society as a whole .
in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with learning difficulties may not get the support they need in school " there are so many pupils from families who offer no support whatsoever .
so many parents could n't care less , " said barbara brüse , a primary school teacher in bonn who has spent decades teaching immigrant children . parents can even be counterproductive when faced with a bright child .
only 36 percent of migrant children who have the smarts to attend gymnasium do so , according to heinz-peter meidinger .
" there is resistance to sending girls in particular , because the attitude is : what does she need an education for ? " is a good education so unimportant to migrant families ?

who 's to blame ?
the parents or the school system ?
or both ? politicians of all stripes agree on one thing : the equally gifted child from a working class immigrant background should have the same chance to enter university as the son of a dentist .
since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration issues are n't the only problems german schools have " the educational system is not the cause of problems , but reflects society as a whole .
in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with learning difficulties may not get the support they need in school " there are so many pupils from families who offer no support whatsoever .
so many parents could n't care less , " said barbara brüse , a primary school teacher in bonn who has spent decades teaching immigrant children . parents can even be counterproductive when faced with a bright child .
only 36 percent of migrant children who have the smarts to attend gymnasium do so , according to heinz-peter meidinger .

the parents or the school system ?
or both ? politicians of all stripes agree on one thing : the equally gifted child from a working class immigrant background should have the same chance to enter university as the son of a dentist .
since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration issues are n't the only problems german schools have " the educational system is not the cause of problems , but reflects society as a whole .
in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with learning difficulties may not get the support they need in school " there are so many pupils from families who offer no support whatsoever .
so many parents could n't care less , " said barbara brüse , a primary school teacher in bonn who has spent decades teaching immigrant children . parents can even be counterproductive when faced with a bright child .
only 36 percent of migrant children who have the smarts to attend gymnasium do so , according to heinz-peter meidinger .
" there is resistance to sending girls in particular , because the attitude is : what does she need an education for ? " is a good education so unimportant to migrant families ?
" our educational system should have the ambition to change those values , " concluded andreas schleicher . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government planning integration summit in an attempt to develop a new integration concept , the german government will organize a summit to address a wide range of issues surrounding immigrants and their families .

after the match , they 're all going to need a place to sleep that leaves enough euros in their pocket for a celebratory dinner . the average price for accommodation during the world cup is 190 euros -lrb- $ 241 -rrb- per night - including everything from a youth hostel dorm room to a multi-star hotel suite , according to the fifa world cup accommodation services .

" it is great to wrap up the title with a week to go , " said bayern munich coach felix magath .
" to defend the double is unique and the team has been exceptional .
we can all be very proud of our achievement and there will be some celebrations tonight for sure . " magath arrived from vfb stuttgart in july 2004 and has lifted back-to-back doubles in his first two seasons . " full credit to felix -lrb- magath -rrb- .
he has won two league and cup doubles in a row .
that is mightily impressive , " said general manager uli hoeness . bayern were far from convincing against lowly kaiserslautern but captain oliver kahn saluted his team for winning a sixth title in eight seasons .
" kaiserslautern made it difficult but we have a lot of experience in title battles and used it , " said the german international goalkeeper . " we have dominated the league this season and deserve to win the title .
you need to come up with the big points at the right time and we did that . " closest rivals gracious in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas ottl squeezes in the title-winning goal sv hamburg were bayern 's main challengers this season but their manager thomas doll admitted the best team had won .

" i offer my compliments to bayern .
they were incredibly consistent all season and that is the difference , " said schaaf . former bayern star mario basler congratulated his ex-club - where he won three bundesliga titles - but admitted he was hoping for some stronger competition in the future .
" well done to bayern but to be honest it is getting a bit boring now , " basler said . bayern have won 20 domestic titles with fc nuremberg the next best on nine although their last triumph came way back in 1968 . bayern oils the revolving door for summer sales for bayern to win their 21st title next season , there will have to be a change of personnel as a number of senior players - most notably the chelsea-bound michael ballack - are considering ending their association with the record-breaking bundesliga champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even physical restraint is unlikely to stop podolski leaving while speculation is rife about those who will be on their way out , one who seems destined to be on his way in is fc cologne striker lukas podolski . the 20-year-old international forward is regarded as one of germany 's best young players and since his current club are due to be relegated at the end of this season , it seems most likely that he will continue his career in the top flight by joining the powerful bavarians for the next campaign .

according to hoeness , a deal with podolski 's agent for the player was " as good as agreed " although bayern have yet to speak to cologne . prince poldi and van buyten targeted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buyten could be saying his farewells to hamburg another addition could be rivals sv hamburg 's inspirational captain daniel van buyten .
" he has let it be known that he wants to come to us , " hoeness said of the 28-year-old belgian centre-back .
" now he has to discuss it with hamburg . " but whoever comes in at the allianz arena , it will be very hard to fill the void left by the expected departure of ballack , germany 's one true world star .
ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .

however , his anticipated loss to the english champions will expose bayern 's shortcomings both on and off the pitch where richer and potentially more successful clubs can swoop for their players in the same way as bayern feed of their rivals in the domestic transfer market . off the pitch , even if podolski and van buyten come , the bavarians will still need to find someone who can play such an effective all-round game in midfield and bring that star quality to the team . hoeness believes that man will be julio dos santos , the 22-year-old paraguay midfielder who joined bayern in january but who has yet to make his bundesliga debut .
" he 's going to have a big impact , " hoeness said . in the bundesliga , that may be true .

according to hoeness , a deal with podolski 's agent for the player was " as good as agreed " although bayern have yet to speak to cologne . prince poldi and van buyten targeted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buyten could be saying his farewells to hamburg another addition could be rivals sv hamburg 's inspirational captain daniel van buyten .
" he has let it be known that he wants to come to us , " hoeness said of the 28-year-old belgian centre-back .
" now he has to discuss it with hamburg . " but whoever comes in at the allianz arena , it will be very hard to fill the void left by the expected departure of ballack , germany 's one true world star .
ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .
his association with the club has helped the one outstanding german team command a higher profile on the global soccer stage . ballack defection a sign of bayern waning power ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack lured by chelsea 's money and future success ?
however , his anticipated loss to the english champions will expose bayern 's shortcomings both on and off the pitch where richer and potentially more successful clubs can swoop for their players in the same way as bayern feed of their rivals in the domestic transfer market . off the pitch , even if podolski and van buyten come , the bavarians will still need to find someone who can play such an effective all-round game in midfield and bring that star quality to the team . hoeness believes that man will be julio dos santos , the 22-year-old paraguay midfielder who joined bayern in january but who has yet to make his bundesliga debut .
" he 's going to have a big impact , " hoeness said . in the bundesliga , that may be true .
but the real question for a club which craves european success as much as bayern is : can he be the new michael ballack ?
the most likely answer to that is that you can not replace the irreplaceable . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern win 20th german league title in kaiserslautern draw one week after winning the german cup , bayern munich also laid claim to the german championship in the season 's penultimate week on saturday and became the first team to achieve the double victory two years in a row .

the girls ' actions were generally read as a political statement , and the pair was suspended from school .
the burka became well known in the west after it became mandatory garb for afghan women under the reactionary taliban regime . in an interview with the welt on sonntag newspaper about whether veiled pupils should be allowed to attend class in german high schools , zypries said " a simple solution to end the conflict would be having all students , male or female , wear uniforms to school .
that would not only get rid of burkas , but also clear up problems of social inequality " that get lived out through clothing . zypries warned about increasing resentment against foreigners in the schools , in part on religious grounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people do n't want to see burkas in german schools but a cry of opposition went out almost immediately .
the president of the german teachers ' association , josef kraus , called zypries " incredibly naive " to think religious and social discrimination could be reduced by introducing uniforms .
moreover , germany has a " problematic tradition " when it comes to school uniforms , kraus told netzeitung internet portal . uniforms in public institutions still call up the group mentality of the nazi era in germany . despite this , there have been occasional , though relatively isolated , attempts to introduce uniforms in german schools .
recently , two schools in the berlin district of spandau considered switching to school uniforms . advocates say uniforms do away with " brand envy " and reduce the chances of children from poorer families being ostracized because they can not afford the latest fashions .
and , they say , uniforms foster the feeling of being part of a group , and can help students identify with and even have pride in their school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries but up to now , the conference of education ministers that decide on national school policies , called the kmk , has come out against school uniforms .
they , too , cite historical reasons dating back to wwii , with the memories of uniforms worn by the hitler youth still too fresh in the public mind . on top of that , the conference has said , any general uniform rule would raise questions about how far the government can encroach on the personal liberties of students and parents . green opposition zypries ' remarks also met with strong criticism from germany 's green party , which has long championed a multicultural german society .
krista sager , a senior green party member , said the introduction of school uniforms would be an unacceptable interference by the state in religious affairs . " we certainly do n't need solutions imposed by the government .
what we need are individual solutions by the schools themselves that respect the situation on the ground and notably the religious freedom of pupils .
the introduction of school uniforms is generally no longer up to date and would be rejected by current generations of school students . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wearing school uniforms does n't appear to make these students - in australia - unhappy in europe , great britain is known as the nation that continues to impose uniforms on students .
but a spokesperson for zypries said the minister made it clear she was not talking introducing british-style uniforms in germany .
it would be more of a case of students wearing unified pants , t-shirts , and sweatshirts . ulrich stahnke , headmaster of the school in bonn where the outcry began , called the debate about the introduction of school uniforms counterproductive .

the girls ' actions were generally read as a political statement , and the pair was suspended from school .
the burka became well known in the west after it became mandatory garb for afghan women under the reactionary taliban regime . in an interview with the welt on sonntag newspaper about whether veiled pupils should be allowed to attend class in german high schools , zypries said " a simple solution to end the conflict would be having all students , male or female , wear uniforms to school .
that would not only get rid of burkas , but also clear up problems of social inequality " that get lived out through clothing . zypries warned about increasing resentment against foreigners in the schools , in part on religious grounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people do n't want to see burkas in german schools but a cry of opposition went out almost immediately .
the president of the german teachers ' association , josef kraus , called zypries " incredibly naive " to think religious and social discrimination could be reduced by introducing uniforms .
moreover , germany has a " problematic tradition " when it comes to school uniforms , kraus told netzeitung internet portal . uniforms in public institutions still call up the group mentality of the nazi era in germany . despite this , there have been occasional , though relatively isolated , attempts to introduce uniforms in german schools .
recently , two schools in the berlin district of spandau considered switching to school uniforms . advocates say uniforms do away with " brand envy " and reduce the chances of children from poorer families being ostracized because they can not afford the latest fashions .
and , they say , uniforms foster the feeling of being part of a group , and can help students identify with and even have pride in their school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries but up to now , the conference of education ministers that decide on national school policies , called the kmk , has come out against school uniforms .
they , too , cite historical reasons dating back to wwii , with the memories of uniforms worn by the hitler youth still too fresh in the public mind . on top of that , the conference has said , any general uniform rule would raise questions about how far the government can encroach on the personal liberties of students and parents . green opposition zypries ' remarks also met with strong criticism from germany 's green party , which has long championed a multicultural german society .
krista sager , a senior green party member , said the introduction of school uniforms would be an unacceptable interference by the state in religious affairs . " we certainly do n't need solutions imposed by the government .
what we need are individual solutions by the schools themselves that respect the situation on the ground and notably the religious freedom of pupils .
the introduction of school uniforms is generally no longer up to date and would be rejected by current generations of school students . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wearing school uniforms does n't appear to make these students - in australia - unhappy in europe , great britain is known as the nation that continues to impose uniforms on students .
but a spokesperson for zypries said the minister made it clear she was not talking introducing british-style uniforms in germany .
it would be more of a case of students wearing unified pants , t-shirts , and sweatshirts . ulrich stahnke , headmaster of the school in bonn where the outcry began , called the debate about the introduction of school uniforms counterproductive . " it 's important to understand that solutions can only be found in cooperation with immigrant communities .
decisions made by religious outsiders like us are not accepted by muslims .

only a handful of german schools have uniforms , but several are experimenting with the idea , hoping they can encourage reduced competition among students for the latest designer labels .

angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .
but the hospitality afforded her may be part of a ruse to lure germany into the us foreign policy fold , according to dw 's peter philipp . it appears that german chancellor angela merkel knows how to deal with the man in the white house .
just how well can be judged by the applause she gets on her visits to washington . the ease with which merkel deals with bush , the chemistry she helps to create between them and the success of the meetings between the two leaders can be judged by the length of these outbursts of appreciation and measured by how many minutes they run over their expected duration . but while the applause can be used as a yardstick to gauge merkel 's growing stature in german-us affairs , the responses to the german chancellor are not just about her own performance and the growing respect for her in the states .
it is not only frau merkel who is on the charm offensive .
president bush wants to win germany and the germans over and bring them into line with his foreign policy . bush turning on his own charm to win over germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush is liking what he 's hearing from germany bush is now willing to appear on german talk shows and give exclusive interviews to tabloids as well as accepting an invitation from merkel to visit her constituency in germany . he has also apparently swallowed the bitter pill of germany 's opposition to the iraq war and has made clumsy attempts at expressing his understanding of why the germans so vehemently opposed the 2003 invasion . for bush , iraq is in the past .
his current preoccupation is iran .
and to make any kind of progress in this situation , bush needs all the support he can get . there is none of that coming from china and russia , about which the us issued a report calling vladimir putin 's country a failing democracy .
this is , however , nothing new in washington 's thinking , and bush still considers putin to be someone he can talk with . talk , maybe , but there is no guarantee that any discussions will be able to persuade putin to take the us-favored stance on iran .
merkel , however , is a different matter - at least in bush 's view .
while russia and china see the perceived anti-iran strategy in the us as an obstacle , berlin appears to be aligned with washington . is berlin ready for the us version of diplomacy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the chancellor ready to fully endorse us foreign policy ?
merkel 's public declarations on this alignment are based on the common desire to solve " the problem " through diplomacy .
however , it has long been accepted that the white house version of diplomacy means that the opposition must give in to the us way of thinking . if this does n't happen - and tehran has given no indication that it is ready to bend to us will - then diplomacy gives way to the use of power . is germany ready to follow the us down this path ?
did bush make a good case to the chancellor regarding this possibility in the privacy of the oval office ?
and if merkel ’ s germany is to follow bush on iran , will it also be prepared to back up us solidarity with israel with action if necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when gerhard schröder declared a similar " unlimited solidarity " with the us after september 11 , 2001 , it alienated some germans .
and this time the consequences could be even more drastic . those who are celebrating a new dawn in german-us relations should look beyond the applause and the reciprocation of praise .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite better economic signals in germany , other countries are doing better according to the study which was commissioned by die welt daily , spain could have higher per-capita income than germany by 2008 , and italy may achieve that goal by 2014 .

and just like robin hood and his men , a gang of hamburg activists are proving difficult to catch despite the fact they dress as superheroes when they raid swanky stores . a bunch of egalitarian criminals who go by such names as " spider mum " and " santa guevara " are being referred to as modern-day germany 's version of robin hood and his merry men .
and just like the sheriff of nottingham in the legend of sherwood forest 's most famous outlaw , the hamburg police are at a loss when it comes to stopping them . the group , which calls itself " hamburg umsonst " - loosely translated as hamburg without charge , has apparently graduated from handing out flyers with tips on how to forge cinema tickets and travel illegally on public transport to raiding the swankiest stores and delicatessens before distributing their swag to the city 's poor . their most high profile job to date came last week .
dressed in an array of comic book hero costumes , the gang raided a well-to-do eatery in the north german port city last friday during work hours and absconded with a large amount of fine food - after posing for a publicity photograph with bemused staff .
hamburg cops called to the crime scene drew a blank despite deploying 14 patrol cars and a police helicopter . according to eye witnesses , the " hamburg umsonst " raiding party consisted of around 30 people who apparently knew what they were doing when it came to fancy eats and drinks .
the everyday shoplifter will probably not take the time to savor the array of produce on hand before sticking a box of valrhona chocolates down their pants .
it soon became obvious - these guys were pros . cops ca n't catch connoisseur crooks in costumes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gang 's get-away plan left the cops trailing behind the hamburg cops have little to go on except that the gang has a social conscience , know the difference between corned beef and kobe veal and have a seemingly unlimited supply of fancy dress costumes . but even the best laid plans of criminal masterminds have the odd weak spot .
while carrying out their raids in order to support the one-euro jobbers , exploited employees and those on benefits , the gang have been unable to resist the sating of the ego . in what could eventually be their undoing , the caped food raiders have shown a penchant for leaving notes at the scene of their crimes which carry statements such as : " without the abilities of a superhero , survival is impossible in the town of the millionaires . " until the police get a break , upmarket shopkeepers in hamburg are advised to keep their doors closed to anyone wearing spandex tights and a mexican wrestling mask . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de laughable law breakers germany has its fair share of unusual and sometimes inept law breakers .

and just like robin hood and his men , a gang of hamburg activists are proving difficult to catch despite the fact they dress as superheroes when they raid swanky stores . a bunch of egalitarian criminals who go by such names as " spider mum " and " santa guevara " are being referred to as modern-day germany 's version of robin hood and his merry men .
and just like the sheriff of nottingham in the legend of sherwood forest 's most famous outlaw , the hamburg police are at a loss when it comes to stopping them . the group , which calls itself " hamburg umsonst " - loosely translated as hamburg without charge , has apparently graduated from handing out flyers with tips on how to forge cinema tickets and travel illegally on public transport to raiding the swankiest stores and delicatessens before distributing their swag to the city 's poor . their most high profile job to date came last week .
dressed in an array of comic book hero costumes , the gang raided a well-to-do eatery in the north german port city last friday during work hours and absconded with a large amount of fine food - after posing for a publicity photograph with bemused staff .

however , looking farther ahead , the commission predicted in its spring economic forecasts that growth would slow to 1.8 percent next year .
it also estimated that growth in the 25-nation eu would peak this year at 2.3 percent after 1.6 percent last year .
growth was forecast to ease back slightly to 2.2 percent next year . " both the eu and the euro area are expected to grow markedly stronger this year , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . european economies were reaping the benefits this year of firming domestic and foreign demand , which encouraged companies to make investments even though rising interest rates were making borrowing more expensive . the commission said in the report containing its forecasts that " investment is set to continue growing at a rapid pace underpinned by optimistic business sentiment , a favorable profit outlook and the increased need for replacement investment . "
germany singled out the commission singled out germany as a bright spot and forecast that the growth rate of the biggest euro-zone economy would nearly double this year to 1.7 percent from 0.9 percent last year .
in february , brussels had forecast that the german economy would grow 1.5 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs joaquin almunia the german economy was benefiting from households splurging this year on consumer goods ahead of a planned increase in value added tax next year , the commission said , predicting that growth would ease " temporarily " to 1.0 percent in 2007 . the stronger growth across europe would help bring down stubbornly high unemployment , which was seen falling to 8.4 percent of the euro-zone workforce this year from 8.6 percent in 2005 .
oil prices pose big risk despite the improving economic outlook however , public finances in the euro zone were not expected to strengthen .
the commission predicted that the combined public deficit of euro-zone members would stand at 2.4 percent , the same as next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil prices could spell trouble for euro zone economies the inflation front was expected to hold steady , meanwhile , even though oil prices recently hit all-time highs on global markets .
following a rate of 2.2 percent in 2005 , euro-zone inflation was forecast to remain at 2.2 percent this year and next . however , the commission said that oil prices represented the " biggest near-term risk " to european economies .
" the very low spare capacities make markets extremely vulnerable to actual and potential supply disruptions , " the commission said . because of market volatility , forecasts that oil would average $ 68.9 per barrel for 2006 and $ 71 per barrel for 2007 were subject to change , it added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economy gathers steam , institutes revise forecast german economic performance is predicted to grow by 1.8 percent in 2006 , the highest rate in six years , the country 's six leading economic institutes said .

who 's to blame ?
the parents or the school system ?
or both ? politicians of all stripes agree on one thing : the equally gifted child from a working class immigrant background should have the same chance to enter university as the son of a dentist .
since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration issues are n't the only problems german schools have " the educational system is not the cause of problems , but reflects society as a whole .
in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with learning difficulties may not get the support they need in school " there are so many pupils from families who offer no support whatsoever .
so many parents could n't care less , " said barbara brüse , a primary school teacher in bonn who has spent decades teaching immigrant children . parents can even be counterproductive when faced with a bright child .
only 36 percent of migrant children who have the smarts to attend gymnasium do so , according to heinz-peter meidinger .

with praise for another record-breaking season still ringing in their ears , bayern munich 's hierarchy begin to plan for another season of dominance . bayern 's 1-1 draw with kaiserslautern on saturday coupled with sv hamburg 's 4-2 loss against hertha berlin helped the club to a 20th domestic title adding to their cup triumph over eintracht frankfurt . the title win gave the bavarian giants another record : the first team to win a league and cup double in successive seasons . " it is great to wrap up the title with a week to go , " said bayern munich coach felix magath .
" to defend the double is unique and the team has been exceptional .
we can all be very proud of our achievement and there will be some celebrations tonight for sure . " magath arrived from vfb stuttgart in july 2004 and has lifted back-to-back doubles in his first two seasons . " full credit to felix -lrb- magath -rrb- .
he has won two league and cup doubles in a row .
that is mightily impressive , " said general manager uli hoeness . bayern were far from convincing against lowly kaiserslautern but captain oliver kahn saluted his team for winning a sixth title in eight seasons .
" kaiserslautern made it difficult but we have a lot of experience in title battles and used it , " said the german international goalkeeper . " we have dominated the league this season and deserve to win the title .
you need to come up with the big points at the right time and we did that . " closest rivals gracious in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas ottl squeezes in the title-winning goal sv hamburg were bayern 's main challengers this season but their manager thomas doll admitted the best team had won .
" congratulations to bayern on their title win , " doll said .
" they were the best team and deserved to finish top . " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf , who led the club to the title in 2004 , also saluted bayern 's achievements .
" i offer my compliments to bayern .
they were incredibly consistent all season and that is the difference , " said schaaf . former bayern star mario basler congratulated his ex-club - where he won three bundesliga titles - but admitted he was hoping for some stronger competition in the future .
" well done to bayern but to be honest it is getting a bit boring now , " basler said . bayern have won 20 domestic titles with fc nuremberg the next best on nine although their last triumph came way back in 1968 . bayern oils the revolving door for summer sales for bayern to win their 21st title next season , there will have to be a change of personnel as a number of senior players - most notably the chelsea-bound michael ballack - are considering ending their association with the record-breaking bundesliga champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even physical restraint is unlikely to stop podolski leaving while speculation is rife about those who will be on their way out , one who seems destined to be on his way in is fc cologne striker lukas podolski . the 20-year-old international forward is regarded as one of germany 's best young players and since his current club are due to be relegated at the end of this season , it seems most likely that he will continue his career in the top flight by joining the powerful bavarians for the next campaign . " we 'll carry out talks with a view to getting him by july 1 , " bayern manager uli hoeness told reporters in cologne .
according to hoeness , a deal with podolski 's agent for the player was " as good as agreed " although bayern have yet to speak to cologne . prince poldi and van buyten targeted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buyten could be saying his farewells to hamburg another addition could be rivals sv hamburg 's inspirational captain daniel van buyten .
" he has let it be known that he wants to come to us , " hoeness said of the 28-year-old belgian centre-back .
" now he has to discuss it with hamburg . " but whoever comes in at the allianz arena , it will be very hard to fill the void left by the expected departure of ballack , germany 's one true world star .
ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .
his association with the club has helped the one outstanding german team command a higher profile on the global soccer stage . ballack defection a sign of bayern waning power ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack lured by chelsea 's money and future success ?
however , his anticipated loss to the english champions will expose bayern 's shortcomings both on and off the pitch where richer and potentially more successful clubs can swoop for their players in the same way as bayern feed of their rivals in the domestic transfer market . off the pitch , even if podolski and van buyten come , the bavarians will still need to find someone who can play such an effective all-round game in midfield and bring that star quality to the team . hoeness believes that man will be julio dos santos , the 22-year-old paraguay midfielder who joined bayern in january but who has yet to make his bundesliga debut .
" he 's going to have a big impact , " hoeness said . in the bundesliga , that may be true .
but the real question for a club which craves european success as much as bayern is : can he be the new michael ballack ?
the most likely answer to that is that you can not replace the irreplaceable . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern win 20th german league title in kaiserslautern draw one week after winning the german cup , bayern munich also laid claim to the german championship in the season 's penultimate week on saturday and became the first team to achieve the double victory two years in a row .

ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .

with praise for another record-breaking season still ringing in their ears , bayern munich 's hierarchy begin to plan for another season of dominance . bayern 's 1-1 draw with kaiserslautern on saturday coupled with sv hamburg 's 4-2 loss against hertha berlin helped the club to a 20th domestic title adding to their cup triumph over eintracht frankfurt . the title win gave the bavarian giants another record : the first team to win a league and cup double in successive seasons . " it is great to wrap up the title with a week to go , " said bayern munich coach felix magath .
" to defend the double is unique and the team has been exceptional .
we can all be very proud of our achievement and there will be some celebrations tonight for sure . " magath arrived from vfb stuttgart in july 2004 and has lifted back-to-back doubles in his first two seasons . " full credit to felix -lrb- magath -rrb- .
he has won two league and cup doubles in a row .
that is mightily impressive , " said general manager uli hoeness . bayern were far from convincing against lowly kaiserslautern but captain oliver kahn saluted his team for winning a sixth title in eight seasons .
" kaiserslautern made it difficult but we have a lot of experience in title battles and used it , " said the german international goalkeeper . " we have dominated the league this season and deserve to win the title .
you need to come up with the big points at the right time and we did that . " closest rivals gracious in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas ottl squeezes in the title-winning goal sv hamburg were bayern 's main challengers this season but their manager thomas doll admitted the best team had won .
" congratulations to bayern on their title win , " doll said .
" they were the best team and deserved to finish top . " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf , who led the club to the title in 2004 , also saluted bayern 's achievements .
" i offer my compliments to bayern .
they were incredibly consistent all season and that is the difference , " said schaaf . former bayern star mario basler congratulated his ex-club - where he won three bundesliga titles - but admitted he was hoping for some stronger competition in the future .
" well done to bayern but to be honest it is getting a bit boring now , " basler said . bayern have won 20 domestic titles with fc nuremberg the next best on nine although their last triumph came way back in 1968 . bayern oils the revolving door for summer sales for bayern to win their 21st title next season , there will have to be a change of personnel as a number of senior players - most notably the chelsea-bound michael ballack - are considering ending their association with the record-breaking bundesliga champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even physical restraint is unlikely to stop podolski leaving while speculation is rife about those who will be on their way out , one who seems destined to be on his way in is fc cologne striker lukas podolski . the 20-year-old international forward is regarded as one of germany 's best young players and since his current club are due to be relegated at the end of this season , it seems most likely that he will continue his career in the top flight by joining the powerful bavarians for the next campaign . " we 'll carry out talks with a view to getting him by july 1 , " bayern manager uli hoeness told reporters in cologne .
according to hoeness , a deal with podolski 's agent for the player was " as good as agreed " although bayern have yet to speak to cologne . prince poldi and van buyten targeted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buyten could be saying his farewells to hamburg another addition could be rivals sv hamburg 's inspirational captain daniel van buyten .
" he has let it be known that he wants to come to us , " hoeness said of the 28-year-old belgian centre-back .
" now he has to discuss it with hamburg . " but whoever comes in at the allianz arena , it will be very hard to fill the void left by the expected departure of ballack , germany 's one true world star .
ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .
his association with the club has helped the one outstanding german team command a higher profile on the global soccer stage . ballack defection a sign of bayern waning power ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack lured by chelsea 's money and future success ?
however , his anticipated loss to the english champions will expose bayern 's shortcomings both on and off the pitch where richer and potentially more successful clubs can swoop for their players in the same way as bayern feed of their rivals in the domestic transfer market . off the pitch , even if podolski and van buyten come , the bavarians will still need to find someone who can play such an effective all-round game in midfield and bring that star quality to the team . hoeness believes that man will be julio dos santos , the 22-year-old paraguay midfielder who joined bayern in january but who has yet to make his bundesliga debut .
" he 's going to have a big impact , " hoeness said . in the bundesliga , that may be true .
but the real question for a club which craves european success as much as bayern is : can he be the new michael ballack ?

the girls ' actions were generally read as a political statement , and the pair was suspended from school .
the burka became well known in the west after it became mandatory garb for afghan women under the reactionary taliban regime . in an interview with the welt on sonntag newspaper about whether veiled pupils should be allowed to attend class in german high schools , zypries said " a simple solution to end the conflict would be having all students , male or female , wear uniforms to school .
that would not only get rid of burkas , but also clear up problems of social inequality " that get lived out through clothing . zypries warned about increasing resentment against foreigners in the schools , in part on religious grounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people do n't want to see burkas in german schools but a cry of opposition went out almost immediately .
the president of the german teachers ' association , josef kraus , called zypries " incredibly naive " to think religious and social discrimination could be reduced by introducing uniforms .
moreover , germany has a " problematic tradition " when it comes to school uniforms , kraus told netzeitung internet portal . uniforms in public institutions still call up the group mentality of the nazi era in germany . despite this , there have been occasional , though relatively isolated , attempts to introduce uniforms in german schools .
recently , two schools in the berlin district of spandau considered switching to school uniforms . advocates say uniforms do away with " brand envy " and reduce the chances of children from poorer families being ostracized because they can not afford the latest fashions .
and , they say , uniforms foster the feeling of being part of a group , and can help students identify with and even have pride in their school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries but up to now , the conference of education ministers that decide on national school policies , called the kmk , has come out against school uniforms .
they , too , cite historical reasons dating back to wwii , with the memories of uniforms worn by the hitler youth still too fresh in the public mind . on top of that , the conference has said , any general uniform rule would raise questions about how far the government can encroach on the personal liberties of students and parents . green opposition zypries ' remarks also met with strong criticism from germany 's green party , which has long championed a multicultural german society .
krista sager , a senior green party member , said the introduction of school uniforms would be an unacceptable interference by the state in religious affairs . " we certainly do n't need solutions imposed by the government .
what we need are individual solutions by the schools themselves that respect the situation on the ground and notably the religious freedom of pupils .
the introduction of school uniforms is generally no longer up to date and would be rejected by current generations of school students . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wearing school uniforms does n't appear to make these students - in australia - unhappy in europe , great britain is known as the nation that continues to impose uniforms on students .
but a spokesperson for zypries said the minister made it clear she was not talking introducing british-style uniforms in germany .
it would be more of a case of students wearing unified pants , t-shirts , and sweatshirts . ulrich stahnke , headmaster of the school in bonn where the outcry began , called the debate about the introduction of school uniforms counterproductive .

the girls ' actions were generally read as a political statement , and the pair was suspended from school .
the burka became well known in the west after it became mandatory garb for afghan women under the reactionary taliban regime . in an interview with the welt on sonntag newspaper about whether veiled pupils should be allowed to attend class in german high schools , zypries said " a simple solution to end the conflict would be having all students , male or female , wear uniforms to school .
that would not only get rid of burkas , but also clear up problems of social inequality " that get lived out through clothing . zypries warned about increasing resentment against foreigners in the schools , in part on religious grounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people do n't want to see burkas in german schools but a cry of opposition went out almost immediately .
the president of the german teachers ' association , josef kraus , called zypries " incredibly naive " to think religious and social discrimination could be reduced by introducing uniforms .
moreover , germany has a " problematic tradition " when it comes to school uniforms , kraus told netzeitung internet portal . uniforms in public institutions still call up the group mentality of the nazi era in germany . despite this , there have been occasional , though relatively isolated , attempts to introduce uniforms in german schools .
recently , two schools in the berlin district of spandau considered switching to school uniforms . advocates say uniforms do away with " brand envy " and reduce the chances of children from poorer families being ostracized because they can not afford the latest fashions .
and , they say , uniforms foster the feeling of being part of a group , and can help students identify with and even have pride in their school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries but up to now , the conference of education ministers that decide on national school policies , called the kmk , has come out against school uniforms .
they , too , cite historical reasons dating back to wwii , with the memories of uniforms worn by the hitler youth still too fresh in the public mind . on top of that , the conference has said , any general uniform rule would raise questions about how far the government can encroach on the personal liberties of students and parents . green opposition zypries ' remarks also met with strong criticism from germany 's green party , which has long championed a multicultural german society .
krista sager , a senior green party member , said the introduction of school uniforms would be an unacceptable interference by the state in religious affairs . " we certainly do n't need solutions imposed by the government .
what we need are individual solutions by the schools themselves that respect the situation on the ground and notably the religious freedom of pupils .
the introduction of school uniforms is generally no longer up to date and would be rejected by current generations of school students . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wearing school uniforms does n't appear to make these students - in australia - unhappy in europe , great britain is known as the nation that continues to impose uniforms on students .
but a spokesperson for zypries said the minister made it clear she was not talking introducing british-style uniforms in germany .
it would be more of a case of students wearing unified pants , t-shirts , and sweatshirts . ulrich stahnke , headmaster of the school in bonn where the outcry began , called the debate about the introduction of school uniforms counterproductive .

and just like the sheriff of nottingham in the legend of sherwood forest 's most famous outlaw , the hamburg police are at a loss when it comes to stopping them . the group , which calls itself " hamburg umsonst " - loosely translated as hamburg without charge , has apparently graduated from handing out flyers with tips on how to forge cinema tickets and travel illegally on public transport to raiding the swankiest stores and delicatessens before distributing their swag to the city 's poor . their most high profile job to date came last week .
dressed in an array of comic book hero costumes , the gang raided a well-to-do eatery in the north german port city last friday during work hours and absconded with a large amount of fine food - after posing for a publicity photograph with bemused staff .

while carrying out their raids in order to support the one-euro jobbers , exploited employees and those on benefits , the gang have been unable to resist the sating of the ego . in what could eventually be their undoing , the caped food raiders have shown a penchant for leaving notes at the scene of their crimes which carry statements such as : " without the abilities of a superhero , survival is impossible in the town of the millionaires .

after the match , they 're all going to need a place to sleep that leaves enough euros in their pocket for a celebratory dinner . the average price for accommodation during the world cup is 190 euros -lrb- $ 241 -rrb- per night - including everything from a youth hostel dorm room to a multi-star hotel suite , according to the fifa world cup accommodation services .
that 's a price some fans ca n't afford , according to ergin iyilikci , spokesperson for immobilienscout24 , an online real estate agent that has set up a special web site for people looking to rooms during the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even they will tire out eventually " the average hotel rates can make for a pricey night , " he said , explaining why young people and families are especially interested in internet sites where they have a chance to stay in the homes of other soccer fans at more affordable rates or free of charge . even for those willing to pay hotel prices , it is likely that there will not be enough rooms available , according nikola günther , who runs another site connecting tired world cup fans with empty beds . dema n d expected to i n crease i n may a n d ju n e " as soon as the decision was made that the world cup would take place in germany , we realized the number of hotel beds would not be enough , " günther said , adding that the site 's average price is between 20 euros and 40 euros per night . the more than 15,000 housing ads , including everything from a spare couch in the living room , to entire apartments and even a multi-room villa , currently outstrip demand , but that 's expected to change as the cup approaches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spare sofa is all some soccer fans are looking for the lists of accommodation are free to people looking for a place to stay , some , however , charge potential hosts as a way of filtering jokers registering their neighbor 's house from serious offers .
hosts are given free reign in determining how much to charge guests . " we 're convinced supply and demand will keep the prices under control , " iyilikci said .
" people who want 500 euros a night wo n't find anyone interested in their place . " rooms cheaper , more perso n al i n host 's home many of the people offering to put up a stranded soccer fan or two , like munich 's gerhard schubert , are n't asking for any payment at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many desperate soccer fans could squeeze into the typical living room ?
" i would much rather stay somewhere more personal than a hotel when i travel and thought i could give the same chance to someone else , " said the 43-year-old soccer fan , who is offering to pull out the sofa-bed in his guest room free of charge .
" i know how expensive munich can be . " andreas schlüter , 27 , said he and his roommate thought offering their hamburg apartment 's extra room to soccer fans was a great idea . " the world cup is called ' a time to make friends , ' and i think that should be brought to life , " he said , adding that he is n't worried about sharing his apartment with hooligans .
" i think only open people with good intentions take part in things like this .

" for 90 minutes a healthy rivalry dominates everything - that 's good because that 's what makes soccer great , " he said .
" then you can talk reasonably to each other and go out and have a beer together . " an advantage of staying with a fellow fan instead of in generic hotel room is that soccer fans tend to know where the city 's best bars , restaurants and places to watch the game are , bialojahn added . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a woman 's place is in the stadium soccer games have always been a predominantly male bastion in germany .

with praise for another record-breaking season still ringing in their ears , bayern munich 's hierarchy begin to plan for another season of dominance . bayern 's 1-1 draw with kaiserslautern on saturday coupled with sv hamburg 's 4-2 loss against hertha berlin helped the club to a 20th domestic title adding to their cup triumph over eintracht frankfurt . the title win gave the bavarian giants another record : the first team to win a league and cup double in successive seasons . " it is great to wrap up the title with a week to go , " said bayern munich coach felix magath .
" to defend the double is unique and the team has been exceptional .
we can all be very proud of our achievement and there will be some celebrations tonight for sure . " magath arrived from vfb stuttgart in july 2004 and has lifted back-to-back doubles in his first two seasons . " full credit to felix -lrb- magath -rrb- .
he has won two league and cup doubles in a row .
that is mightily impressive , " said general manager uli hoeness . bayern were far from convincing against lowly kaiserslautern but captain oliver kahn saluted his team for winning a sixth title in eight seasons .
" kaiserslautern made it difficult but we have a lot of experience in title battles and used it , " said the german international goalkeeper . " we have dominated the league this season and deserve to win the title .
you need to come up with the big points at the right time and we did that . " closest rivals gracious in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas ottl squeezes in the title-winning goal sv hamburg were bayern 's main challengers this season but their manager thomas doll admitted the best team had won .
" congratulations to bayern on their title win , " doll said .
" they were the best team and deserved to finish top . " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf , who led the club to the title in 2004 , also saluted bayern 's achievements .
" i offer my compliments to bayern .
they were incredibly consistent all season and that is the difference , " said schaaf . former bayern star mario basler congratulated his ex-club - where he won three bundesliga titles - but admitted he was hoping for some stronger competition in the future .
" well done to bayern but to be honest it is getting a bit boring now , " basler said . bayern have won 20 domestic titles with fc nuremberg the next best on nine although their last triumph came way back in 1968 . bayern oils the revolving door for summer sales for bayern to win their 21st title next season , there will have to be a change of personnel as a number of senior players - most notably the chelsea-bound michael ballack - are considering ending their association with the record-breaking bundesliga champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even physical restraint is unlikely to stop podolski leaving while speculation is rife about those who will be on their way out , one who seems destined to be on his way in is fc cologne striker lukas podolski . the 20-year-old international forward is regarded as one of germany 's best young players and since his current club are due to be relegated at the end of this season , it seems most likely that he will continue his career in the top flight by joining the powerful bavarians for the next campaign . " we 'll carry out talks with a view to getting him by july 1 , " bayern manager uli hoeness told reporters in cologne .
according to hoeness , a deal with podolski 's agent for the player was " as good as agreed " although bayern have yet to speak to cologne . prince poldi and van buyten targeted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buyten could be saying his farewells to hamburg another addition could be rivals sv hamburg 's inspirational captain daniel van buyten .
" he has let it be known that he wants to come to us , " hoeness said of the 28-year-old belgian centre-back .
" now he has to discuss it with hamburg . " but whoever comes in at the allianz arena , it will be very hard to fill the void left by the expected departure of ballack , germany 's one true world star .
ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .
his association with the club has helped the one outstanding german team command a higher profile on the global soccer stage . ballack defection a sign of bayern waning power ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack lured by chelsea 's money and future success ?
however , his anticipated loss to the english champions will expose bayern 's shortcomings both on and off the pitch where richer and potentially more successful clubs can swoop for their players in the same way as bayern feed of their rivals in the domestic transfer market . off the pitch , even if podolski and van buyten come , the bavarians will still need to find someone who can play such an effective all-round game in midfield and bring that star quality to the team . hoeness believes that man will be julio dos santos , the 22-year-old paraguay midfielder who joined bayern in january but who has yet to make his bundesliga debut .
" he 's going to have a big impact , " hoeness said . in the bundesliga , that may be true .
but the real question for a club which craves european success as much as bayern is : can he be the new michael ballack ?
the most likely answer to that is that you can not replace the irreplaceable . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern win 20th german league title in kaiserslautern draw one week after winning the german cup , bayern munich also laid claim to the german championship in the season 's penultimate week on saturday and became the first team to achieve the double victory two years in a row .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite better economic signals in germany , other countries are doing better according to the study which was commissioned by die welt daily , spain could have higher per-capita income than germany by 2008 , and italy may achieve that goal by 2014 .
by 2020 , only greece and portugal would report lower per-capita income than germany . reunification effect experts pointed to a one-time , long-lasting effect of reunification to explain germany 's slide down the wealth ladder . moreover , said stefan bergheim , an economist at deutsche bank research : " for years now , germany has missed the opportunity to plan for its own future and come up with a consistent growth strategy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.05.2006 in germany , veiled students stir up uniform debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one potsdam school introduced a dress code in january a debate over whether to mandate school uniforms in germany broke out after two muslim girls were suspended from school in bonn for coming veiled from head to toe in a traditional opaque garb known as a burka . over the weekend , german justice minister brigitte zypries spoke out in favor of introducing school uniforms , unleashing a storm of opinion from commentators and politicians across the country . the debate broke out anew after two 18-year-old muslim girls came to their high school in bonn dressed in traditional burkas - veils that covered them entirely , except for a small mesh slit at the eyes .
the girls ' actions were generally read as a political statement , and the pair was suspended from school .
the burka became well known in the west after it became mandatory garb for afghan women under the reactionary taliban regime . in an interview with the welt on sonntag newspaper about whether veiled pupils should be allowed to attend class in german high schools , zypries said " a simple solution to end the conflict would be having all students , male or female , wear uniforms to school .
that would not only get rid of burkas , but also clear up problems of social inequality " that get lived out through clothing . zypries warned about increasing resentment against foreigners in the schools , in part on religious grounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people do n't want to see burkas in german schools but a cry of opposition went out almost immediately .
the president of the german teachers ' association , josef kraus , called zypries " incredibly naive " to think religious and social discrimination could be reduced by introducing uniforms .
moreover , germany has a " problematic tradition " when it comes to school uniforms , kraus told netzeitung internet portal . uniforms in public institutions still call up the group mentality of the nazi era in germany . despite this , there have been occasional , though relatively isolated , attempts to introduce uniforms in german schools .
recently , two schools in the berlin district of spandau considered switching to school uniforms . advocates say uniforms do away with " brand envy " and reduce the chances of children from poorer families being ostracized because they can not afford the latest fashions .
and , they say , uniforms foster the feeling of being part of a group , and can help students identify with and even have pride in their school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries but up to now , the conference of education ministers that decide on national school policies , called the kmk , has come out against school uniforms .
they , too , cite historical reasons dating back to wwii , with the memories of uniforms worn by the hitler youth still too fresh in the public mind . on top of that , the conference has said , any general uniform rule would raise questions about how far the government can encroach on the personal liberties of students and parents . green opposition zypries ' remarks also met with strong criticism from germany 's green party , which has long championed a multicultural german society .
krista sager , a senior green party member , said the introduction of school uniforms would be an unacceptable interference by the state in religious affairs . " we certainly do n't need solutions imposed by the government .
what we need are individual solutions by the schools themselves that respect the situation on the ground and notably the religious freedom of pupils .
the introduction of school uniforms is generally no longer up to date and would be rejected by current generations of school students . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wearing school uniforms does n't appear to make these students - in australia - unhappy in europe , great britain is known as the nation that continues to impose uniforms on students .
but a spokesperson for zypries said the minister made it clear she was not talking introducing british-style uniforms in germany .
it would be more of a case of students wearing unified pants , t-shirts , and sweatshirts . ulrich stahnke , headmaster of the school in bonn where the outcry began , called the debate about the introduction of school uniforms counterproductive . " it 's important to understand that solutions can only be found in cooperation with immigrant communities .
decisions made by religious outsiders like us are not accepted by muslims .
but at my school it 's now important to make clear to them that we can not accept the burka . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do clothes make the student ?
only a handful of german schools have uniforms , but several are experimenting with the idea , hoping they can encourage reduced competition among students for the latest designer labels .
critics call it forced conformity .
-lrb- feb .
23 , 2005 -rrb- school suspends burka-clad students a high school in the german city of bonn has suspended two muslim girls for wearing a burka , an all-enveloping cloak worn by women in central and south asia .
-lrb- may 2 , 2006 -rrb- no solution other than police presence for unruly berlin school police have stepped in at a berlin school to help control violence that teachers say is out of control .
berlin ’ s education senator is coming under heavy criticism for refusing to close the secondary school down .

angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .
but the hospitality afforded her may be part of a ruse to lure germany into the us foreign policy fold , according to dw 's peter philipp . it appears that german chancellor angela merkel knows how to deal with the man in the white house .
just how well can be judged by the applause she gets on her visits to washington . the ease with which merkel deals with bush , the chemistry she helps to create between them and the success of the meetings between the two leaders can be judged by the length of these outbursts of appreciation and measured by how many minutes they run over their expected duration . but while the applause can be used as a yardstick to gauge merkel 's growing stature in german-us affairs , the responses to the german chancellor are not just about her own performance and the growing respect for her in the states .
it is not only frau merkel who is on the charm offensive .
president bush wants to win germany and the germans over and bring them into line with his foreign policy . bush turning on his own charm to win over germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush is liking what he 's hearing from germany bush is now willing to appear on german talk shows and give exclusive interviews to tabloids as well as accepting an invitation from merkel to visit her constituency in germany . he has also apparently swallowed the bitter pill of germany 's opposition to the iraq war and has made clumsy attempts at expressing his understanding of why the germans so vehemently opposed the 2003 invasion . for bush , iraq is in the past .
his current preoccupation is iran .
and to make any kind of progress in this situation , bush needs all the support he can get . there is none of that coming from china and russia , about which the us issued a report calling vladimir putin 's country a failing democracy .
this is , however , nothing new in washington 's thinking , and bush still considers putin to be someone he can talk with . talk , maybe , but there is no guarantee that any discussions will be able to persuade putin to take the us-favored stance on iran .
merkel , however , is a different matter - at least in bush 's view .
while russia and china see the perceived anti-iran strategy in the us as an obstacle , berlin appears to be aligned with washington . is berlin ready for the us version of diplomacy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the chancellor ready to fully endorse us foreign policy ?
merkel 's public declarations on this alignment are based on the common desire to solve " the problem " through diplomacy .
however , it has long been accepted that the white house version of diplomacy means that the opposition must give in to the us way of thinking . if this does n't happen - and tehran has given no indication that it is ready to bend to us will - then diplomacy gives way to the use of power . is germany ready to follow the us down this path ?
did bush make a good case to the chancellor regarding this possibility in the privacy of the oval office ?
and if merkel ’ s germany is to follow bush on iran , will it also be prepared to back up us solidarity with israel with action if necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when gerhard schröder declared a similar " unlimited solidarity " with the us after september 11 , 2001 , it alienated some germans .
and this time the consequences could be even more drastic . those who are celebrating a new dawn in german-us relations should look beyond the applause and the reciprocation of praise .
bush 's outstretched arm is unlikely to be an invitation into a strategic partnership but more likely to be an echo of the uncle sam recruiting posters from world war i : " i want you … " peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush : germany plays decisive role in war on terror us president george w. bush has told a german paper that germany plays a decisive role in the war on terrorism and that chancellor angela merkel 's actions on the iranian nuclear issue had been key .

angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .
but the hospitality afforded her may be part of a ruse to lure germany into the us foreign policy fold , according to dw 's peter philipp . it appears that german chancellor angela merkel knows how to deal with the man in the white house .
just how well can be judged by the applause she gets on her visits to washington . the ease with which merkel deals with bush , the chemistry she helps to create between them and the success of the meetings between the two leaders can be judged by the length of these outbursts of appreciation and measured by how many minutes they run over their expected duration . but while the applause can be used as a yardstick to gauge merkel 's growing stature in german-us affairs , the responses to the german chancellor are not just about her own performance and the growing respect for her in the states .
it is not only frau merkel who is on the charm offensive .
president bush wants to win germany and the germans over and bring them into line with his foreign policy . bush turning on his own charm to win over germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush is liking what he 's hearing from germany bush is now willing to appear on german talk shows and give exclusive interviews to tabloids as well as accepting an invitation from merkel to visit her constituency in germany . he has also apparently swallowed the bitter pill of germany 's opposition to the iraq war and has made clumsy attempts at expressing his understanding of why the germans so vehemently opposed the 2003 invasion . for bush , iraq is in the past .
his current preoccupation is iran .
and to make any kind of progress in this situation , bush needs all the support he can get . there is none of that coming from china and russia , about which the us issued a report calling vladimir putin 's country a failing democracy .
this is , however , nothing new in washington 's thinking , and bush still considers putin to be someone he can talk with . talk , maybe , but there is no guarantee that any discussions will be able to persuade putin to take the us-favored stance on iran .
merkel , however , is a different matter - at least in bush 's view .
while russia and china see the perceived anti-iran strategy in the us as an obstacle , berlin appears to be aligned with washington . is berlin ready for the us version of diplomacy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the chancellor ready to fully endorse us foreign policy ?
merkel 's public declarations on this alignment are based on the common desire to solve " the problem " through diplomacy .
however , it has long been accepted that the white house version of diplomacy means that the opposition must give in to the us way of thinking . if this does n't happen - and tehran has given no indication that it is ready to bend to us will - then diplomacy gives way to the use of power . is germany ready to follow the us down this path ?
did bush make a good case to the chancellor regarding this possibility in the privacy of the oval office ?
and if merkel ’ s germany is to follow bush on iran , will it also be prepared to back up us solidarity with israel with action if necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when gerhard schröder declared a similar " unlimited solidarity " with the us after september 11 , 2001 , it alienated some germans .
and this time the consequences could be even more drastic . those who are celebrating a new dawn in german-us relations should look beyond the applause and the reciprocation of praise .

who 's to blame ?
the parents or the school system ?
or both ? politicians of all stripes agree on one thing : the equally gifted child from a working class immigrant background should have the same chance to enter university as the son of a dentist .
since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .

in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with learning difficulties may not get the support they need in school " there are so many pupils from families who offer no support whatsoever .
so many parents could n't care less , " said barbara brüse , a primary school teacher in bonn who has spent decades teaching immigrant children . parents can even be counterproductive when faced with a bright child .
only 36 percent of migrant children who have the smarts to attend gymnasium do so , according to heinz-peter meidinger .

angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .
but the hospitality afforded her may be part of a ruse to lure germany into the us foreign policy fold , according to dw 's peter philipp . it appears that german chancellor angela merkel knows how to deal with the man in the white house .
just how well can be judged by the applause she gets on her visits to washington . the ease with which merkel deals with bush , the chemistry she helps to create between them and the success of the meetings between the two leaders can be judged by the length of these outbursts of appreciation and measured by how many minutes they run over their expected duration . but while the applause can be used as a yardstick to gauge merkel 's growing stature in german-us affairs , the responses to the german chancellor are not just about her own performance and the growing respect for her in the states .
it is not only frau merkel who is on the charm offensive .
president bush wants to win germany and the germans over and bring them into line with his foreign policy . bush turning on his own charm to win over germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush is liking what he 's hearing from germany bush is now willing to appear on german talk shows and give exclusive interviews to tabloids as well as accepting an invitation from merkel to visit her constituency in germany . he has also apparently swallowed the bitter pill of germany 's opposition to the iraq war and has made clumsy attempts at expressing his understanding of why the germans so vehemently opposed the 2003 invasion . for bush , iraq is in the past .
his current preoccupation is iran .
and to make any kind of progress in this situation , bush needs all the support he can get . there is none of that coming from china and russia , about which the us issued a report calling vladimir putin 's country a failing democracy .
this is , however , nothing new in washington 's thinking , and bush still considers putin to be someone he can talk with . talk , maybe , but there is no guarantee that any discussions will be able to persuade putin to take the us-favored stance on iran .
merkel , however , is a different matter - at least in bush 's view .
while russia and china see the perceived anti-iran strategy in the us as an obstacle , berlin appears to be aligned with washington . is berlin ready for the us version of diplomacy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the chancellor ready to fully endorse us foreign policy ?
merkel 's public declarations on this alignment are based on the common desire to solve " the problem " through diplomacy .
however , it has long been accepted that the white house version of diplomacy means that the opposition must give in to the us way of thinking . if this does n't happen - and tehran has given no indication that it is ready to bend to us will - then diplomacy gives way to the use of power . is germany ready to follow the us down this path ?
did bush make a good case to the chancellor regarding this possibility in the privacy of the oval office ?
and if merkel ’ s germany is to follow bush on iran , will it also be prepared to back up us solidarity with israel with action if necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when gerhard schröder declared a similar " unlimited solidarity " with the us after september 11 , 2001 , it alienated some germans .
and this time the consequences could be even more drastic . those who are celebrating a new dawn in german-us relations should look beyond the applause and the reciprocation of praise .
bush 's outstretched arm is unlikely to be an invitation into a strategic partnership but more likely to be an echo of the uncle sam recruiting posters from world war i : " i want you … " peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush : germany plays decisive role in war on terror us president george w. bush has told a german paper that germany plays a decisive role in the war on terrorism and that chancellor angela merkel 's actions on the iranian nuclear issue had been key .
-lrb- may 7 , 2006 -rrb- merkel : israel 's right to exist " must never be questioned " speaking at the american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- annual meeting in washington , german chancellor angela merkel denounced iran and the palestinian militant group hamas for questioning israel 's right to exist .

with praise for another record-breaking season still ringing in their ears , bayern munich 's hierarchy begin to plan for another season of dominance . bayern 's 1-1 draw with kaiserslautern on saturday coupled with sv hamburg 's 4-2 loss against hertha berlin helped the club to a 20th domestic title adding to their cup triumph over eintracht frankfurt . the title win gave the bavarian giants another record : the first team to win a league and cup double in successive seasons . " it is great to wrap up the title with a week to go , " said bayern munich coach felix magath .
" to defend the double is unique and the team has been exceptional .
we can all be very proud of our achievement and there will be some celebrations tonight for sure . " magath arrived from vfb stuttgart in july 2004 and has lifted back-to-back doubles in his first two seasons . " full credit to felix -lrb- magath -rrb- .
he has won two league and cup doubles in a row .
that is mightily impressive , " said general manager uli hoeness . bayern were far from convincing against lowly kaiserslautern but captain oliver kahn saluted his team for winning a sixth title in eight seasons .
" kaiserslautern made it difficult but we have a lot of experience in title battles and used it , " said the german international goalkeeper . " we have dominated the league this season and deserve to win the title .
you need to come up with the big points at the right time and we did that . " closest rivals gracious in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas ottl squeezes in the title-winning goal sv hamburg were bayern 's main challengers this season but their manager thomas doll admitted the best team had won .
" congratulations to bayern on their title win , " doll said .
" they were the best team and deserved to finish top . " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf , who led the club to the title in 2004 , also saluted bayern 's achievements .

growth was forecast to ease back slightly to 2.2 percent next year . " both the eu and the euro area are expected to grow markedly stronger this year , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . european economies were reaping the benefits this year of firming domestic and foreign demand , which encouraged companies to make investments even though rising interest rates were making borrowing more expensive . the commission said in the report containing its forecasts that " investment is set to continue growing at a rapid pace underpinned by optimistic business sentiment , a favorable profit outlook and the increased need for replacement investment .

following a rate of 2.2 percent in 2005 , euro-zone inflation was forecast to remain at 2.2 percent this year and next . however , the commission said that oil prices represented the " biggest near-term risk " to european economies .
" the very low spare capacities make markets extremely vulnerable to actual and potential supply disruptions , " the commission said . because of market volatility , forecasts that oil would average $ 68.9 per barrel for 2006 and $ 71 per barrel for 2007 were subject to change , it added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economy gathers steam , institutes revise forecast german economic performance is predicted to grow by 1.8 percent in 2006 , the highest rate in six years , the country 's six leading economic institutes said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.05.2006 grand coalition debates domestic use of bundeswehr großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers on german turf are a contested world cup issue the german government failed to agree on german military involvement in world cup security following a meeting monday .
time is running out to make the constitutional changes necessary for deployment next month . while the christian democrats still want to see the german constitution changed to allow for german troops to be used as an internal security force , the social democrats are vehemently against the plans .
opposition parties also disagree with constitutional changes . spd secretary general hubertus heil said on monday : " we want a strict division between internal and external security forces , " he said .
he added , however , that the spd was open to discussions concerning air and marine safety . altering the definition of a security threat the cdu 's deputy parliamentary floor leader , wolfgang bosbach , said that changes must be made to the constitution so that german troops could be used to defend the public from possible acts of terrorism within the country . " a country 's security must be defined differently today than during the time of the cold war , especially since internal and external security can no longer be so strictly divided , " bosbach told the netzeitung online newspaper . spd defense expert rainer arnold rejected the use of german forces domestically and said the cdu had no chance of gaining a two-thirds majority in the bundestag to change the constitution .
" we tackle terrorist threats and attacks with political means , " he said . opposition warns of a militarization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops may just be transporting medical supplies during the soccer tournament the opposition parties - the liberal fdp , the greens and the left party - are likewise against the german army , the bundeswehr , aiding police forces within german borders .
the parties warned of a " militarization " of internal security forces . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army protects the country outside its borders . the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important given the role the military played in acts of political suppression during adolf hitler 's dictatorship during the last century . defense minister franz josef jung and interior minister wolfgang schäuble said they have made up to 7,000 soldiers available to help during the soccer world cup in june .
the soldiers are only supposed to provide medical , transport and logistical support , and serve as specialists for dealing with nuclear , chemical or biological attacks .

who 's to blame ?
the parents or the school system ?
or both ? politicians of all stripes agree on one thing : the equally gifted child from a working class immigrant background should have the same chance to enter university as the son of a dentist .
since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration issues are n't the only problems german schools have " the educational system is not the cause of problems , but reflects society as a whole .
in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with learning difficulties may not get the support they need in school " there are so many pupils from families who offer no support whatsoever .
so many parents could n't care less , " said barbara brüse , a primary school teacher in bonn who has spent decades teaching immigrant children . parents can even be counterproductive when faced with a bright child .
only 36 percent of migrant children who have the smarts to attend gymnasium do so , according to heinz-peter meidinger .

with praise for another record-breaking season still ringing in their ears , bayern munich 's hierarchy begin to plan for another season of dominance . bayern 's 1-1 draw with kaiserslautern on saturday coupled with sv hamburg 's 4-2 loss against hertha berlin helped the club to a 20th domestic title adding to their cup triumph over eintracht frankfurt . the title win gave the bavarian giants another record : the first team to win a league and cup double in successive seasons . " it is great to wrap up the title with a week to go , " said bayern munich coach felix magath .
" to defend the double is unique and the team has been exceptional .
we can all be very proud of our achievement and there will be some celebrations tonight for sure . " magath arrived from vfb stuttgart in july 2004 and has lifted back-to-back doubles in his first two seasons . " full credit to felix -lrb- magath -rrb- .
he has won two league and cup doubles in a row .
that is mightily impressive , " said general manager uli hoeness . bayern were far from convincing against lowly kaiserslautern but captain oliver kahn saluted his team for winning a sixth title in eight seasons .
" kaiserslautern made it difficult but we have a lot of experience in title battles and used it , " said the german international goalkeeper . " we have dominated the league this season and deserve to win the title .
you need to come up with the big points at the right time and we did that . " closest rivals gracious in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas ottl squeezes in the title-winning goal sv hamburg were bayern 's main challengers this season but their manager thomas doll admitted the best team had won .
" congratulations to bayern on their title win , " doll said .
" they were the best team and deserved to finish top . " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf , who led the club to the title in 2004 , also saluted bayern 's achievements .
" i offer my compliments to bayern .
they were incredibly consistent all season and that is the difference , " said schaaf . former bayern star mario basler congratulated his ex-club - where he won three bundesliga titles - but admitted he was hoping for some stronger competition in the future .
" well done to bayern but to be honest it is getting a bit boring now , " basler said . bayern have won 20 domestic titles with fc nuremberg the next best on nine although their last triumph came way back in 1968 . bayern oils the revolving door for summer sales for bayern to win their 21st title next season , there will have to be a change of personnel as a number of senior players - most notably the chelsea-bound michael ballack - are considering ending their association with the record-breaking bundesliga champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even physical restraint is unlikely to stop podolski leaving while speculation is rife about those who will be on their way out , one who seems destined to be on his way in is fc cologne striker lukas podolski . the 20-year-old international forward is regarded as one of germany 's best young players and since his current club are due to be relegated at the end of this season , it seems most likely that he will continue his career in the top flight by joining the powerful bavarians for the next campaign . " we 'll carry out talks with a view to getting him by july 1 , " bayern manager uli hoeness told reporters in cologne .
according to hoeness , a deal with podolski 's agent for the player was " as good as agreed " although bayern have yet to speak to cologne . prince poldi and van buyten targeted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buyten could be saying his farewells to hamburg another addition could be rivals sv hamburg 's inspirational captain daniel van buyten .
" he has let it be known that he wants to come to us , " hoeness said of the 28-year-old belgian centre-back .
" now he has to discuss it with hamburg . " but whoever comes in at the allianz arena , it will be very hard to fill the void left by the expected departure of ballack , germany 's one true world star .
ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .
his association with the club has helped the one outstanding german team command a higher profile on the global soccer stage . ballack defection a sign of bayern waning power ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack lured by chelsea 's money and future success ?
however , his anticipated loss to the english champions will expose bayern 's shortcomings both on and off the pitch where richer and potentially more successful clubs can swoop for their players in the same way as bayern feed of their rivals in the domestic transfer market . off the pitch , even if podolski and van buyten come , the bavarians will still need to find someone who can play such an effective all-round game in midfield and bring that star quality to the team . hoeness believes that man will be julio dos santos , the 22-year-old paraguay midfielder who joined bayern in january but who has yet to make his bundesliga debut .
" he 's going to have a big impact , " hoeness said . in the bundesliga , that may be true .
but the real question for a club which craves european success as much as bayern is : can he be the new michael ballack ?
the most likely answer to that is that you can not replace the irreplaceable . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern win 20th german league title in kaiserslautern draw one week after winning the german cup , bayern munich also laid claim to the german championship in the season 's penultimate week on saturday and became the first team to achieve the double victory two years in a row .

and just like the sheriff of nottingham in the legend of sherwood forest 's most famous outlaw , the hamburg police are at a loss when it comes to stopping them . the group , which calls itself " hamburg umsonst " - loosely translated as hamburg without charge , has apparently graduated from handing out flyers with tips on how to forge cinema tickets and travel illegally on public transport to raiding the swankiest stores and delicatessens before distributing their swag to the city 's poor . their most high profile job to date came last week .
dressed in an array of comic book hero costumes , the gang raided a well-to-do eatery in the north german port city last friday during work hours and absconded with a large amount of fine food - after posing for a publicity photograph with bemused staff .
hamburg cops called to the crime scene drew a blank despite deploying 14 patrol cars and a police helicopter . according to eye witnesses , the " hamburg umsonst " raiding party consisted of around 30 people who apparently knew what they were doing when it came to fancy eats and drinks .

" it is great to wrap up the title with a week to go , " said bayern munich coach felix magath .
" to defend the double is unique and the team has been exceptional .
we can all be very proud of our achievement and there will be some celebrations tonight for sure . " magath arrived from vfb stuttgart in july 2004 and has lifted back-to-back doubles in his first two seasons . " full credit to felix -lrb- magath -rrb- .
he has won two league and cup doubles in a row .
that is mightily impressive , " said general manager uli hoeness . bayern were far from convincing against lowly kaiserslautern but captain oliver kahn saluted his team for winning a sixth title in eight seasons .
" kaiserslautern made it difficult but we have a lot of experience in title battles and used it , " said the german international goalkeeper . " we have dominated the league this season and deserve to win the title .
you need to come up with the big points at the right time and we did that . " closest rivals gracious in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas ottl squeezes in the title-winning goal sv hamburg were bayern 's main challengers this season but their manager thomas doll admitted the best team had won .

" i offer my compliments to bayern .
they were incredibly consistent all season and that is the difference , " said schaaf . former bayern star mario basler congratulated his ex-club - where he won three bundesliga titles - but admitted he was hoping for some stronger competition in the future .
" well done to bayern but to be honest it is getting a bit boring now , " basler said . bayern have won 20 domestic titles with fc nuremberg the next best on nine although their last triumph came way back in 1968 . bayern oils the revolving door for summer sales for bayern to win their 21st title next season , there will have to be a change of personnel as a number of senior players - most notably the chelsea-bound michael ballack - are considering ending their association with the record-breaking bundesliga champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even physical restraint is unlikely to stop podolski leaving while speculation is rife about those who will be on their way out , one who seems destined to be on his way in is fc cologne striker lukas podolski . the 20-year-old international forward is regarded as one of germany 's best young players and since his current club are due to be relegated at the end of this season , it seems most likely that he will continue his career in the top flight by joining the powerful bavarians for the next campaign .

" now he has to discuss it with hamburg . " but whoever comes in at the allianz arena , it will be very hard to fill the void left by the expected departure of ballack , germany 's one true world star .
ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .

however , his anticipated loss to the english champions will expose bayern 's shortcomings both on and off the pitch where richer and potentially more successful clubs can swoop for their players in the same way as bayern feed of their rivals in the domestic transfer market . off the pitch , even if podolski and van buyten come , the bavarians will still need to find someone who can play such an effective all-round game in midfield and bring that star quality to the team . hoeness believes that man will be julio dos santos , the 22-year-old paraguay midfielder who joined bayern in january but who has yet to make his bundesliga debut .
" he 's going to have a big impact , " hoeness said . in the bundesliga , that may be true .

" we 'll carry out talks with a view to getting him by july 1 , " bayern manager uli hoeness told reporters in cologne .
according to hoeness , a deal with podolski 's agent for the player was " as good as agreed " although bayern have yet to speak to cologne . prince poldi and van buyten targeted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buyten could be saying his farewells to hamburg another addition could be rivals sv hamburg 's inspirational captain daniel van buyten .
" he has let it be known that he wants to come to us , " hoeness said of the 28-year-old belgian centre-back .
" now he has to discuss it with hamburg . " but whoever comes in at the allianz arena , it will be very hard to fill the void left by the expected departure of ballack , germany 's one true world star .
ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .
his association with the club has helped the one outstanding german team command a higher profile on the global soccer stage . ballack defection a sign of bayern waning power ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack lured by chelsea 's money and future success ?
however , his anticipated loss to the english champions will expose bayern 's shortcomings both on and off the pitch where richer and potentially more successful clubs can swoop for their players in the same way as bayern feed of their rivals in the domestic transfer market . off the pitch , even if podolski and van buyten come , the bavarians will still need to find someone who can play such an effective all-round game in midfield and bring that star quality to the team . hoeness believes that man will be julio dos santos , the 22-year-old paraguay midfielder who joined bayern in january but who has yet to make his bundesliga debut .
" he 's going to have a big impact , " hoeness said . in the bundesliga , that may be true .
but the real question for a club which craves european success as much as bayern is : can he be the new michael ballack ?
the most likely answer to that is that you can not replace the irreplaceable . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern win 20th german league title in kaiserslautern draw one week after winning the german cup , bayern munich also laid claim to the german championship in the season 's penultimate week on saturday and became the first team to achieve the double victory two years in a row .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.05.2006 in germany , veiled students stir up uniform debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one potsdam school introduced a dress code in january a debate over whether to mandate school uniforms in germany broke out after two muslim girls were suspended from school in bonn for coming veiled from head to toe in a traditional opaque garb known as a burka . over the weekend , german justice minister brigitte zypries spoke out in favor of introducing school uniforms , unleashing a storm of opinion from commentators and politicians across the country . the debate broke out anew after two 18-year-old muslim girls came to their high school in bonn dressed in traditional burkas - veils that covered them entirely , except for a small mesh slit at the eyes .
the girls ' actions were generally read as a political statement , and the pair was suspended from school .
the burka became well known in the west after it became mandatory garb for afghan women under the reactionary taliban regime . in an interview with the welt on sonntag newspaper about whether veiled pupils should be allowed to attend class in german high schools , zypries said " a simple solution to end the conflict would be having all students , male or female , wear uniforms to school .
that would not only get rid of burkas , but also clear up problems of social inequality " that get lived out through clothing . zypries warned about increasing resentment against foreigners in the schools , in part on religious grounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people do n't want to see burkas in german schools but a cry of opposition went out almost immediately .
the president of the german teachers ' association , josef kraus , called zypries " incredibly naive " to think religious and social discrimination could be reduced by introducing uniforms .
moreover , germany has a " problematic tradition " when it comes to school uniforms , kraus told netzeitung internet portal . uniforms in public institutions still call up the group mentality of the nazi era in germany . despite this , there have been occasional , though relatively isolated , attempts to introduce uniforms in german schools .
recently , two schools in the berlin district of spandau considered switching to school uniforms . advocates say uniforms do away with " brand envy " and reduce the chances of children from poorer families being ostracized because they can not afford the latest fashions .
and , they say , uniforms foster the feeling of being part of a group , and can help students identify with and even have pride in their school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries but up to now , the conference of education ministers that decide on national school policies , called the kmk , has come out against school uniforms .
they , too , cite historical reasons dating back to wwii , with the memories of uniforms worn by the hitler youth still too fresh in the public mind . on top of that , the conference has said , any general uniform rule would raise questions about how far the government can encroach on the personal liberties of students and parents . green opposition zypries ' remarks also met with strong criticism from germany 's green party , which has long championed a multicultural german society .
krista sager , a senior green party member , said the introduction of school uniforms would be an unacceptable interference by the state in religious affairs . " we certainly do n't need solutions imposed by the government .
what we need are individual solutions by the schools themselves that respect the situation on the ground and notably the religious freedom of pupils .
the introduction of school uniforms is generally no longer up to date and would be rejected by current generations of school students . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wearing school uniforms does n't appear to make these students - in australia - unhappy in europe , great britain is known as the nation that continues to impose uniforms on students .
but a spokesperson for zypries said the minister made it clear she was not talking introducing british-style uniforms in germany .
it would be more of a case of students wearing unified pants , t-shirts , and sweatshirts . ulrich stahnke , headmaster of the school in bonn where the outcry began , called the debate about the introduction of school uniforms counterproductive . " it 's important to understand that solutions can only be found in cooperation with immigrant communities .
decisions made by religious outsiders like us are not accepted by muslims .
but at my school it 's now important to make clear to them that we can not accept the burka . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do clothes make the student ?
only a handful of german schools have uniforms , but several are experimenting with the idea , hoping they can encourage reduced competition among students for the latest designer labels .

after the match , they 're all going to need a place to sleep that leaves enough euros in their pocket for a celebratory dinner . the average price for accommodation during the world cup is 190 euros -lrb- $ 241 -rrb- per night - including everything from a youth hostel dorm room to a multi-star hotel suite , according to the fifa world cup accommodation services .
that 's a price some fans ca n't afford , according to ergin iyilikci , spokesperson for immobilienscout24 , an online real estate agent that has set up a special web site for people looking to rooms during the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even they will tire out eventually " the average hotel rates can make for a pricey night , " he said , explaining why young people and families are especially interested in internet sites where they have a chance to stay in the homes of other soccer fans at more affordable rates or free of charge . even for those willing to pay hotel prices , it is likely that there will not be enough rooms available , according nikola günther , who runs another site connecting tired world cup fans with empty beds . dema n d expected to i n crease i n may a n d ju n e " as soon as the decision was made that the world cup would take place in germany , we realized the number of hotel beds would not be enough , " günther said , adding that the site 's average price is between 20 euros and 40 euros per night . the more than 15,000 housing ads , including everything from a spare couch in the living room , to entire apartments and even a multi-room villa , currently outstrip demand , but that 's expected to change as the cup approaches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spare sofa is all some soccer fans are looking for the lists of accommodation are free to people looking for a place to stay , some , however , charge potential hosts as a way of filtering jokers registering their neighbor 's house from serious offers .
hosts are given free reign in determining how much to charge guests . " we 're convinced supply and demand will keep the prices under control , " iyilikci said .
" people who want 500 euros a night wo n't find anyone interested in their place . " rooms cheaper , more perso n al i n host 's home many of the people offering to put up a stranded soccer fan or two , like munich 's gerhard schubert , are n't asking for any payment at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many desperate soccer fans could squeeze into the typical living room ?
" i would much rather stay somewhere more personal than a hotel when i travel and thought i could give the same chance to someone else , " said the 43-year-old soccer fan , who is offering to pull out the sofa-bed in his guest room free of charge .
" i know how expensive munich can be . " andreas schlüter , 27 , said he and his roommate thought offering their hamburg apartment 's extra room to soccer fans was a great idea . " the world cup is called ' a time to make friends , ' and i think that should be brought to life , " he said , adding that he is n't worried about sharing his apartment with hooligans .
" i think only open people with good intentions take part in things like this . " just over half of germans are willing to take the world cup motto to heart by housing fans , according to a study commissioned by immobilenscout24 . fa n s make good city guides for other fa n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans enjoy each other 's company - especially after the game the types of personal exchanges that take place when fans from different countries also show that fans can be friends and rivals at the same time , according to marc bialojahn of ei n dach für fa n s -lrb- a roof for friends -rrb- . " for 90 minutes a healthy rivalry dominates everything - that 's good because that 's what makes soccer great , " he said .
" then you can talk reasonably to each other and go out and have a beer together . " an advantage of staying with a fellow fan instead of in generic hotel room is that soccer fans tend to know where the city 's best bars , restaurants and places to watch the game are , bialojahn added . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a woman 's place is in the stadium soccer games have always been a predominantly male bastion in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education tuition fees face uphill battle in germany study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch private universities take hold in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative germany -pipe- 08.05.2006 german schools : creating social division or reflecting it ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say germany 's educational system is far from egalitarian chancellor merkel wants to hold a high-level integration summit after last month 's crisis at a berlin school whose pupils are mainly from immigrant families .
who 's to blame ?
the parents or the school system ?
or both ? politicians of all stripes agree on one thing : the equally gifted child from a working class immigrant background should have the same chance to enter university as the son of a dentist .
since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration issues are n't the only problems german schools have " the educational system is not the cause of problems , but reflects society as a whole .
in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with learning difficulties may not get the support they need in school " there are so many pupils from families who offer no support whatsoever .
so many parents could n't care less , " said barbara brüse , a primary school teacher in bonn who has spent decades teaching immigrant children . parents can even be counterproductive when faced with a bright child .
only 36 percent of migrant children who have the smarts to attend gymnasium do so , according to heinz-peter meidinger .
" there is resistance to sending girls in particular , because the attitude is : what does she need an education for ? " is a good education so unimportant to migrant families ?
" our educational system should have the ambition to change those values , " concluded andreas schleicher . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government planning integration summit in an attempt to develop a new integration concept , the german government will organize a summit to address a wide range of issues surrounding immigrants and their families .

and just like robin hood and his men , a gang of hamburg activists are proving difficult to catch despite the fact they dress as superheroes when they raid swanky stores . a bunch of egalitarian criminals who go by such names as " spider mum " and " santa guevara " are being referred to as modern-day germany 's version of robin hood and his merry men .
and just like the sheriff of nottingham in the legend of sherwood forest 's most famous outlaw , the hamburg police are at a loss when it comes to stopping them . the group , which calls itself " hamburg umsonst " - loosely translated as hamburg without charge , has apparently graduated from handing out flyers with tips on how to forge cinema tickets and travel illegally on public transport to raiding the swankiest stores and delicatessens before distributing their swag to the city 's poor . their most high profile job to date came last week .
dressed in an array of comic book hero costumes , the gang raided a well-to-do eatery in the north german port city last friday during work hours and absconded with a large amount of fine food - after posing for a publicity photograph with bemused staff .
hamburg cops called to the crime scene drew a blank despite deploying 14 patrol cars and a police helicopter . according to eye witnesses , the " hamburg umsonst " raiding party consisted of around 30 people who apparently knew what they were doing when it came to fancy eats and drinks .
the everyday shoplifter will probably not take the time to savor the array of produce on hand before sticking a box of valrhona chocolates down their pants .

while carrying out their raids in order to support the one-euro jobbers , exploited employees and those on benefits , the gang have been unable to resist the sating of the ego . in what could eventually be their undoing , the caped food raiders have shown a penchant for leaving notes at the scene of their crimes which carry statements such as : " without the abilities of a superhero , survival is impossible in the town of the millionaires .

and just like robin hood and his men , a gang of hamburg activists are proving difficult to catch despite the fact they dress as superheroes when they raid swanky stores . a bunch of egalitarian criminals who go by such names as " spider mum " and " santa guevara " are being referred to as modern-day germany 's version of robin hood and his merry men .
and just like the sheriff of nottingham in the legend of sherwood forest 's most famous outlaw , the hamburg police are at a loss when it comes to stopping them . the group , which calls itself " hamburg umsonst " - loosely translated as hamburg without charge , has apparently graduated from handing out flyers with tips on how to forge cinema tickets and travel illegally on public transport to raiding the swankiest stores and delicatessens before distributing their swag to the city 's poor . their most high profile job to date came last week .
dressed in an array of comic book hero costumes , the gang raided a well-to-do eatery in the north german port city last friday during work hours and absconded with a large amount of fine food - after posing for a publicity photograph with bemused staff .
hamburg cops called to the crime scene drew a blank despite deploying 14 patrol cars and a police helicopter . according to eye witnesses , the " hamburg umsonst " raiding party consisted of around 30 people who apparently knew what they were doing when it came to fancy eats and drinks .
the everyday shoplifter will probably not take the time to savor the array of produce on hand before sticking a box of valrhona chocolates down their pants .
it soon became obvious - these guys were pros . cops ca n't catch connoisseur crooks in costumes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gang 's get-away plan left the cops trailing behind the hamburg cops have little to go on except that the gang has a social conscience , know the difference between corned beef and kobe veal and have a seemingly unlimited supply of fancy dress costumes . but even the best laid plans of criminal masterminds have the odd weak spot .
while carrying out their raids in order to support the one-euro jobbers , exploited employees and those on benefits , the gang have been unable to resist the sating of the ego . in what could eventually be their undoing , the caped food raiders have shown a penchant for leaving notes at the scene of their crimes which carry statements such as : " without the abilities of a superhero , survival is impossible in the town of the millionaires . " until the police get a break , upmarket shopkeepers in hamburg are advised to keep their doors closed to anyone wearing spandex tights and a mexican wrestling mask . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de laughable law breakers germany has its fair share of unusual and sometimes inept law breakers .

time is running out to make the constitutional changes necessary for deployment next month . while the christian democrats still want to see the german constitution changed to allow for german troops to be used as an internal security force , the social democrats are vehemently against the plans .
opposition parties also disagree with constitutional changes . spd secretary general hubertus heil said on monday : " we want a strict division between internal and external security forces , " he said .
he added , however , that the spd was open to discussions concerning air and marine safety . altering the definition of a security threat the cdu 's deputy parliamentary floor leader , wolfgang bosbach , said that changes must be made to the constitution so that german troops could be used to defend the public from possible acts of terrorism within the country . " a country 's security must be defined differently today than during the time of the cold war , especially since internal and external security can no longer be so strictly divided , " bosbach told the netzeitung online newspaper . spd defense expert rainer arnold rejected the use of german forces domestically and said the cdu had no chance of gaining a two-thirds majority in the bundestag to change the constitution .

the soldiers are only supposed to provide medical , transport and logistical support , and serve as specialists for dealing with nuclear , chemical or biological attacks .
defense ministry officals say such a mission would not infringe on the constitutional law preventing the bundeswehr from domestic deployment . schäuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , is eager to relieve pressure on police by using troops to secure venues . the german constitution forbids the use of the military within the nation 's borders unless there is a special crisis or catastrophe . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

after the match , they 're all going to need a place to sleep that leaves enough euros in their pocket for a celebratory dinner . the average price for accommodation during the world cup is 190 euros -lrb- $ 241 -rrb- per night - including everything from a youth hostel dorm room to a multi-star hotel suite , according to the fifa world cup accommodation services .
that 's a price some fans ca n't afford , according to ergin iyilikci , spokesperson for immobilienscout24 , an online real estate agent that has set up a special web site for people looking to rooms during the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even they will tire out eventually " the average hotel rates can make for a pricey night , " he said , explaining why young people and families are especially interested in internet sites where they have a chance to stay in the homes of other soccer fans at more affordable rates or free of charge . even for those willing to pay hotel prices , it is likely that there will not be enough rooms available , according nikola günther , who runs another site connecting tired world cup fans with empty beds . dema n d expected to i n crease i n may a n d ju n e " as soon as the decision was made that the world cup would take place in germany , we realized the number of hotel beds would not be enough , " günther said , adding that the site 's average price is between 20 euros and 40 euros per night . the more than 15,000 housing ads , including everything from a spare couch in the living room , to entire apartments and even a multi-room villa , currently outstrip demand , but that 's expected to change as the cup approaches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spare sofa is all some soccer fans are looking for the lists of accommodation are free to people looking for a place to stay , some , however , charge potential hosts as a way of filtering jokers registering their neighbor 's house from serious offers .
hosts are given free reign in determining how much to charge guests . " we 're convinced supply and demand will keep the prices under control , " iyilikci said .
" people who want 500 euros a night wo n't find anyone interested in their place . " rooms cheaper , more perso n al i n host 's home many of the people offering to put up a stranded soccer fan or two , like munich 's gerhard schubert , are n't asking for any payment at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many desperate soccer fans could squeeze into the typical living room ?
" i would much rather stay somewhere more personal than a hotel when i travel and thought i could give the same chance to someone else , " said the 43-year-old soccer fan , who is offering to pull out the sofa-bed in his guest room free of charge .
" i know how expensive munich can be . " andreas schlüter , 27 , said he and his roommate thought offering their hamburg apartment 's extra room to soccer fans was a great idea . " the world cup is called ' a time to make friends , ' and i think that should be brought to life , " he said , adding that he is n't worried about sharing his apartment with hooligans .
" i think only open people with good intentions take part in things like this .

" for 90 minutes a healthy rivalry dominates everything - that 's good because that 's what makes soccer great , " he said .
" then you can talk reasonably to each other and go out and have a beer together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.05.2006 opinion : beware of the crocodile 's smile großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is angela merkel 's germany being flattered into a dangerous relationship with the us ?
angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .
but the hospitality afforded her may be part of a ruse to lure germany into the us foreign policy fold , according to dw 's peter philipp . it appears that german chancellor angela merkel knows how to deal with the man in the white house .
just how well can be judged by the applause she gets on her visits to washington . the ease with which merkel deals with bush , the chemistry she helps to create between them and the success of the meetings between the two leaders can be judged by the length of these outbursts of appreciation and measured by how many minutes they run over their expected duration . but while the applause can be used as a yardstick to gauge merkel 's growing stature in german-us affairs , the responses to the german chancellor are not just about her own performance and the growing respect for her in the states .
it is not only frau merkel who is on the charm offensive .
president bush wants to win germany and the germans over and bring them into line with his foreign policy . bush turning on his own charm to win over germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush is liking what he 's hearing from germany bush is now willing to appear on german talk shows and give exclusive interviews to tabloids as well as accepting an invitation from merkel to visit her constituency in germany . he has also apparently swallowed the bitter pill of germany 's opposition to the iraq war and has made clumsy attempts at expressing his understanding of why the germans so vehemently opposed the 2003 invasion . for bush , iraq is in the past .
his current preoccupation is iran .
and to make any kind of progress in this situation , bush needs all the support he can get . there is none of that coming from china and russia , about which the us issued a report calling vladimir putin 's country a failing democracy .
this is , however , nothing new in washington 's thinking , and bush still considers putin to be someone he can talk with . talk , maybe , but there is no guarantee that any discussions will be able to persuade putin to take the us-favored stance on iran .
merkel , however , is a different matter - at least in bush 's view .
while russia and china see the perceived anti-iran strategy in the us as an obstacle , berlin appears to be aligned with washington . is berlin ready for the us version of diplomacy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the chancellor ready to fully endorse us foreign policy ?
merkel 's public declarations on this alignment are based on the common desire to solve " the problem " through diplomacy .
however , it has long been accepted that the white house version of diplomacy means that the opposition must give in to the us way of thinking . if this does n't happen - and tehran has given no indication that it is ready to bend to us will - then diplomacy gives way to the use of power . is germany ready to follow the us down this path ?
did bush make a good case to the chancellor regarding this possibility in the privacy of the oval office ?
and if merkel ’ s germany is to follow bush on iran , will it also be prepared to back up us solidarity with israel with action if necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when gerhard schröder declared a similar " unlimited solidarity " with the us after september 11 , 2001 , it alienated some germans .
and this time the consequences could be even more drastic . those who are celebrating a new dawn in german-us relations should look beyond the applause and the reciprocation of praise .
bush 's outstretched arm is unlikely to be an invitation into a strategic partnership but more likely to be an echo of the uncle sam recruiting posters from world war i : " i want you … " peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush : germany plays decisive role in war on terror us president george w. bush has told a german paper that germany plays a decisive role in the war on terrorism and that chancellor angela merkel 's actions on the iranian nuclear issue had been key .

angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .
but the hospitality afforded her may be part of a ruse to lure germany into the us foreign policy fold , according to dw 's peter philipp . it appears that german chancellor angela merkel knows how to deal with the man in the white house .
just how well can be judged by the applause she gets on her visits to washington . the ease with which merkel deals with bush , the chemistry she helps to create between them and the success of the meetings between the two leaders can be judged by the length of these outbursts of appreciation and measured by how many minutes they run over their expected duration . but while the applause can be used as a yardstick to gauge merkel 's growing stature in german-us affairs , the responses to the german chancellor are not just about her own performance and the growing respect for her in the states .

his current preoccupation is iran .
and to make any kind of progress in this situation , bush needs all the support he can get . there is none of that coming from china and russia , about which the us issued a report calling vladimir putin 's country a failing democracy .
this is , however , nothing new in washington 's thinking , and bush still considers putin to be someone he can talk with . talk , maybe , but there is no guarantee that any discussions will be able to persuade putin to take the us-favored stance on iran .

merkel 's public declarations on this alignment are based on the common desire to solve " the problem " through diplomacy .

the girls ' actions were generally read as a political statement , and the pair was suspended from school .
the burka became well known in the west after it became mandatory garb for afghan women under the reactionary taliban regime . in an interview with the welt on sonntag newspaper about whether veiled pupils should be allowed to attend class in german high schools , zypries said " a simple solution to end the conflict would be having all students , male or female , wear uniforms to school .
that would not only get rid of burkas , but also clear up problems of social inequality " that get lived out through clothing . zypries warned about increasing resentment against foreigners in the schools , in part on religious grounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people do n't want to see burkas in german schools but a cry of opposition went out almost immediately .
the president of the german teachers ' association , josef kraus , called zypries " incredibly naive " to think religious and social discrimination could be reduced by introducing uniforms .
moreover , germany has a " problematic tradition " when it comes to school uniforms , kraus told netzeitung internet portal . uniforms in public institutions still call up the group mentality of the nazi era in germany . despite this , there have been occasional , though relatively isolated , attempts to introduce uniforms in german schools .
recently , two schools in the berlin district of spandau considered switching to school uniforms . advocates say uniforms do away with " brand envy " and reduce the chances of children from poorer families being ostracized because they can not afford the latest fashions .
and , they say , uniforms foster the feeling of being part of a group , and can help students identify with and even have pride in their school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries but up to now , the conference of education ministers that decide on national school policies , called the kmk , has come out against school uniforms .
they , too , cite historical reasons dating back to wwii , with the memories of uniforms worn by the hitler youth still too fresh in the public mind . on top of that , the conference has said , any general uniform rule would raise questions about how far the government can encroach on the personal liberties of students and parents . green opposition zypries ' remarks also met with strong criticism from germany 's green party , which has long championed a multicultural german society .
krista sager , a senior green party member , said the introduction of school uniforms would be an unacceptable interference by the state in religious affairs . " we certainly do n't need solutions imposed by the government .
what we need are individual solutions by the schools themselves that respect the situation on the ground and notably the religious freedom of pupils .
the introduction of school uniforms is generally no longer up to date and would be rejected by current generations of school students . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wearing school uniforms does n't appear to make these students - in australia - unhappy in europe , great britain is known as the nation that continues to impose uniforms on students .
but a spokesperson for zypries said the minister made it clear she was not talking introducing british-style uniforms in germany .
it would be more of a case of students wearing unified pants , t-shirts , and sweatshirts . ulrich stahnke , headmaster of the school in bonn where the outcry began , called the debate about the introduction of school uniforms counterproductive . " it 's important to understand that solutions can only be found in cooperation with immigrant communities .
decisions made by religious outsiders like us are not accepted by muslims .
but at my school it 's now important to make clear to them that we can not accept the burka . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do clothes make the student ?
only a handful of german schools have uniforms , but several are experimenting with the idea , hoping they can encourage reduced competition among students for the latest designer labels .
critics call it forced conformity .

with praise for another record-breaking season still ringing in their ears , bayern munich 's hierarchy begin to plan for another season of dominance . bayern 's 1-1 draw with kaiserslautern on saturday coupled with sv hamburg 's 4-2 loss against hertha berlin helped the club to a 20th domestic title adding to their cup triumph over eintracht frankfurt . the title win gave the bavarian giants another record : the first team to win a league and cup double in successive seasons . " it is great to wrap up the title with a week to go , " said bayern munich coach felix magath .
" to defend the double is unique and the team has been exceptional .
we can all be very proud of our achievement and there will be some celebrations tonight for sure . " magath arrived from vfb stuttgart in july 2004 and has lifted back-to-back doubles in his first two seasons . " full credit to felix -lrb- magath -rrb- .
he has won two league and cup doubles in a row .
that is mightily impressive , " said general manager uli hoeness . bayern were far from convincing against lowly kaiserslautern but captain oliver kahn saluted his team for winning a sixth title in eight seasons .
" kaiserslautern made it difficult but we have a lot of experience in title battles and used it , " said the german international goalkeeper . " we have dominated the league this season and deserve to win the title .
you need to come up with the big points at the right time and we did that . " closest rivals gracious in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas ottl squeezes in the title-winning goal sv hamburg were bayern 's main challengers this season but their manager thomas doll admitted the best team had won .
" congratulations to bayern on their title win , " doll said .
" they were the best team and deserved to finish top . " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf , who led the club to the title in 2004 , also saluted bayern 's achievements .
" i offer my compliments to bayern .
they were incredibly consistent all season and that is the difference , " said schaaf . former bayern star mario basler congratulated his ex-club - where he won three bundesliga titles - but admitted he was hoping for some stronger competition in the future .
" well done to bayern but to be honest it is getting a bit boring now , " basler said . bayern have won 20 domestic titles with fc nuremberg the next best on nine although their last triumph came way back in 1968 . bayern oils the revolving door for summer sales for bayern to win their 21st title next season , there will have to be a change of personnel as a number of senior players - most notably the chelsea-bound michael ballack - are considering ending their association with the record-breaking bundesliga champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even physical restraint is unlikely to stop podolski leaving while speculation is rife about those who will be on their way out , one who seems destined to be on his way in is fc cologne striker lukas podolski . the 20-year-old international forward is regarded as one of germany 's best young players and since his current club are due to be relegated at the end of this season , it seems most likely that he will continue his career in the top flight by joining the powerful bavarians for the next campaign . " we 'll carry out talks with a view to getting him by july 1 , " bayern manager uli hoeness told reporters in cologne .
according to hoeness , a deal with podolski 's agent for the player was " as good as agreed " although bayern have yet to speak to cologne . prince poldi and van buyten targeted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buyten could be saying his farewells to hamburg another addition could be rivals sv hamburg 's inspirational captain daniel van buyten .
" he has let it be known that he wants to come to us , " hoeness said of the 28-year-old belgian centre-back .
" now he has to discuss it with hamburg . " but whoever comes in at the allianz arena , it will be very hard to fill the void left by the expected departure of ballack , germany 's one true world star .
ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .
his association with the club has helped the one outstanding german team command a higher profile on the global soccer stage . ballack defection a sign of bayern waning power ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack lured by chelsea 's money and future success ?
however , his anticipated loss to the english champions will expose bayern 's shortcomings both on and off the pitch where richer and potentially more successful clubs can swoop for their players in the same way as bayern feed of their rivals in the domestic transfer market . off the pitch , even if podolski and van buyten come , the bavarians will still need to find someone who can play such an effective all-round game in midfield and bring that star quality to the team . hoeness believes that man will be julio dos santos , the 22-year-old paraguay midfielder who joined bayern in january but who has yet to make his bundesliga debut .

with praise for another record-breaking season still ringing in their ears , bayern munich 's hierarchy begin to plan for another season of dominance . bayern 's 1-1 draw with kaiserslautern on saturday coupled with sv hamburg 's 4-2 loss against hertha berlin helped the club to a 20th domestic title adding to their cup triumph over eintracht frankfurt . the title win gave the bavarian giants another record : the first team to win a league and cup double in successive seasons . " it is great to wrap up the title with a week to go , " said bayern munich coach felix magath .
" to defend the double is unique and the team has been exceptional .
we can all be very proud of our achievement and there will be some celebrations tonight for sure . " magath arrived from vfb stuttgart in july 2004 and has lifted back-to-back doubles in his first two seasons . " full credit to felix -lrb- magath -rrb- .
he has won two league and cup doubles in a row .
that is mightily impressive , " said general manager uli hoeness . bayern were far from convincing against lowly kaiserslautern but captain oliver kahn saluted his team for winning a sixth title in eight seasons .
" kaiserslautern made it difficult but we have a lot of experience in title battles and used it , " said the german international goalkeeper . " we have dominated the league this season and deserve to win the title .
you need to come up with the big points at the right time and we did that . " closest rivals gracious in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas ottl squeezes in the title-winning goal sv hamburg were bayern 's main challengers this season but their manager thomas doll admitted the best team had won .

" i offer my compliments to bayern .
they were incredibly consistent all season and that is the difference , " said schaaf . former bayern star mario basler congratulated his ex-club - where he won three bundesliga titles - but admitted he was hoping for some stronger competition in the future .

" he has let it be known that he wants to come to us , " hoeness said of the 28-year-old belgian centre-back .
" now he has to discuss it with hamburg . " but whoever comes in at the allianz arena , it will be very hard to fill the void left by the expected departure of ballack , germany 's one true world star .
ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .
his association with the club has helped the one outstanding german team command a higher profile on the global soccer stage . ballack defection a sign of bayern waning power ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack lured by chelsea 's money and future success ?
however , his anticipated loss to the english champions will expose bayern 's shortcomings both on and off the pitch where richer and potentially more successful clubs can swoop for their players in the same way as bayern feed of their rivals in the domestic transfer market . off the pitch , even if podolski and van buyten come , the bavarians will still need to find someone who can play such an effective all-round game in midfield and bring that star quality to the team . hoeness believes that man will be julio dos santos , the 22-year-old paraguay midfielder who joined bayern in january but who has yet to make his bundesliga debut .

that is mightily impressive , " said general manager uli hoeness . bayern were far from convincing against lowly kaiserslautern but captain oliver kahn saluted his team for winning a sixth title in eight seasons .
" kaiserslautern made it difficult but we have a lot of experience in title battles and used it , " said the german international goalkeeper . " we have dominated the league this season and deserve to win the title .
you need to come up with the big points at the right time and we did that . " closest rivals gracious in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas ottl squeezes in the title-winning goal sv hamburg were bayern 's main challengers this season but their manager thomas doll admitted the best team had won .
" congratulations to bayern on their title win , " doll said .
" they were the best team and deserved to finish top . " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf , who led the club to the title in 2004 , also saluted bayern 's achievements .
" i offer my compliments to bayern .
they were incredibly consistent all season and that is the difference , " said schaaf . former bayern star mario basler congratulated his ex-club - where he won three bundesliga titles - but admitted he was hoping for some stronger competition in the future .
" well done to bayern but to be honest it is getting a bit boring now , " basler said . bayern have won 20 domestic titles with fc nuremberg the next best on nine although their last triumph came way back in 1968 . bayern oils the revolving door for summer sales for bayern to win their 21st title next season , there will have to be a change of personnel as a number of senior players - most notably the chelsea-bound michael ballack - are considering ending their association with the record-breaking bundesliga champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even physical restraint is unlikely to stop podolski leaving while speculation is rife about those who will be on their way out , one who seems destined to be on his way in is fc cologne striker lukas podolski . the 20-year-old international forward is regarded as one of germany 's best young players and since his current club are due to be relegated at the end of this season , it seems most likely that he will continue his career in the top flight by joining the powerful bavarians for the next campaign . " we 'll carry out talks with a view to getting him by july 1 , " bayern manager uli hoeness told reporters in cologne .
according to hoeness , a deal with podolski 's agent for the player was " as good as agreed " although bayern have yet to speak to cologne . prince poldi and van buyten targeted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buyten could be saying his farewells to hamburg another addition could be rivals sv hamburg 's inspirational captain daniel van buyten .
" he has let it be known that he wants to come to us , " hoeness said of the 28-year-old belgian centre-back .
" now he has to discuss it with hamburg . " but whoever comes in at the allianz arena , it will be very hard to fill the void left by the expected departure of ballack , germany 's one true world star .
ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .
his association with the club has helped the one outstanding german team command a higher profile on the global soccer stage . ballack defection a sign of bayern waning power ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack lured by chelsea 's money and future success ?
however , his anticipated loss to the english champions will expose bayern 's shortcomings both on and off the pitch where richer and potentially more successful clubs can swoop for their players in the same way as bayern feed of their rivals in the domestic transfer market . off the pitch , even if podolski and van buyten come , the bavarians will still need to find someone who can play such an effective all-round game in midfield and bring that star quality to the team . hoeness believes that man will be julio dos santos , the 22-year-old paraguay midfielder who joined bayern in january but who has yet to make his bundesliga debut .
" he 's going to have a big impact , " hoeness said . in the bundesliga , that may be true .
but the real question for a club which craves european success as much as bayern is : can he be the new michael ballack ?
the most likely answer to that is that you can not replace the irreplaceable . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern win 20th german league title in kaiserslautern draw one week after winning the german cup , bayern munich also laid claim to the german championship in the season 's penultimate week on saturday and became the first team to achieve the double victory two years in a row .

after the match , they 're all going to need a place to sleep that leaves enough euros in their pocket for a celebratory dinner . the average price for accommodation during the world cup is 190 euros -lrb- $ 241 -rrb- per night - including everything from a youth hostel dorm room to a multi-star hotel suite , according to the fifa world cup accommodation services .
that 's a price some fans ca n't afford , according to ergin iyilikci , spokesperson for immobilienscout24 , an online real estate agent that has set up a special web site for people looking to rooms during the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even they will tire out eventually " the average hotel rates can make for a pricey night , " he said , explaining why young people and families are especially interested in internet sites where they have a chance to stay in the homes of other soccer fans at more affordable rates or free of charge . even for those willing to pay hotel prices , it is likely that there will not be enough rooms available , according nikola günther , who runs another site connecting tired world cup fans with empty beds . dema n d expected to i n crease i n may a n d ju n e " as soon as the decision was made that the world cup would take place in germany , we realized the number of hotel beds would not be enough , " günther said , adding that the site 's average price is between 20 euros and 40 euros per night . the more than 15,000 housing ads , including everything from a spare couch in the living room , to entire apartments and even a multi-room villa , currently outstrip demand , but that 's expected to change as the cup approaches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spare sofa is all some soccer fans are looking for the lists of accommodation are free to people looking for a place to stay , some , however , charge potential hosts as a way of filtering jokers registering their neighbor 's house from serious offers .
hosts are given free reign in determining how much to charge guests . " we 're convinced supply and demand will keep the prices under control , " iyilikci said .
" people who want 500 euros a night wo n't find anyone interested in their place . " rooms cheaper , more perso n al i n host 's home many of the people offering to put up a stranded soccer fan or two , like munich 's gerhard schubert , are n't asking for any payment at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many desperate soccer fans could squeeze into the typical living room ?
" i would much rather stay somewhere more personal than a hotel when i travel and thought i could give the same chance to someone else , " said the 43-year-old soccer fan , who is offering to pull out the sofa-bed in his guest room free of charge .
" i know how expensive munich can be . " andreas schlüter , 27 , said he and his roommate thought offering their hamburg apartment 's extra room to soccer fans was a great idea . " the world cup is called ' a time to make friends , ' and i think that should be brought to life , " he said , adding that he is n't worried about sharing his apartment with hooligans .
" i think only open people with good intentions take part in things like this . " just over half of germans are willing to take the world cup motto to heart by housing fans , according to a study commissioned by immobilenscout24 . fa n s make good city guides for other fa n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans enjoy each other 's company - especially after the game the types of personal exchanges that take place when fans from different countries also show that fans can be friends and rivals at the same time , according to marc bialojahn of ei n dach für fa n s -lrb- a roof for friends -rrb- . " for 90 minutes a healthy rivalry dominates everything - that 's good because that 's what makes soccer great , " he said .
" then you can talk reasonably to each other and go out and have a beer together . " an advantage of staying with a fellow fan instead of in generic hotel room is that soccer fans tend to know where the city 's best bars , restaurants and places to watch the game are , bialojahn added . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a woman 's place is in the stadium soccer games have always been a predominantly male bastion in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.05.2006 opinion : beware of the crocodile 's smile großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is angela merkel 's germany being flattered into a dangerous relationship with the us ?
angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .
but the hospitality afforded her may be part of a ruse to lure germany into the us foreign policy fold , according to dw 's peter philipp . it appears that german chancellor angela merkel knows how to deal with the man in the white house .
just how well can be judged by the applause she gets on her visits to washington . the ease with which merkel deals with bush , the chemistry she helps to create between them and the success of the meetings between the two leaders can be judged by the length of these outbursts of appreciation and measured by how many minutes they run over their expected duration . but while the applause can be used as a yardstick to gauge merkel 's growing stature in german-us affairs , the responses to the german chancellor are not just about her own performance and the growing respect for her in the states .
it is not only frau merkel who is on the charm offensive .
president bush wants to win germany and the germans over and bring them into line with his foreign policy . bush turning on his own charm to win over germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush is liking what he 's hearing from germany bush is now willing to appear on german talk shows and give exclusive interviews to tabloids as well as accepting an invitation from merkel to visit her constituency in germany . he has also apparently swallowed the bitter pill of germany 's opposition to the iraq war and has made clumsy attempts at expressing his understanding of why the germans so vehemently opposed the 2003 invasion . for bush , iraq is in the past .
his current preoccupation is iran .
and to make any kind of progress in this situation , bush needs all the support he can get . there is none of that coming from china and russia , about which the us issued a report calling vladimir putin 's country a failing democracy .
this is , however , nothing new in washington 's thinking , and bush still considers putin to be someone he can talk with . talk , maybe , but there is no guarantee that any discussions will be able to persuade putin to take the us-favored stance on iran .
merkel , however , is a different matter - at least in bush 's view .
while russia and china see the perceived anti-iran strategy in the us as an obstacle , berlin appears to be aligned with washington . is berlin ready for the us version of diplomacy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the chancellor ready to fully endorse us foreign policy ?
merkel 's public declarations on this alignment are based on the common desire to solve " the problem " through diplomacy .
however , it has long been accepted that the white house version of diplomacy means that the opposition must give in to the us way of thinking . if this does n't happen - and tehran has given no indication that it is ready to bend to us will - then diplomacy gives way to the use of power . is germany ready to follow the us down this path ?
did bush make a good case to the chancellor regarding this possibility in the privacy of the oval office ?
and if merkel ’ s germany is to follow bush on iran , will it also be prepared to back up us solidarity with israel with action if necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when gerhard schröder declared a similar " unlimited solidarity " with the us after september 11 , 2001 , it alienated some germans .
and this time the consequences could be even more drastic . those who are celebrating a new dawn in german-us relations should look beyond the applause and the reciprocation of praise .
bush 's outstretched arm is unlikely to be an invitation into a strategic partnership but more likely to be an echo of the uncle sam recruiting posters from world war i : " i want you … " peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush : germany plays decisive role in war on terror us president george w. bush has told a german paper that germany plays a decisive role in the war on terrorism and that chancellor angela merkel 's actions on the iranian nuclear issue had been key .
-lrb- may 7 , 2006 -rrb- merkel : israel 's right to exist " must never be questioned " speaking at the american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- annual meeting in washington , german chancellor angela merkel denounced iran and the palestinian militant group hamas for questioning israel 's right to exist .
-lrb- may 5 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : merkel knows how to be friendly but firm germany 's chancellor has headed to the us for the second time in four months , proving that german-american ties are warmer than they 've been for years .

who 's to blame ?
the parents or the school system ?
or both ? politicians of all stripes agree on one thing : the equally gifted child from a working class immigrant background should have the same chance to enter university as the son of a dentist .
since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration issues are n't the only problems german schools have " the educational system is not the cause of problems , but reflects society as a whole .
in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with learning difficulties may not get the support they need in school " there are so many pupils from families who offer no support whatsoever .
so many parents could n't care less , " said barbara brüse , a primary school teacher in bonn who has spent decades teaching immigrant children . parents can even be counterproductive when faced with a bright child .
only 36 percent of migrant children who have the smarts to attend gymnasium do so , according to heinz-peter meidinger .

" germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .

who 's to blame ?
the parents or the school system ?
or both ? politicians of all stripes agree on one thing : the equally gifted child from a working class immigrant background should have the same chance to enter university as the son of a dentist .
since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .

who 's to blame ?
the parents or the school system ?
or both ? politicians of all stripes agree on one thing : the equally gifted child from a working class immigrant background should have the same chance to enter university as the son of a dentist .
since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration issues are n't the only problems german schools have " the educational system is not the cause of problems , but reflects society as a whole .
in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with learning difficulties may not get the support they need in school " there are so many pupils from families who offer no support whatsoever .
so many parents could n't care less , " said barbara brüse , a primary school teacher in bonn who has spent decades teaching immigrant children . parents can even be counterproductive when faced with a bright child .
only 36 percent of migrant children who have the smarts to attend gymnasium do so , according to heinz-peter meidinger .
" there is resistance to sending girls in particular , because the attitude is : what does she need an education for ? " is a good education so unimportant to migrant families ?

with praise for another record-breaking season still ringing in their ears , bayern munich 's hierarchy begin to plan for another season of dominance . bayern 's 1-1 draw with kaiserslautern on saturday coupled with sv hamburg 's 4-2 loss against hertha berlin helped the club to a 20th domestic title adding to their cup triumph over eintracht frankfurt . the title win gave the bavarian giants another record : the first team to win a league and cup double in successive seasons . " it is great to wrap up the title with a week to go , " said bayern munich coach felix magath .
" to defend the double is unique and the team has been exceptional .
we can all be very proud of our achievement and there will be some celebrations tonight for sure . " magath arrived from vfb stuttgart in july 2004 and has lifted back-to-back doubles in his first two seasons . " full credit to felix -lrb- magath -rrb- .
he has won two league and cup doubles in a row .
that is mightily impressive , " said general manager uli hoeness . bayern were far from convincing against lowly kaiserslautern but captain oliver kahn saluted his team for winning a sixth title in eight seasons .
" kaiserslautern made it difficult but we have a lot of experience in title battles and used it , " said the german international goalkeeper . " we have dominated the league this season and deserve to win the title .
you need to come up with the big points at the right time and we did that . " closest rivals gracious in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas ottl squeezes in the title-winning goal sv hamburg were bayern 's main challengers this season but their manager thomas doll admitted the best team had won .
" congratulations to bayern on their title win , " doll said .
" they were the best team and deserved to finish top . " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf , who led the club to the title in 2004 , also saluted bayern 's achievements .

angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .
but the hospitality afforded her may be part of a ruse to lure germany into the us foreign policy fold , according to dw 's peter philipp . it appears that german chancellor angela merkel knows how to deal with the man in the white house .
just how well can be judged by the applause she gets on her visits to washington . the ease with which merkel deals with bush , the chemistry she helps to create between them and the success of the meetings between the two leaders can be judged by the length of these outbursts of appreciation and measured by how many minutes they run over their expected duration . but while the applause can be used as a yardstick to gauge merkel 's growing stature in german-us affairs , the responses to the german chancellor are not just about her own performance and the growing respect for her in the states .
it is not only frau merkel who is on the charm offensive .
president bush wants to win germany and the germans over and bring them into line with his foreign policy . bush turning on his own charm to win over germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush is liking what he 's hearing from germany bush is now willing to appear on german talk shows and give exclusive interviews to tabloids as well as accepting an invitation from merkel to visit her constituency in germany . he has also apparently swallowed the bitter pill of germany 's opposition to the iraq war and has made clumsy attempts at expressing his understanding of why the germans so vehemently opposed the 2003 invasion . for bush , iraq is in the past .
his current preoccupation is iran .
and to make any kind of progress in this situation , bush needs all the support he can get . there is none of that coming from china and russia , about which the us issued a report calling vladimir putin 's country a failing democracy .
this is , however , nothing new in washington 's thinking , and bush still considers putin to be someone he can talk with . talk , maybe , but there is no guarantee that any discussions will be able to persuade putin to take the us-favored stance on iran .
merkel , however , is a different matter - at least in bush 's view .
while russia and china see the perceived anti-iran strategy in the us as an obstacle , berlin appears to be aligned with washington . is berlin ready for the us version of diplomacy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the chancellor ready to fully endorse us foreign policy ?
merkel 's public declarations on this alignment are based on the common desire to solve " the problem " through diplomacy .
however , it has long been accepted that the white house version of diplomacy means that the opposition must give in to the us way of thinking . if this does n't happen - and tehran has given no indication that it is ready to bend to us will - then diplomacy gives way to the use of power . is germany ready to follow the us down this path ?
did bush make a good case to the chancellor regarding this possibility in the privacy of the oval office ?
and if merkel ’ s germany is to follow bush on iran , will it also be prepared to back up us solidarity with israel with action if necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when gerhard schröder declared a similar " unlimited solidarity " with the us after september 11 , 2001 , it alienated some germans .
and this time the consequences could be even more drastic . those who are celebrating a new dawn in german-us relations should look beyond the applause and the reciprocation of praise .
bush 's outstretched arm is unlikely to be an invitation into a strategic partnership but more likely to be an echo of the uncle sam recruiting posters from world war i : " i want you … " peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush : germany plays decisive role in war on terror us president george w. bush has told a german paper that germany plays a decisive role in the war on terrorism and that chancellor angela merkel 's actions on the iranian nuclear issue had been key .
-lrb- may 7 , 2006 -rrb- merkel : israel 's right to exist " must never be questioned " speaking at the american jewish committee -lrb- ajc -rrb- annual meeting in washington , german chancellor angela merkel denounced iran and the palestinian militant group hamas for questioning israel 's right to exist .
-lrb- may 5 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : merkel knows how to be friendly but firm germany 's chancellor has headed to the us for the second time in four months , proving that german-american ties are warmer than they 've been for years .

with praise for another record-breaking season still ringing in their ears , bayern munich 's hierarchy begin to plan for another season of dominance . bayern 's 1-1 draw with kaiserslautern on saturday coupled with sv hamburg 's 4-2 loss against hertha berlin helped the club to a 20th domestic title adding to their cup triumph over eintracht frankfurt . the title win gave the bavarian giants another record : the first team to win a league and cup double in successive seasons . " it is great to wrap up the title with a week to go , " said bayern munich coach felix magath .
" to defend the double is unique and the team has been exceptional .
we can all be very proud of our achievement and there will be some celebrations tonight for sure . " magath arrived from vfb stuttgart in july 2004 and has lifted back-to-back doubles in his first two seasons . " full credit to felix -lrb- magath -rrb- .
he has won two league and cup doubles in a row .
that is mightily impressive , " said general manager uli hoeness . bayern were far from convincing against lowly kaiserslautern but captain oliver kahn saluted his team for winning a sixth title in eight seasons .
" kaiserslautern made it difficult but we have a lot of experience in title battles and used it , " said the german international goalkeeper . " we have dominated the league this season and deserve to win the title .
you need to come up with the big points at the right time and we did that . " closest rivals gracious in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas ottl squeezes in the title-winning goal sv hamburg were bayern 's main challengers this season but their manager thomas doll admitted the best team had won .
" congratulations to bayern on their title win , " doll said .

the girls ' actions were generally read as a political statement , and the pair was suspended from school .
the burka became well known in the west after it became mandatory garb for afghan women under the reactionary taliban regime . in an interview with the welt on sonntag newspaper about whether veiled pupils should be allowed to attend class in german high schools , zypries said " a simple solution to end the conflict would be having all students , male or female , wear uniforms to school .
that would not only get rid of burkas , but also clear up problems of social inequality " that get lived out through clothing . zypries warned about increasing resentment against foreigners in the schools , in part on religious grounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people do n't want to see burkas in german schools but a cry of opposition went out almost immediately .
the president of the german teachers ' association , josef kraus , called zypries " incredibly naive " to think religious and social discrimination could be reduced by introducing uniforms .
moreover , germany has a " problematic tradition " when it comes to school uniforms , kraus told netzeitung internet portal . uniforms in public institutions still call up the group mentality of the nazi era in germany . despite this , there have been occasional , though relatively isolated , attempts to introduce uniforms in german schools .
recently , two schools in the berlin district of spandau considered switching to school uniforms . advocates say uniforms do away with " brand envy " and reduce the chances of children from poorer families being ostracized because they can not afford the latest fashions .
and , they say , uniforms foster the feeling of being part of a group , and can help students identify with and even have pride in their school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries but up to now , the conference of education ministers that decide on national school policies , called the kmk , has come out against school uniforms .
they , too , cite historical reasons dating back to wwii , with the memories of uniforms worn by the hitler youth still too fresh in the public mind . on top of that , the conference has said , any general uniform rule would raise questions about how far the government can encroach on the personal liberties of students and parents . green opposition zypries ' remarks also met with strong criticism from germany 's green party , which has long championed a multicultural german society .
krista sager , a senior green party member , said the introduction of school uniforms would be an unacceptable interference by the state in religious affairs . " we certainly do n't need solutions imposed by the government .
what we need are individual solutions by the schools themselves that respect the situation on the ground and notably the religious freedom of pupils .
the introduction of school uniforms is generally no longer up to date and would be rejected by current generations of school students . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wearing school uniforms does n't appear to make these students - in australia - unhappy in europe , great britain is known as the nation that continues to impose uniforms on students .
but a spokesperson for zypries said the minister made it clear she was not talking introducing british-style uniforms in germany .
it would be more of a case of students wearing unified pants , t-shirts , and sweatshirts . ulrich stahnke , headmaster of the school in bonn where the outcry began , called the debate about the introduction of school uniforms counterproductive . " it 's important to understand that solutions can only be found in cooperation with immigrant communities .
decisions made by religious outsiders like us are not accepted by muslims .

the girls ' actions were generally read as a political statement , and the pair was suspended from school .
the burka became well known in the west after it became mandatory garb for afghan women under the reactionary taliban regime . in an interview with the welt on sonntag newspaper about whether veiled pupils should be allowed to attend class in german high schools , zypries said " a simple solution to end the conflict would be having all students , male or female , wear uniforms to school .
that would not only get rid of burkas , but also clear up problems of social inequality " that get lived out through clothing . zypries warned about increasing resentment against foreigners in the schools , in part on religious grounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people do n't want to see burkas in german schools but a cry of opposition went out almost immediately .
the president of the german teachers ' association , josef kraus , called zypries " incredibly naive " to think religious and social discrimination could be reduced by introducing uniforms .
moreover , germany has a " problematic tradition " when it comes to school uniforms , kraus told netzeitung internet portal . uniforms in public institutions still call up the group mentality of the nazi era in germany . despite this , there have been occasional , though relatively isolated , attempts to introduce uniforms in german schools .
recently , two schools in the berlin district of spandau considered switching to school uniforms . advocates say uniforms do away with " brand envy " and reduce the chances of children from poorer families being ostracized because they can not afford the latest fashions .
and , they say , uniforms foster the feeling of being part of a group , and can help students identify with and even have pride in their school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries but up to now , the conference of education ministers that decide on national school policies , called the kmk , has come out against school uniforms .
they , too , cite historical reasons dating back to wwii , with the memories of uniforms worn by the hitler youth still too fresh in the public mind . on top of that , the conference has said , any general uniform rule would raise questions about how far the government can encroach on the personal liberties of students and parents . green opposition zypries ' remarks also met with strong criticism from germany 's green party , which has long championed a multicultural german society .
krista sager , a senior green party member , said the introduction of school uniforms would be an unacceptable interference by the state in religious affairs . " we certainly do n't need solutions imposed by the government .
what we need are individual solutions by the schools themselves that respect the situation on the ground and notably the religious freedom of pupils .
the introduction of school uniforms is generally no longer up to date and would be rejected by current generations of school students . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wearing school uniforms does n't appear to make these students - in australia - unhappy in europe , great britain is known as the nation that continues to impose uniforms on students .
but a spokesperson for zypries said the minister made it clear she was not talking introducing british-style uniforms in germany .
it would be more of a case of students wearing unified pants , t-shirts , and sweatshirts . ulrich stahnke , headmaster of the school in bonn where the outcry began , called the debate about the introduction of school uniforms counterproductive . " it 's important to understand that solutions can only be found in cooperation with immigrant communities .
decisions made by religious outsiders like us are not accepted by muslims .
but at my school it 's now important to make clear to them that we can not accept the burka . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do clothes make the student ?
only a handful of german schools have uniforms , but several are experimenting with the idea , hoping they can encourage reduced competition among students for the latest designer labels .
critics call it forced conformity .

and just like robin hood and his men , a gang of hamburg activists are proving difficult to catch despite the fact they dress as superheroes when they raid swanky stores . a bunch of egalitarian criminals who go by such names as " spider mum " and " santa guevara " are being referred to as modern-day germany 's version of robin hood and his merry men .
and just like the sheriff of nottingham in the legend of sherwood forest 's most famous outlaw , the hamburg police are at a loss when it comes to stopping them . the group , which calls itself " hamburg umsonst " - loosely translated as hamburg without charge , has apparently graduated from handing out flyers with tips on how to forge cinema tickets and travel illegally on public transport to raiding the swankiest stores and delicatessens before distributing their swag to the city 's poor . their most high profile job to date came last week .
dressed in an array of comic book hero costumes , the gang raided a well-to-do eatery in the north german port city last friday during work hours and absconded with a large amount of fine food - after posing for a publicity photograph with bemused staff .
hamburg cops called to the crime scene drew a blank despite deploying 14 patrol cars and a police helicopter . according to eye witnesses , the " hamburg umsonst " raiding party consisted of around 30 people who apparently knew what they were doing when it came to fancy eats and drinks .
the everyday shoplifter will probably not take the time to savor the array of produce on hand before sticking a box of valrhona chocolates down their pants .

while carrying out their raids in order to support the one-euro jobbers , exploited employees and those on benefits , the gang have been unable to resist the sating of the ego . in what could eventually be their undoing , the caped food raiders have shown a penchant for leaving notes at the scene of their crimes which carry statements such as : " without the abilities of a superhero , survival is impossible in the town of the millionaires . " until the police get a break , upmarket shopkeepers in hamburg are advised to keep their doors closed to anyone wearing spandex tights and a mexican wrestling mask . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de laughable law breakers germany has its fair share of unusual and sometimes inept law breakers .

and just like robin hood and his men , a gang of hamburg activists are proving difficult to catch despite the fact they dress as superheroes when they raid swanky stores . a bunch of egalitarian criminals who go by such names as " spider mum " and " santa guevara " are being referred to as modern-day germany 's version of robin hood and his merry men .
and just like the sheriff of nottingham in the legend of sherwood forest 's most famous outlaw , the hamburg police are at a loss when it comes to stopping them . the group , which calls itself " hamburg umsonst " - loosely translated as hamburg without charge , has apparently graduated from handing out flyers with tips on how to forge cinema tickets and travel illegally on public transport to raiding the swankiest stores and delicatessens before distributing their swag to the city 's poor . their most high profile job to date came last week .
dressed in an array of comic book hero costumes , the gang raided a well-to-do eatery in the north german port city last friday during work hours and absconded with a large amount of fine food - after posing for a publicity photograph with bemused staff .
hamburg cops called to the crime scene drew a blank despite deploying 14 patrol cars and a police helicopter . according to eye witnesses , the " hamburg umsonst " raiding party consisted of around 30 people who apparently knew what they were doing when it came to fancy eats and drinks .
the everyday shoplifter will probably not take the time to savor the array of produce on hand before sticking a box of valrhona chocolates down their pants .
it soon became obvious - these guys were pros . cops ca n't catch connoisseur crooks in costumes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gang 's get-away plan left the cops trailing behind the hamburg cops have little to go on except that the gang has a social conscience , know the difference between corned beef and kobe veal and have a seemingly unlimited supply of fancy dress costumes . but even the best laid plans of criminal masterminds have the odd weak spot .
while carrying out their raids in order to support the one-euro jobbers , exploited employees and those on benefits , the gang have been unable to resist the sating of the ego . in what could eventually be their undoing , the caped food raiders have shown a penchant for leaving notes at the scene of their crimes which carry statements such as : " without the abilities of a superhero , survival is impossible in the town of the millionaires . " until the police get a break , upmarket shopkeepers in hamburg are advised to keep their doors closed to anyone wearing spandex tights and a mexican wrestling mask . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de laughable law breakers germany has its fair share of unusual and sometimes inept law breakers .

after the match , they 're all going to need a place to sleep that leaves enough euros in their pocket for a celebratory dinner . the average price for accommodation during the world cup is 190 euros -lrb- $ 241 -rrb- per night - including everything from a youth hostel dorm room to a multi-star hotel suite , according to the fifa world cup accommodation services .
that 's a price some fans ca n't afford , according to ergin iyilikci , spokesperson for immobilienscout24 , an online real estate agent that has set up a special web site for people looking to rooms during the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even they will tire out eventually " the average hotel rates can make for a pricey night , " he said , explaining why young people and families are especially interested in internet sites where they have a chance to stay in the homes of other soccer fans at more affordable rates or free of charge . even for those willing to pay hotel prices , it is likely that there will not be enough rooms available , according nikola günther , who runs another site connecting tired world cup fans with empty beds . dema n d expected to i n crease i n may a n d ju n e " as soon as the decision was made that the world cup would take place in germany , we realized the number of hotel beds would not be enough , " günther said , adding that the site 's average price is between 20 euros and 40 euros per night . the more than 15,000 housing ads , including everything from a spare couch in the living room , to entire apartments and even a multi-room villa , currently outstrip demand , but that 's expected to change as the cup approaches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spare sofa is all some soccer fans are looking for the lists of accommodation are free to people looking for a place to stay , some , however , charge potential hosts as a way of filtering jokers registering their neighbor 's house from serious offers .
hosts are given free reign in determining how much to charge guests . " we 're convinced supply and demand will keep the prices under control , " iyilikci said .
" people who want 500 euros a night wo n't find anyone interested in their place . " rooms cheaper , more perso n al i n host 's home many of the people offering to put up a stranded soccer fan or two , like munich 's gerhard schubert , are n't asking for any payment at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many desperate soccer fans could squeeze into the typical living room ?
" i would much rather stay somewhere more personal than a hotel when i travel and thought i could give the same chance to someone else , " said the 43-year-old soccer fan , who is offering to pull out the sofa-bed in his guest room free of charge .
" i know how expensive munich can be . " andreas schlüter , 27 , said he and his roommate thought offering their hamburg apartment 's extra room to soccer fans was a great idea .

following a rate of 2.2 percent in 2005 , euro-zone inflation was forecast to remain at 2.2 percent this year and next . however , the commission said that oil prices represented the " biggest near-term risk " to european economies .
" the very low spare capacities make markets extremely vulnerable to actual and potential supply disruptions , " the commission said . because of market volatility , forecasts that oil would average $ 68.9 per barrel for 2006 and $ 71 per barrel for 2007 were subject to change , it added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economy gathers steam , institutes revise forecast german economic performance is predicted to grow by 1.8 percent in 2006 , the highest rate in six years , the country 's six leading economic institutes said .

they were incredibly consistent all season and that is the difference , " said schaaf . former bayern star mario basler congratulated his ex-club - where he won three bundesliga titles - but admitted he was hoping for some stronger competition in the future .

" now he has to discuss it with hamburg . " but whoever comes in at the allianz arena , it will be very hard to fill the void left by the expected departure of ballack , germany 's one true world star .
ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .
his association with the club has helped the one outstanding german team command a higher profile on the global soccer stage . ballack defection a sign of bayern waning power ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack lured by chelsea 's money and future success ?
however , his anticipated loss to the english champions will expose bayern 's shortcomings both on and off the pitch where richer and potentially more successful clubs can swoop for their players in the same way as bayern feed of their rivals in the domestic transfer market . off the pitch , even if podolski and van buyten come , the bavarians will still need to find someone who can play such an effective all-round game in midfield and bring that star quality to the team . hoeness believes that man will be julio dos santos , the 22-year-old paraguay midfielder who joined bayern in january but who has yet to make his bundesliga debut .
" he 's going to have a big impact , " hoeness said . in the bundesliga , that may be true .

" it is great to wrap up the title with a week to go , " said bayern munich coach felix magath .
" to defend the double is unique and the team has been exceptional .
we can all be very proud of our achievement and there will be some celebrations tonight for sure . " magath arrived from vfb stuttgart in july 2004 and has lifted back-to-back doubles in his first two seasons . " full credit to felix -lrb- magath -rrb- .

with praise for another record-breaking season still ringing in their ears , bayern munich 's hierarchy begin to plan for another season of dominance . bayern 's 1-1 draw with kaiserslautern on saturday coupled with sv hamburg 's 4-2 loss against hertha berlin helped the club to a 20th domestic title adding to their cup triumph over eintracht frankfurt . the title win gave the bavarian giants another record : the first team to win a league and cup double in successive seasons . " it is great to wrap up the title with a week to go , " said bayern munich coach felix magath .
" to defend the double is unique and the team has been exceptional .
we can all be very proud of our achievement and there will be some celebrations tonight for sure . " magath arrived from vfb stuttgart in july 2004 and has lifted back-to-back doubles in his first two seasons . " full credit to felix -lrb- magath -rrb- .
he has won two league and cup doubles in a row .
that is mightily impressive , " said general manager uli hoeness . bayern were far from convincing against lowly kaiserslautern but captain oliver kahn saluted his team for winning a sixth title in eight seasons .
" kaiserslautern made it difficult but we have a lot of experience in title battles and used it , " said the german international goalkeeper . " we have dominated the league this season and deserve to win the title .
you need to come up with the big points at the right time and we did that . " closest rivals gracious in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas ottl squeezes in the title-winning goal sv hamburg were bayern 's main challengers this season but their manager thomas doll admitted the best team had won .
" congratulations to bayern on their title win , " doll said .
" they were the best team and deserved to finish top . " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf , who led the club to the title in 2004 , also saluted bayern 's achievements .
" i offer my compliments to bayern .
they were incredibly consistent all season and that is the difference , " said schaaf . former bayern star mario basler congratulated his ex-club - where he won three bundesliga titles - but admitted he was hoping for some stronger competition in the future .
" well done to bayern but to be honest it is getting a bit boring now , " basler said . bayern have won 20 domestic titles with fc nuremberg the next best on nine although their last triumph came way back in 1968 . bayern oils the revolving door for summer sales for bayern to win their 21st title next season , there will have to be a change of personnel as a number of senior players - most notably the chelsea-bound michael ballack - are considering ending their association with the record-breaking bundesliga champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even physical restraint is unlikely to stop podolski leaving while speculation is rife about those who will be on their way out , one who seems destined to be on his way in is fc cologne striker lukas podolski . the 20-year-old international forward is regarded as one of germany 's best young players and since his current club are due to be relegated at the end of this season , it seems most likely that he will continue his career in the top flight by joining the powerful bavarians for the next campaign . " we 'll carry out talks with a view to getting him by july 1 , " bayern manager uli hoeness told reporters in cologne .
according to hoeness , a deal with podolski 's agent for the player was " as good as agreed " although bayern have yet to speak to cologne . prince poldi and van buyten targeted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buyten could be saying his farewells to hamburg another addition could be rivals sv hamburg 's inspirational captain daniel van buyten .
" he has let it be known that he wants to come to us , " hoeness said of the 28-year-old belgian centre-back .
" now he has to discuss it with hamburg . " but whoever comes in at the allianz arena , it will be very hard to fill the void left by the expected departure of ballack , germany 's one true world star .
ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .
his association with the club has helped the one outstanding german team command a higher profile on the global soccer stage . ballack defection a sign of bayern waning power ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack lured by chelsea 's money and future success ?
however , his anticipated loss to the english champions will expose bayern 's shortcomings both on and off the pitch where richer and potentially more successful clubs can swoop for their players in the same way as bayern feed of their rivals in the domestic transfer market . off the pitch , even if podolski and van buyten come , the bavarians will still need to find someone who can play such an effective all-round game in midfield and bring that star quality to the team . hoeness believes that man will be julio dos santos , the 22-year-old paraguay midfielder who joined bayern in january but who has yet to make his bundesliga debut .
" he 's going to have a big impact , " hoeness said . in the bundesliga , that may be true .
but the real question for a club which craves european success as much as bayern is : can he be the new michael ballack ?
the most likely answer to that is that you can not replace the irreplaceable . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern win 20th german league title in kaiserslautern draw one week after winning the german cup , bayern munich also laid claim to the german championship in the season 's penultimate week on saturday and became the first team to achieve the double victory two years in a row .

it also estimated that growth in the 25-nation eu would peak this year at 2.3 percent after 1.6 percent last year .
growth was forecast to ease back slightly to 2.2 percent next year . " both the eu and the euro area are expected to grow markedly stronger this year , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . european economies were reaping the benefits this year of firming domestic and foreign demand , which encouraged companies to make investments even though rising interest rates were making borrowing more expensive . the commission said in the report containing its forecasts that " investment is set to continue growing at a rapid pace underpinned by optimistic business sentiment , a favorable profit outlook and the increased need for replacement investment . "

oil prices pose big risk despite the improving economic outlook however , public finances in the euro zone were not expected to strengthen .

following a rate of 2.2 percent in 2005 , euro-zone inflation was forecast to remain at 2.2 percent this year and next . however , the commission said that oil prices represented the " biggest near-term risk " to european economies .
" the very low spare capacities make markets extremely vulnerable to actual and potential supply disruptions , " the commission said . because of market volatility , forecasts that oil would average $ 68.9 per barrel for 2006 and $ 71 per barrel for 2007 were subject to change , it added . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german economy gathers steam , institutes revise forecast german economic performance is predicted to grow by 1.8 percent in 2006 , the highest rate in six years , the country 's six leading economic institutes said .

angela merkel received many plaudits during her recent visit to washington .
but the hospitality afforded her may be part of a ruse to lure germany into the us foreign policy fold , according to dw 's peter philipp . it appears that german chancellor angela merkel knows how to deal with the man in the white house .
just how well can be judged by the applause she gets on her visits to washington . the ease with which merkel deals with bush , the chemistry she helps to create between them and the success of the meetings between the two leaders can be judged by the length of these outbursts of appreciation and measured by how many minutes they run over their expected duration . but while the applause can be used as a yardstick to gauge merkel 's growing stature in german-us affairs , the responses to the german chancellor are not just about her own performance and the growing respect for her in the states .
it is not only frau merkel who is on the charm offensive .
president bush wants to win germany and the germans over and bring them into line with his foreign policy . bush turning on his own charm to win over germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush is liking what he 's hearing from germany bush is now willing to appear on german talk shows and give exclusive interviews to tabloids as well as accepting an invitation from merkel to visit her constituency in germany . he has also apparently swallowed the bitter pill of germany 's opposition to the iraq war and has made clumsy attempts at expressing his understanding of why the germans so vehemently opposed the 2003 invasion . for bush , iraq is in the past .
his current preoccupation is iran .
and to make any kind of progress in this situation , bush needs all the support he can get . there is none of that coming from china and russia , about which the us issued a report calling vladimir putin 's country a failing democracy .
this is , however , nothing new in washington 's thinking , and bush still considers putin to be someone he can talk with . talk , maybe , but there is no guarantee that any discussions will be able to persuade putin to take the us-favored stance on iran .
merkel , however , is a different matter - at least in bush 's view .
while russia and china see the perceived anti-iran strategy in the us as an obstacle , berlin appears to be aligned with washington . is berlin ready for the us version of diplomacy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the chancellor ready to fully endorse us foreign policy ?
merkel 's public declarations on this alignment are based on the common desire to solve " the problem " through diplomacy .
however , it has long been accepted that the white house version of diplomacy means that the opposition must give in to the us way of thinking . if this does n't happen - and tehran has given no indication that it is ready to bend to us will - then diplomacy gives way to the use of power . is germany ready to follow the us down this path ?
did bush make a good case to the chancellor regarding this possibility in the privacy of the oval office ?
and if merkel ’ s germany is to follow bush on iran , will it also be prepared to back up us solidarity with israel with action if necessary ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when gerhard schröder declared a similar " unlimited solidarity " with the us after september 11 , 2001 , it alienated some germans .

the burka became well known in the west after it became mandatory garb for afghan women under the reactionary taliban regime . in an interview with the welt on sonntag newspaper about whether veiled pupils should be allowed to attend class in german high schools , zypries said " a simple solution to end the conflict would be having all students , male or female , wear uniforms to school .

krista sager , a senior green party member , said the introduction of school uniforms would be an unacceptable interference by the state in religious affairs . " we certainly do n't need solutions imposed by the government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.05.2006 in germany , veiled students stir up uniform debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one potsdam school introduced a dress code in january a debate over whether to mandate school uniforms in germany broke out after two muslim girls were suspended from school in bonn for coming veiled from head to toe in a traditional opaque garb known as a burka . over the weekend , german justice minister brigitte zypries spoke out in favor of introducing school uniforms , unleashing a storm of opinion from commentators and politicians across the country . the debate broke out anew after two 18-year-old muslim girls came to their high school in bonn dressed in traditional burkas - veils that covered them entirely , except for a small mesh slit at the eyes .
the girls ' actions were generally read as a political statement , and the pair was suspended from school .
the burka became well known in the west after it became mandatory garb for afghan women under the reactionary taliban regime . in an interview with the welt on sonntag newspaper about whether veiled pupils should be allowed to attend class in german high schools , zypries said " a simple solution to end the conflict would be having all students , male or female , wear uniforms to school .
that would not only get rid of burkas , but also clear up problems of social inequality " that get lived out through clothing . zypries warned about increasing resentment against foreigners in the schools , in part on religious grounds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people do n't want to see burkas in german schools but a cry of opposition went out almost immediately .
the president of the german teachers ' association , josef kraus , called zypries " incredibly naive " to think religious and social discrimination could be reduced by introducing uniforms .
moreover , germany has a " problematic tradition " when it comes to school uniforms , kraus told netzeitung internet portal . uniforms in public institutions still call up the group mentality of the nazi era in germany . despite this , there have been occasional , though relatively isolated , attempts to introduce uniforms in german schools .
recently , two schools in the berlin district of spandau considered switching to school uniforms . advocates say uniforms do away with " brand envy " and reduce the chances of children from poorer families being ostracized because they can not afford the latest fashions .
and , they say , uniforms foster the feeling of being part of a group , and can help students identify with and even have pride in their school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries but up to now , the conference of education ministers that decide on national school policies , called the kmk , has come out against school uniforms .
they , too , cite historical reasons dating back to wwii , with the memories of uniforms worn by the hitler youth still too fresh in the public mind . on top of that , the conference has said , any general uniform rule would raise questions about how far the government can encroach on the personal liberties of students and parents . green opposition zypries ' remarks also met with strong criticism from germany 's green party , which has long championed a multicultural german society .
krista sager , a senior green party member , said the introduction of school uniforms would be an unacceptable interference by the state in religious affairs . " we certainly do n't need solutions imposed by the government .
what we need are individual solutions by the schools themselves that respect the situation on the ground and notably the religious freedom of pupils .
the introduction of school uniforms is generally no longer up to date and would be rejected by current generations of school students . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wearing school uniforms does n't appear to make these students - in australia - unhappy in europe , great britain is known as the nation that continues to impose uniforms on students .
but a spokesperson for zypries said the minister made it clear she was not talking introducing british-style uniforms in germany .
it would be more of a case of students wearing unified pants , t-shirts , and sweatshirts . ulrich stahnke , headmaster of the school in bonn where the outcry began , called the debate about the introduction of school uniforms counterproductive . " it 's important to understand that solutions can only be found in cooperation with immigrant communities .
decisions made by religious outsiders like us are not accepted by muslims .
but at my school it 's now important to make clear to them that we can not accept the burka . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de do clothes make the student ?
only a handful of german schools have uniforms , but several are experimenting with the idea , hoping they can encourage reduced competition among students for the latest designer labels .
critics call it forced conformity .

with praise for another record-breaking season still ringing in their ears , bayern munich 's hierarchy begin to plan for another season of dominance . bayern 's 1-1 draw with kaiserslautern on saturday coupled with sv hamburg 's 4-2 loss against hertha berlin helped the club to a 20th domestic title adding to their cup triumph over eintracht frankfurt . the title win gave the bavarian giants another record : the first team to win a league and cup double in successive seasons . " it is great to wrap up the title with a week to go , " said bayern munich coach felix magath .
" to defend the double is unique and the team has been exceptional .
we can all be very proud of our achievement and there will be some celebrations tonight for sure . " magath arrived from vfb stuttgart in july 2004 and has lifted back-to-back doubles in his first two seasons . " full credit to felix -lrb- magath -rrb- .
he has won two league and cup doubles in a row .
that is mightily impressive , " said general manager uli hoeness . bayern were far from convincing against lowly kaiserslautern but captain oliver kahn saluted his team for winning a sixth title in eight seasons .
" kaiserslautern made it difficult but we have a lot of experience in title battles and used it , " said the german international goalkeeper . " we have dominated the league this season and deserve to win the title .
you need to come up with the big points at the right time and we did that . " closest rivals gracious in defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas ottl squeezes in the title-winning goal sv hamburg were bayern 's main challengers this season but their manager thomas doll admitted the best team had won .
" congratulations to bayern on their title win , " doll said .
" they were the best team and deserved to finish top . " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf , who led the club to the title in 2004 , also saluted bayern 's achievements .
" i offer my compliments to bayern .
they were incredibly consistent all season and that is the difference , " said schaaf . former bayern star mario basler congratulated his ex-club - where he won three bundesliga titles - but admitted he was hoping for some stronger competition in the future .
" well done to bayern but to be honest it is getting a bit boring now , " basler said . bayern have won 20 domestic titles with fc nuremberg the next best on nine although their last triumph came way back in 1968 . bayern oils the revolving door for summer sales for bayern to win their 21st title next season , there will have to be a change of personnel as a number of senior players - most notably the chelsea-bound michael ballack - are considering ending their association with the record-breaking bundesliga champions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even physical restraint is unlikely to stop podolski leaving while speculation is rife about those who will be on their way out , one who seems destined to be on his way in is fc cologne striker lukas podolski . the 20-year-old international forward is regarded as one of germany 's best young players and since his current club are due to be relegated at the end of this season , it seems most likely that he will continue his career in the top flight by joining the powerful bavarians for the next campaign . " we 'll carry out talks with a view to getting him by july 1 , " bayern manager uli hoeness told reporters in cologne .
according to hoeness , a deal with podolski 's agent for the player was " as good as agreed " although bayern have yet to speak to cologne . prince poldi and van buyten targeted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van buyten could be saying his farewells to hamburg another addition could be rivals sv hamburg 's inspirational captain daniel van buyten .
" he has let it be known that he wants to come to us , " hoeness said of the 28-year-old belgian centre-back .
" now he has to discuss it with hamburg . " but whoever comes in at the allianz arena , it will be very hard to fill the void left by the expected departure of ballack , germany 's one true world star .
ballack has scored 13 league goals this season from midfield and has been instrumental in helping bayern to their third double in the four years since he joined them from bayer leverkusen . ballack represents more than goals and creativity to bayern .
his association with the club has helped the one outstanding german team command a higher profile on the global soccer stage . ballack defection a sign of bayern waning power ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack lured by chelsea 's money and future success ?
however , his anticipated loss to the english champions will expose bayern 's shortcomings both on and off the pitch where richer and potentially more successful clubs can swoop for their players in the same way as bayern feed of their rivals in the domestic transfer market . off the pitch , even if podolski and van buyten come , the bavarians will still need to find someone who can play such an effective all-round game in midfield and bring that star quality to the team . hoeness believes that man will be julio dos santos , the 22-year-old paraguay midfielder who joined bayern in january but who has yet to make his bundesliga debut .
" he 's going to have a big impact , " hoeness said . in the bundesliga , that may be true .

since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration issues are n't the only problems german schools have " the educational system is not the cause of problems , but reflects society as a whole .
in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with learning difficulties may not get the support they need in school " there are so many pupils from families who offer no support whatsoever .

only 36 percent of migrant children who have the smarts to attend gymnasium do so , according to heinz-peter meidinger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.05.2006 modern-day robin hoods have hamburg cops baffled großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg cops are looking for a gang into high-profile theft and superhero costumes they steal from the rich and give to the poor .
and just like robin hood and his men , a gang of hamburg activists are proving difficult to catch despite the fact they dress as superheroes when they raid swanky stores . a bunch of egalitarian criminals who go by such names as " spider mum " and " santa guevara " are being referred to as modern-day germany 's version of robin hood and his merry men .
and just like the sheriff of nottingham in the legend of sherwood forest 's most famous outlaw , the hamburg police are at a loss when it comes to stopping them . the group , which calls itself " hamburg umsonst " - loosely translated as hamburg without charge , has apparently graduated from handing out flyers with tips on how to forge cinema tickets and travel illegally on public transport to raiding the swankiest stores and delicatessens before distributing their swag to the city 's poor . their most high profile job to date came last week .
dressed in an array of comic book hero costumes , the gang raided a well-to-do eatery in the north german port city last friday during work hours and absconded with a large amount of fine food - after posing for a publicity photograph with bemused staff .
hamburg cops called to the crime scene drew a blank despite deploying 14 patrol cars and a police helicopter . according to eye witnesses , the " hamburg umsonst " raiding party consisted of around 30 people who apparently knew what they were doing when it came to fancy eats and drinks .
the everyday shoplifter will probably not take the time to savor the array of produce on hand before sticking a box of valrhona chocolates down their pants .
it soon became obvious - these guys were pros . cops ca n't catch connoisseur crooks in costumes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gang 's get-away plan left the cops trailing behind the hamburg cops have little to go on except that the gang has a social conscience , know the difference between corned beef and kobe veal and have a seemingly unlimited supply of fancy dress costumes . but even the best laid plans of criminal masterminds have the odd weak spot .
while carrying out their raids in order to support the one-euro jobbers , exploited employees and those on benefits , the gang have been unable to resist the sating of the ego . in what could eventually be their undoing , the caped food raiders have shown a penchant for leaving notes at the scene of their crimes which carry statements such as : " without the abilities of a superhero , survival is impossible in the town of the millionaires . " until the police get a break , upmarket shopkeepers in hamburg are advised to keep their doors closed to anyone wearing spandex tights and a mexican wrestling mask . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de laughable law breakers germany has its fair share of unusual and sometimes inept law breakers .

and just like the sheriff of nottingham in the legend of sherwood forest 's most famous outlaw , the hamburg police are at a loss when it comes to stopping them . the group , which calls itself " hamburg umsonst " - loosely translated as hamburg without charge , has apparently graduated from handing out flyers with tips on how to forge cinema tickets and travel illegally on public transport to raiding the swankiest stores and delicatessens before distributing their swag to the city 's poor . their most high profile job to date came last week .
dressed in an array of comic book hero costumes , the gang raided a well-to-do eatery in the north german port city last friday during work hours and absconded with a large amount of fine food - after posing for a publicity photograph with bemused staff .
hamburg cops called to the crime scene drew a blank despite deploying 14 patrol cars and a police helicopter . according to eye witnesses , the " hamburg umsonst " raiding party consisted of around 30 people who apparently knew what they were doing when it came to fancy eats and drinks .

who 's to blame ?
the parents or the school system ?
or both ? politicians of all stripes agree on one thing : the equally gifted child from a working class immigrant background should have the same chance to enter university as the son of a dentist .
since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration issues are n't the only problems german schools have " the educational system is not the cause of problems , but reflects society as a whole .
in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with learning difficulties may not get the support they need in school " there are so many pupils from families who offer no support whatsoever .
so many parents could n't care less , " said barbara brüse , a primary school teacher in bonn who has spent decades teaching immigrant children . parents can even be counterproductive when faced with a bright child .
only 36 percent of migrant children who have the smarts to attend gymnasium do so , according to heinz-peter meidinger .

after the match , they 're all going to need a place to sleep that leaves enough euros in their pocket for a celebratory dinner . the average price for accommodation during the world cup is 190 euros -lrb- $ 241 -rrb- per night - including everything from a youth hostel dorm room to a multi-star hotel suite , according to the fifa world cup accommodation services .
that 's a price some fans ca n't afford , according to ergin iyilikci , spokesperson for immobilienscout24 , an online real estate agent that has set up a special web site for people looking to rooms during the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even they will tire out eventually " the average hotel rates can make for a pricey night , " he said , explaining why young people and families are especially interested in internet sites where they have a chance to stay in the homes of other soccer fans at more affordable rates or free of charge . even for those willing to pay hotel prices , it is likely that there will not be enough rooms available , according nikola günther , who runs another site connecting tired world cup fans with empty beds . dema n d expected to i n crease i n may a n d ju n e " as soon as the decision was made that the world cup would take place in germany , we realized the number of hotel beds would not be enough , " günther said , adding that the site 's average price is between 20 euros and 40 euros per night . the more than 15,000 housing ads , including everything from a spare couch in the living room , to entire apartments and even a multi-room villa , currently outstrip demand , but that 's expected to change as the cup approaches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a spare sofa is all some soccer fans are looking for the lists of accommodation are free to people looking for a place to stay , some , however , charge potential hosts as a way of filtering jokers registering their neighbor 's house from serious offers .
hosts are given free reign in determining how much to charge guests . " we 're convinced supply and demand will keep the prices under control , " iyilikci said .
" people who want 500 euros a night wo n't find anyone interested in their place . " rooms cheaper , more perso n al i n host 's home many of the people offering to put up a stranded soccer fan or two , like munich 's gerhard schubert , are n't asking for any payment at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how many desperate soccer fans could squeeze into the typical living room ?
" i would much rather stay somewhere more personal than a hotel when i travel and thought i could give the same chance to someone else , " said the 43-year-old soccer fan , who is offering to pull out the sofa-bed in his guest room free of charge .
" i know how expensive munich can be . " andreas schlüter , 27 , said he and his roommate thought offering their hamburg apartment 's extra room to soccer fans was a great idea . " the world cup is called ' a time to make friends , ' and i think that should be brought to life , " he said , adding that he is n't worried about sharing his apartment with hooligans .
" i think only open people with good intentions take part in things like this . " just over half of germans are willing to take the world cup motto to heart by housing fans , according to a study commissioned by immobilenscout24 . fa n s make good city guides for other fa n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans enjoy each other 's company - especially after the game the types of personal exchanges that take place when fans from different countries also show that fans can be friends and rivals at the same time , according to marc bialojahn of ei n dach für fa n s -lrb- a roof for friends -rrb- . " for 90 minutes a healthy rivalry dominates everything - that 's good because that 's what makes soccer great , " he said .
" then you can talk reasonably to each other and go out and have a beer together .

and just like robin hood and his men , a gang of hamburg activists are proving difficult to catch despite the fact they dress as superheroes when they raid swanky stores . a bunch of egalitarian criminals who go by such names as " spider mum " and " santa guevara " are being referred to as modern-day germany 's version of robin hood and his merry men .
and just like the sheriff of nottingham in the legend of sherwood forest 's most famous outlaw , the hamburg police are at a loss when it comes to stopping them . the group , which calls itself " hamburg umsonst " - loosely translated as hamburg without charge , has apparently graduated from handing out flyers with tips on how to forge cinema tickets and travel illegally on public transport to raiding the swankiest stores and delicatessens before distributing their swag to the city 's poor . their most high profile job to date came last week .
dressed in an array of comic book hero costumes , the gang raided a well-to-do eatery in the north german port city last friday during work hours and absconded with a large amount of fine food - after posing for a publicity photograph with bemused staff .
hamburg cops called to the crime scene drew a blank despite deploying 14 patrol cars and a police helicopter . according to eye witnesses , the " hamburg umsonst " raiding party consisted of around 30 people who apparently knew what they were doing when it came to fancy eats and drinks .
the everyday shoplifter will probably not take the time to savor the array of produce on hand before sticking a box of valrhona chocolates down their pants .
it soon became obvious - these guys were pros . cops ca n't catch connoisseur crooks in costumes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gang 's get-away plan left the cops trailing behind the hamburg cops have little to go on except that the gang has a social conscience , know the difference between corned beef and kobe veal and have a seemingly unlimited supply of fancy dress costumes . but even the best laid plans of criminal masterminds have the odd weak spot .
while carrying out their raids in order to support the one-euro jobbers , exploited employees and those on benefits , the gang have been unable to resist the sating of the ego . in what could eventually be their undoing , the caped food raiders have shown a penchant for leaving notes at the scene of their crimes which carry statements such as : " without the abilities of a superhero , survival is impossible in the town of the millionaires . " until the police get a break , upmarket shopkeepers in hamburg are advised to keep their doors closed to anyone wearing spandex tights and a mexican wrestling mask . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de laughable law breakers germany has its fair share of unusual and sometimes inept law breakers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education tuition fees face uphill battle in germany study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch private universities take hold in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative germany -pipe- 08.05.2006 german schools : creating social division or reflecting it ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say germany 's educational system is far from egalitarian chancellor merkel wants to hold a high-level integration summit after last month 's crisis at a berlin school whose pupils are mainly from immigrant families .
who 's to blame ?
the parents or the school system ?
or both ? politicians of all stripes agree on one thing : the equally gifted child from a working class immigrant background should have the same chance to enter university as the son of a dentist .
since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration issues are n't the only problems german schools have " the educational system is not the cause of problems , but reflects society as a whole .
in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with learning difficulties may not get the support they need in school " there are so many pupils from families who offer no support whatsoever .
so many parents could n't care less , " said barbara brüse , a primary school teacher in bonn who has spent decades teaching immigrant children . parents can even be counterproductive when faced with a bright child .
only 36 percent of migrant children who have the smarts to attend gymnasium do so , according to heinz-peter meidinger .
" there is resistance to sending girls in particular , because the attitude is : what does she need an education for ? " is a good education so unimportant to migrant families ?
" our educational system should have the ambition to change those values , " concluded andreas schleicher . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government planning integration summit in an attempt to develop a new integration concept , the german government will organize a summit to address a wide range of issues surrounding immigrants and their families .

who 's to blame ?
the parents or the school system ?
or both ? politicians of all stripes agree on one thing : the equally gifted child from a working class immigrant background should have the same chance to enter university as the son of a dentist .
since police were brought in to control violence at a berlin hauptschule where over 80 percent of pupils come from muslim immigrant families the question of what can be done to remedy such social inequities has become a political hot potato .
hauptschule is the lowest rung in a three-tier educational system that tracks pupils according to academic performance by age 10 .
critics say it is a dumping ground for social misfits and migrant children with poor language skills .
some would like to see the entire system overhauled .
" back in the industrial age , the tripartite system worked , since the goal was to maximize the academic potential of only a few , but it has no place in a modern society , " said andreas schleicher , an education expert at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris . educational system reflects society " migrants are not more stupid .
there is too little being done to push language competence .
we need to ask ourselves , how can we support the child individually ? " added schleicher .
in germany , those from more affluent families are at least four times more likely to achieve the abitur , the diploma that is the ticket to higher education .
family background has always played a critical role in achievement in every industrial nation , according to heinz-peter meidinger , head of deutsche philologenverband , an association of gymnasium teachers .
the gymnasium is the most academically demanding path and leads to the abitur .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration issues are n't the only problems german schools have " the educational system is not the cause of problems , but reflects society as a whole .
in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kids with learning difficulties may not get the support they need in school " there are so many pupils from families who offer no support whatsoever .
so many parents could n't care less , " said barbara brüse , a primary school teacher in bonn who has spent decades teaching immigrant children . parents can even be counterproductive when faced with a bright child .
only 36 percent of migrant children who have the smarts to attend gymnasium do so , according to heinz-peter meidinger .
" there is resistance to sending girls in particular , because the attitude is : what does she need an education for ? " is a good education so unimportant to migrant families ?

in germany , we have a terrible integration problem , which is in part due to the type of immigrant who came here , " said meidinger . in the 1950s , postwar germany needed low-skilled labor for its wirtschaftswunder , and imported guest workers , largely from turkey , who were supposed to go home , but many did n't . " germany has reacted far too late to the reality that we have this ethnic underclass that is here to stay , and too little is being done to integrate those who have been here for generations , " said klaus bade , a professor at the institute for migration research at osnabrück university .
the main problem of integration has to do with poverty and poor education , according to bade .
parental support essential investing in education is a place to start .
" we need more teachers , smaller classes , full-day schools and to get away from the mentality that you get rid of the problem by getting rid of the kid , " said bade .
at the primary level , most german schools are open only long enough to send a child home for a hot lunch .
parents are expected to help with homework , with some investing in tutoring if a child has a learning problem , so that a mediocre pupil with home support still stands a better chance of entering gymnasium than a brighter child from a poor migrant family .

there are plans for maternity units at aberystwyth 's bronglais hospital , and withybush in haverfordwest to become midwife rather than consultant led .
one consultant has warned that the changes to maternity services could put mothers and babies at risk .
but health bosses say the current set-up is " unsustainable " .
a review of medical services in mid and west wales has produced plans to make child health and maternity services at bronglais and withybush hospitals midwife-led , with a consultant-led unit in the carmarthen area .
there were similar plans in the north of scotland where the local health board had proposed to move consultant-led maternity services from caithness general hospital in wick to a unit more than 100 miles away to inverness .
a campaign involving politicians , businessmen and local councillors eventually defeated the plans .
george bruce urged campaigners to fight the west wales proposals speaking on bbc wales ' taro naw programme , the chairman of the scottish north action group , george bruce , urged campaigners in west wales to oppose the plans in their area .
he said : " fight , fight and fight again ... because if you value the service , that 's the only way you 're going to retain it . "
opposition to the west wales plans has also come from chris overton , consultant obstetrician at withybush hospital , who said moving the services could pose a risk for mothers and newborn babies .
" it 's estimated that approximately 100 women would have to be transferred in labour from withybush , " he said .
" things can go wrong in this transfer , and there would be an increased risk . "
but the chief executive of the ceredigion local health board , derrick jones , said the current configuration of services was " unsustainable " .
' no details ' another proposal in the recent west wales health review is to build a new district general hospital between carmarthen and haverfordwest .
plaid cymru am rhodri glyn thomas said he believed the proposal could divert attention from the plans to downgrade services at haverfordwest and aberystwyth .
he said : " we have no details regarding whether a new hospital is going to happen , and i 'm afraid this could be a smokescreen . "
but mr jones , of ceredigion lhbs , insisted that the new hospital was a viable proposition .

one consultant has warned that the changes to maternity services could put mothers and babies at risk .
but health bosses say the current set-up is " unsustainable " .
a review of medical services in mid and west wales has produced plans to make child health and maternity services at bronglais and withybush hospitals midwife-led , with a consultant-led unit in the carmarthen area .
there were similar plans in the north of scotland where the local health board had proposed to move consultant-led maternity services from caithness general hospital in wick to a unit more than 100 miles away to inverness .
a campaign involving politicians , businessmen and local councillors eventually defeated the plans .
george bruce urged campaigners to fight the west wales proposals speaking on bbc wales ' taro naw programme , the chairman of the scottish north action group , george bruce , urged campaigners in west wales to oppose the plans in their area .
he said : " fight , fight and fight again ... because if you value the service , that 's the only way you 're going to retain it . "
opposition to the west wales plans has also come from chris overton , consultant obstetrician at withybush hospital , who said moving the services could pose a risk for mothers and newborn babies .

"
i left scotland in 1999 in search of adventure , believing that by helping other people i would discover a lot about myself in the process .
i never knew that i was enamoured of africa ; it kind of just happened that way .
after nine months in namibia with a small charity , i joined oxfam at their headquarters in oxford .
i did pretty much anything i could , from answering phones to sending out circulars , to having real discussions on what i thought i could do myself to end poverty and suffering .
then they sent me to sudan , where i spent a dusty and tough five months .
you really feel it when you are in a remote and isolated environment , without the advantages of clean water and electricity , creature comforts and family , about how lucky you really are in your life at home .
and how necessary it is to put those creature comforts aside in order to help others .
that really hit home when i went to liberia , where i have spent the last 18 months working in the capital monrovia on oxfam 's urban water and sanitation programme .
liberia has been in crisis since the early 1980s , when an uneducated army officer took over the country . "
nobody has piped safe water : not the new president ; not the 15,000 un peacekeepers and definitely not the young people under the age of 18 " his bloody coup marked the beginning of the end for a country that had been among the continent 's most prosperous since it was settled in 1847 by freed american slaves .
the 1980 coup was followed by another one in 1989 and then another civil war in 1999 .
peace has settled over liberia since 2003 , but it 's a fragile peace , made even more fragile by the lack of basic services facing the country 's three million people , one in three of whom live in the capital .
nobody has piped safe water : not the new president , not the 15,000 un peacekeepers and definitely not the young people under the age of 18 who make up half the country 's population .
they have known nothing but war and the poverty that arises from wholesale conflict .
you spend a lot of time talking to people in monrovia ; everyone has at least one or two stories to tell in their broad liberian english that takes its cues both from current us slang and an archaic english better suited to the 19th century .
and everyone talks about how they do n't have " current " , or electricity ; how they have to " tote " their water ; how they worry about the diseases and sicknesses afflicting their children because all they have are flimsy plastic sachets of water to drink , to wash in and to cook with .
oxfam works in these communities with partners such as the european community 's humanitarian office as well as the uk government 's department for international development .
we are trying to reduce the risks of water-borne diseases such as cholera and prevent infestations of mosquitoes that can lead to outbreaks of malaria , by making the water delivery systems that much safer .
since june 2005 , oxfam and its partners have installed more than 100 water points in communities across monrovia , after long consultation with community members themselves . "
you can not be anything less than amazed at the resilience of these people " we also work with the waterboys who deliver cans of water in wheelbarrows , making sure that they are not taken advantage of or compromised in their pursuit of an honest living , providing an important service to the poorest communities .
while the focus of the urban monrovia programme is public health and malaria control , these water and sanitation projects are also an opportunity for communities to come together , to try and reconcile with one another in the aftermath of liberia 's gruelling war .
you can not be anything less than amazed at the resilience of these people , who despite ethnic and racial and generational divides live in this crowded city , most of them ready to put everything aside in the interests of peace .
i have left liberia for indonesia in the last month , heading to a remote area afflicted by the december 2004 tsunami in an effort to help restore their own water and sanitation systems .
but i am proud of the work i did in liberia , mostly because of the national staff who made everything possible .
more than anything i hope that the programme gets the support it needs to continue , because it 's really not just about building latrines - it 's about putting in place a system that can serve people for the long-term , and keep them healthy . "

then they sent me to sudan , where i spent a dusty and tough five months .
you really feel it when you are in a remote and isolated environment , without the advantages of clean water and electricity , creature comforts and family , about how lucky you really are in your life at home .
and how necessary it is to put those creature comforts aside in order to help others .
that really hit home when i went to liberia , where i have spent the last 18 months working in the capital monrovia on oxfam 's urban water and sanitation programme .
liberia has been in crisis since the early 1980s , when an uneducated army officer took over the country .
nobody has piped safe water : not the new president ; not the 15,000 un peacekeepers and definitely not the young people under the age of 18 his bloody coup marked the beginning of the end for a country that had been among the continent 's most prosperous since it was settled in 1847 by freed american slaves .
the 1980 coup was followed by another one in 1989 and then another civil war in 1999 .
peace has settled over liberia since 2003 , but it 's a fragile peace , made even more fragile by the lack of basic services facing the country 's three million people , one in three of whom live in the capital .
nobody has piped safe water : not the new president , not the 15,000 un peacekeepers and definitely not the young people under the age of 18 who make up half the country 's population .
they have known nothing but war and the poverty that arises from wholesale conflict .
you spend a lot of time talking to people in monrovia ; everyone has at least one or two stories to tell in their broad liberian english that takes its cues both from current us slang and an archaic english better suited to the 19th century .
liberian youngsters pumping dirty water out of a well and everyone talks about how they do n't have " current " , or electricity ; how they have to " tote " their water ; how they worry about the diseases and sicknesses afflicting their children because all they have are flimsy plastic sachets of water to drink , to wash in and to cook with .
oxfam works in these communities with partners such as the european community 's humanitarian office as well as the uk government 's department for international development .
we are trying to reduce the risks of water-borne diseases such as cholera and prevent infestations of mosquitoes that can lead to outbreaks of malaria , by making the water delivery systems that much safer .
since june 2005 , oxfam and its partners have installed more than 100 water points in communities across monrovia , after long consultation with community members themselves .
you can not be anything less than amazed at the resilience of these people we also work with the waterboys who deliver cans of water in wheelbarrows , making sure that they are not taken advantage of or compromised in their pursuit of an honest living , providing an important service to the poorest communities .
while the focus of the urban monrovia programme is public health and malaria control , these water and sanitation projects are also an opportunity for communities to come together , to try and reconcile with one another in the aftermath of liberia 's gruelling war .
you can not be anything less than amazed at the resilience of these people , who despite ethnic and racial and generational divides live in this crowded city , most of them ready to put everything aside in the interests of peace .
i have left liberia for indonesia in the last month , heading to a remote area afflicted by the december 2004 tsunami in an effort to help restore their own water and sanitation systems .
but i am proud of the work i did in liberia , mostly because of the national staff who made everything possible .
more than anything i hope that the programme gets the support it needs to continue , because it 's really not just about building latrines - it 's about putting in place a system that can serve people for the long-term , and keep them healthy .

the fostering network has urged the scottish executive to limit the number of children put into homes to three , in line with the rest of the uk .
unlike elsewhere , there is currently no limit to the number of children placed in foster homes .
the scottish executive said it had no immediate plans to restrict numbers but would keep the issue under review .
to mark the start of this year 's foster care fortnight on monday , the fostering network has called on the executive to introduce a limit on the number of foster children per household .
we need the scottish executive to implement a limit of three children per foster family bryan ritchie fostering network scotland it has concerns about excessive pressure on carers and disruption to children 's lives .
the fostering network said statistics showed that there were 2,600 carers in scotland caring for an estimated 3,500 foster children on any given day .
one in every four of these children lives with a family which already cares for four or more children .
the organisation has warned that , in order to meet scotland 's total foster needs , an extra 1,700 foster families would be needed .
extra money director of fostering network scotland bryan ritchie said : " we need the scottish executive to implement a limit of three children per foster family , except for larger sibling groups , as is the case in northern ireland , england and wales .
" and secondly , we need more people to step forward and consider becoming foster carers themselves , to provide these children with the care and support they need . "
a spokesperson for the executive said : " there are currently no plans to introduce a statutory limit of children in a foster care placement .
you 've got to think of the individual needs of these children and of the needs of your own family jim joyce foster parent hear more " this issue was not included within the adoption and policy review group 's recent report .
however , we are aware of this issue and are considering whether a limit would be helpful . "
the executive said it has allocated an extra £ 12m to local authorities over the period 2005-07 to improve recruitment and retention of foster carers .
one council in scotland has raised the payments it gives to foster carers in an effort to attract more people .
child accommodation renfrewshire council said it would pay carers £ 353 per child or a pro-rata payment of £ 50 per child per day for care provided .
father-of-three jim joyce has two foster children and said foster parents should guard against taking on too much .
he said : " we have space here where we could , theoretically , accommodate seven or eight children if necessary .
" but we feel you 've got to think of the individual needs of these children and of the needs of your own family .
" it 's very important that foster carers think about that .
it 's not just about how many children they can help out because quantity is not necessarily helping the children . "

the howard league for penal reform report studied 86 offenders aged 18 to 20 in england and wales .
it said young men had high offending and re-offending rates but were largely ignored by initiatives to cut crime .
the home office said reducing re-offending was a priority , and that a strategy and standards were being developed for managing young offenders .
report author finola farrant said : " sending these young men to prison does virtually nothing to ensure that they will live crime-free lives on release . "
she added that prison could make their re-offending " all the more predictable " .
re-conviction rate more than 1,000 young men are sent to prison each month , and it costs £ 35,000 a year to keep them inside , said the howard league .
but its study - called out for good - claimed little constructive work took place in prisons or on release , and that nearly 70 % of those released from prison would be re-convicted within two years .

when asked what would help them stop committing crime , 55 % of the 86 young men who took part said getting a job , and about a quarter said stable housing would help .
ms farrant told bbc radio 4 's today that being in a relationship and " having far more constructive relationships with their families " were also identified as positive influences .
out for good concludes that the current system does little to ensure young adult offenders make amends for what they have done , or recognise the impact of their behaviour on individual victims , their families and the wider community .
ms farrant said : " such criminal neglect of young offenders puts the public at risk of further offending . "
' revolving door ' chief inspector of prisons anne owers said that in 2000 resources for under-18s in prison , such as education , training and support during and after imprisonment , had been improved , but that the same had not been done for young adults .
" it is very clear we need to put more resources in to make sure that we are not just creating , as the howard league is saying , a revolving door for these young people , " she said .
" wherever they are , whether they are in prison or outside in the community , we need to put resources into turning lives around at a time when they can be turned around so that what does n't happen is that they get launched on a career of offending , which is sadly happening to all too many of them . "
responding to the report , the home office said : " the national offender management service is developing a strategy and standards for the management of young adult offenders , both in custody and the community .

the howard league for penal reform report studied 86 offenders aged 18 to 20 in england and wales .

the latest are without doubt the most serious and may yet prove to be terminal .
and the statements from downing street and loyalist mps like stephen byers and john reid that people are out to " topple " the prime minister must rank as one of the greatest statements of the obvious ever .
it is now claimed 50 labour mps are willing to sign a letter , if one is eventually finalised , giving the prime minister just a few weeks to set out a clear timetable for his departure .
the underlying threat is that , if he does not , there will indeed be an attempt to topple him probably with a leadership election at this autumn 's party conference - which many in the labour party had already expected to be his last .
intensifying pressure but it appears the main aim , excluding the " usual suspects " who do want to remove him as soon as possible , is to force the prime minister to spell out clear plans for that much-talked-of " stable and orderly transition " of power , presumably to gordon brown . "
so blair has shuffled the thoroughly discredited pack and come up with yet another lame duck cabinet " terence phillips worcester , uk send us your comments full text : labour mps ' letter and the demands go well beyond that usual group of rebels who take every possible opportunity to demand his head .
mr brown may not have plunged in the knife during his weekend interviews - he knows what happens to " natural successors " , like conservative michael heseltine , when they become assassins .
but his words have still succeeded in intensifying the pressure on the prime minister to announce a detailed timetable for his resignation .
his repeated talk of the need for " renewal in government " and " a new generation of policies " , his reference to " the next stage of my political career " and his statement that people were " looking to " the prime minister for the next move left little room for doubt about his ambitions .
but he went further , suggesting mr blair was already " talking to people " about the transition of power and that the labour party wanted that stable and orderly transition .
disappointed he even went beyond that , suggesting the party needed to listen to concerns coming from voters not only in last week 's local polls but in last year 's general election - that was immediately interpreted as a recognition that big issues such as the war in iraq and some of the prime minister 's public sector reforms were a factor in the party 's performance and may need attention . "

in a number of respects , it has actually made things worse .
stripping john prescott of his departmental responsibilities but leaving him with his titles and sacking foreign secretary jack straw amid claims he had upset us president george bush over iran have angered many labour backbenchers .
similarly , promoting hardcore loyalists to the top cabinet positions and sending out messages that he has no intention of handing over power any time soon have also increased the frustration and anger from some backbenchers .
much of it is expected to come to a head at a meeting of the parliamentary labour party on monday night , although history suggests discontent at those strictly-controlled meetings is often muted .
so the question now is how the prime minister reacts to all this dissatisfaction and - if it is another show of defiance as his aides are suggesting - whether that will again see off his critics or if , this time , it will be a different story .

mr blair 's reshuffle may have made things worse for him the latest are without doubt the most serious and may yet prove to be terminal .
and the statements from downing street and loyalist mps like stephen byers and john reid that people are out to " topple " the prime minister must rank as one of the greatest statements of the obvious ever .
it is now claimed 50 labour mps are willing to sign a letter , if one is eventually finalised , giving the prime minister just a few weeks to set out a clear timetable for his departure .
the underlying threat is that , if he does not , there will indeed be an attempt to topple him probably with a leadership election at this autumn 's party conference - which many in the labour party had already expected to be his last .
intensifying pressure but it appears the main aim , excluding the " usual suspects " who do want to remove him as soon as possible , is to force the prime minister to spell out clear plans for that much-talked-of " stable and orderly transition " of power , presumably to gordon brown .

mr brown may not have plunged in the knife during his weekend interviews - he knows what happens to " natural successors " , like conservative michael heseltine , when they become assassins .
but his words have still succeeded in intensifying the pressure on the prime minister to announce a detailed timetable for his resignation .
his repeated talk of the need for " renewal in government " and " a new generation of policies " , his reference to " the next stage of my political career " and his statement that people were " looking to " the prime minister for the next move left little room for doubt about his ambitions .
but he went further , suggesting mr blair was already " talking to people " about the transition of power and that the labour party wanted that stable and orderly transition .
disappointed he even went beyond that , suggesting the party needed to listen to concerns coming from voters not only in last week 's local polls but in last year 's general election - that was immediately interpreted as a recognition that big issues such as the war in iraq and some of the prime minister 's public sector reforms were a factor in the party 's performance and may need attention .

mr blair 's reshuffle may have made things worse for him the latest are without doubt the most serious and may yet prove to be terminal .
and the statements from downing street and loyalist mps like stephen byers and john reid that people are out to " topple " the prime minister must rank as one of the greatest statements of the obvious ever .
it is now claimed 50 labour mps are willing to sign a letter , if one is eventually finalised , giving the prime minister just a few weeks to set out a clear timetable for his departure .
the underlying threat is that , if he does not , there will indeed be an attempt to topple him probably with a leadership election at this autumn 's party conference - which many in the labour party had already expected to be his last .
intensifying pressure but it appears the main aim , excluding the " usual suspects " who do want to remove him as soon as possible , is to force the prime minister to spell out clear plans for that much-talked-of " stable and orderly transition " of power , presumably to gordon brown .
so blair has shuffled the thoroughly discredited pack and come up with yet another lame duck cabinet terence phillips worcester , uk send us your comments full text : labour mps ' letter and the demands go well beyond that usual group of rebels who take every possible opportunity to demand his head .
mr brown may not have plunged in the knife during his weekend interviews - he knows what happens to " natural successors " , like conservative michael heseltine , when they become assassins .
but his words have still succeeded in intensifying the pressure on the prime minister to announce a detailed timetable for his resignation .
his repeated talk of the need for " renewal in government " and " a new generation of policies " , his reference to " the next stage of my political career " and his statement that people were " looking to " the prime minister for the next move left little room for doubt about his ambitions .
but he went further , suggesting mr blair was already " talking to people " about the transition of power and that the labour party wanted that stable and orderly transition .
disappointed he even went beyond that , suggesting the party needed to listen to concerns coming from voters not only in last week 's local polls but in last year 's general election - that was immediately interpreted as a recognition that big issues such as the war in iraq and some of the prime minister 's public sector reforms were a factor in the party 's performance and may need attention .
if he hoped his brutal cabinet reshuffle would succeed in overshadowing labour 's grim local election results and talk about his own future , he has been sorely disappointed as for the prime minister , if he hoped his brutal cabinet reshuffle would succeed in overshadowing labour 's grim local election results and talk about his own future , he has been sorely disappointed .
in a number of respects , it has actually made things worse .
stripping john prescott of his departmental responsibilities but leaving him with his titles and sacking foreign secretary jack straw amid claims he had upset us president george bush over iran have angered many labour backbenchers .
similarly , promoting hardcore loyalists to the top cabinet positions and sending out messages that he has no intention of handing over power any time soon have also increased the frustration and anger from some backbenchers .
much of it is expected to come to a head at a meeting of the parliamentary labour party on monday night , although history suggests discontent at those strictly-controlled meetings is often muted .

judge ura wangomklang said the court had decided by nine votes to five that the 2 april poll was unconstitutional .
thailand has been in political limbo since the election , which was called by prime minister thaksin shinawatra in the face of mounting protests .
the opposition boycotted the poll so not all the seats were filled , which meant parliament could not sit .
the country 's opposition parties had backed the nullification of the 2 april poll , and have said they will contest the new one .
thailand 's political crisis 23 january : thaksin sells 49.6 % family stake in telecoms company shin corp 4 february : 50,000 attend rally in bangkok demanding thaksin 's resignation ; similar rallies then continue 24 february : thaksin dissolves parliament and calls snap election 27 february : three main opposition parties say they will boycott the polls 2 april : thais vote for new government amid opposition boycott 4 april : thaksin says he will step down , depite winning 57 % of the vote , because of large protest ' no vote ' 23 april : by-elections held , but fail to resolve crisis 25 april : thai king calls on court to solve " mess " 8 may : constitutional court rules 2 april election invalid thailand 's three courts agreed to rule on the election 's validity after a rare intervention by king bhumibol adulyadej , who described the situation as a " mess " and said any parliament with no opposition presence would be undemocratic .
many analysts said that invalidating the election was the only way to move the country forward .
the crisis began when mr thaksin dissolved parliament in february , calling polls in an effort to prove he still had widespread public support despite the regular massive street protests held in bangkok .
his thai rak thai party won 57 % of the vote , but millions of thais cast protest votes and mr thaksin announced his decision to step aside a few days later .
but his departure still left many questions - including how to fill the seats left vacant because of the opposition boycott and the deep anti-thaksin sentiments in many parts of the capital and the south of the country .
two rounds of by-elections failed to resolve the issue , and when the king stepped in , calling on the judiciary to end the problem , it seemed that the only solution would be to hold fresh elections .
soon afterwards , the top judges from thailand 's three main judicial institutions - the supreme , administrative and constitutional courts - met to discuss the situation .
it is unclear what their discussions entailed , but analysts predicted that the result would be an annulment .
the king 's comments seem to have been a catalyst for action now , after considering complaints about a number of minor irregularities , the constitutional court has delivered that verdict .
the path ahead , though , is still not clear , according to the bbc south east asia correspondent jonathan head .
the opposition does not want mr thaksin to run again for prime minister , but he is considered a key vote winner for thai rak thai , which retains the support of most rural voters .
the main opposition parities , which boycotted the last poll , are also demanding constitutional reforms to strengthen the checks on the prime minister 's power .
