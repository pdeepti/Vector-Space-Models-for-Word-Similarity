one of them , the hamburg-based company power , is expecting it to be quite a challenge . " around 350 to 400 security personnel are usually required for a bundesliga game and 450 for a normal international game , " said carsten klauer , the company 's ceo .
" but that number will probably be doubled during a single world cup game . " boosting its security staff is also one of the prime concerns of the company leipziger löwen that will provide security in the saxon city of leipzig .
it plans to increase its current force of 160 to 1,500 temporarily .

what makes things worse is that the db ca n't find enough trainers from its regular pool and has to hire external trainers from private security firms for the job . no hefty profits expected despite the seemingly massive dimensions of the whole affair , the world cup is not expected to bring in hefty profits for the security industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.03.2006 berlin 's new rail " palace " nears completion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by may , these halls will become europe 's busiest train station as berlin continues to wrangle with monuments of its inglorious past , one last big post-unification project is almost finished : europe 's largest train station . in the heart of former east berlin , work has begun to tear down a relic of gdr times , the concrete monstrosity known as the palace of the republic .
not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .
the ultra-modern lines mixed with traditional proportions are typical for berlin 's post-wall architecture , in which past meets future , the station 's architects said . " the design is a cross , an intersection of east and west , past and future , " said jürgen hillmar , a partner at the firm gmp -lrb- von gerkan , marg und partner -rrb- , who is responsible for the project .
" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction . " like berlin itself . the new station , taking up 180,000 square meters -lrb- 1.9 million square feet -rrb- , will be europe 's largest hub , serving 300,000 passengers with almost 1,300 long-distance , regional and local trains passing through daily , officials say .
it will centralize train travel in the city for the first time - west-bound passengers currently use zoo station ; east-bound , lichtenberg or ostbahnhof . bildunterschrift : a model of the new station , which will have trains arriving and departing from several levels the station will also feature a three-level , 15,000 square meter shopping center that will stay open late nights and on weekends , including sunday . and officials hope it will draw the crowds and revitalize the area . " for years , that area was a desert , " baufeld said .
" but we have had 10,000 visitors annually to the site since we started building .
it is a good start to begin to develop this whole area . " rising from the ashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old station opened just in time for the first unification of germany lehrter bahnof originally opened in 1871 and was named after the first stop on the line leading to hanover , lehrte .
it was called a " palace " because of its classical and renaissance architecture and remained the key departure station in berlin for decades .
it was also a main economic engine for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . the station was severely damaged by bombing during world war ii .
while it continued to serve passengers , its importance in the divided city declined .
in 1952 , the gdr , responsible for berlin railways , decided to stop service to the station and demolition begun a few years later .
only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city .

only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city .

harald olschok , head of the federal association of german security firms -lrb- bdws -rrb- , said the industry is gearing up for the event . " it 's a huge stroke of luck for the industry , " olschok said , adding that it also posed an unprecedented challenge .

one of them , the hamburg-based company power , is expecting it to be quite a challenge . " around 350 to 400 security personnel are usually required for a bundesliga game and 450 for a normal international game , " said carsten klauer , the company 's ceo .
" but that number will probably be doubled during a single world cup game . " boosting its security staff is also one of the prime concerns of the company leipziger löwen that will provide security in the saxon city of leipzig .
it plans to increase its current force of 160 to 1,500 temporarily . " we 've worked towards that purpose together with a local labor agency that 's set up an extra world cup office , " said ramon rodriguez , in charge of world cup matters at the company , adding that he 's still looking for more people . in theory anyone between the ages of 18 and 40 can apply , provided they do n't have any prior convictions .
however they do have to undergo a security check by federal police . robots to counter logistical nightmare most security experts do n't foresee any major hiccups during the event .

the private security personnel will however not be armed . " we have the authority to expel someone , if necessary with force , from the stadium , " klauer said . despite all the elaborate preventive measures , there 's no ruling out the unexpected . " when it comes to bundesliga games , we know the routine very well , " he added .
" but it 's going to be very different at the world cup .
lots of vips , for instance , will be flown directly to the games by helicopter . " in addition , the world cup organizing committee has made it mandatory that all stadiums be secured around the clock during the world cup - a requirement that involves a huge technical and logistical challenge . klauer 's company thus plans to install a robot , both inside and outside the stadium in hamburg . " he 's outfitted with special cameras that react to motion and he can feed live pictures to the central monitor , " klauer said . special training to top it all another aspect of the mammoth process involves special training for all security personnel - as required by the world cup organization committee . germany 's railway operator , deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , is responsible for the training . " our subsidiary , db-training , will train all the 12,000 participants , " said uwe herz , a db spokesman .
" this is also about things like ' how do i appear confident and friendly ' and the like . " there 's speculation that db got the training contract because it 's the most important sponsor of the world cup .
what makes things worse is that the db ca n't find enough trainers from its regular pool and has to hire external trainers from private security firms for the job . no hefty profits expected despite the seemingly massive dimensions of the whole affair , the world cup is not expected to bring in hefty profits for the security industry . " we 're making a huge effort here , " klauer said .
" we have permanent employees here who from morning to evening do nothing else but prepare for the world cup .
but we 're definitely not going to be overpaid for that .

but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden . " hofmann added his intention was to show a british pilot confronting the devastation wrought by his bombs , and disputes claims that the romance trivializes it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional movie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden . " hofmann added his intention was to show a british pilot confronting the devastation wrought by his bombs , and disputes claims that the romance trivializes it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional movie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .
the ultra-modern lines mixed with traditional proportions are typical for berlin 's post-wall architecture , in which past meets future , the station 's architects said . " the design is a cross , an intersection of east and west , past and future , " said jürgen hillmar , a partner at the firm gmp -lrb- von gerkan , marg und partner -rrb- , who is responsible for the project .
" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction . " like berlin itself . the new station , taking up 180,000 square meters -lrb- 1.9 million square feet -rrb- , will be europe 's largest hub , serving 300,000 passengers with almost 1,300 long-distance , regional and local trains passing through daily , officials say .
it will centralize train travel in the city for the first time - west-bound passengers currently use zoo station ; east-bound , lichtenberg or ostbahnhof . bildunterschrift : a model of the new station , which will have trains arriving and departing from several levels the station will also feature a three-level , 15,000 square meter shopping center that will stay open late nights and on weekends , including sunday . and officials hope it will draw the crowds and revitalize the area . " for years , that area was a desert , " baufeld said .
" but we have had 10,000 visitors annually to the site since we started building .
it is a good start to begin to develop this whole area . " rising from the ashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old station opened just in time for the first unification of germany lehrter bahnof originally opened in 1871 and was named after the first stop on the line leading to hanover , lehrte .
it was called a " palace " because of its classical and renaissance architecture and remained the key departure station in berlin for decades .
it was also a main economic engine for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . the station was severely damaged by bombing during world war ii .
while it continued to serve passengers , its importance in the divided city declined .
in 1952 , the gdr , responsible for berlin railways , decided to stop service to the station and demolition begun a few years later .
only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .
it marks the end of an era for many berliners .

but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden . " hofmann added his intention was to show a british pilot confronting the devastation wrought by his bombs , and disputes claims that the romance trivializes it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional movie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .
the ultra-modern lines mixed with traditional proportions are typical for berlin 's post-wall architecture , in which past meets future , the station 's architects said . " the design is a cross , an intersection of east and west , past and future , " said jürgen hillmar , a partner at the firm gmp -lrb- von gerkan , marg und partner -rrb- , who is responsible for the project .
" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction . " like berlin itself . the new station , taking up 180,000 square meters -lrb- 1.9 million square feet -rrb- , will be europe 's largest hub , serving 300,000 passengers with almost 1,300 long-distance , regional and local trains passing through daily , officials say .
it will centralize train travel in the city for the first time - west-bound passengers currently use zoo station ; east-bound , lichtenberg or ostbahnhof . bildunterschrift : a model of the new station , which will have trains arriving and departing from several levels the station will also feature a three-level , 15,000 square meter shopping center that will stay open late nights and on weekends , including sunday . and officials hope it will draw the crowds and revitalize the area . " for years , that area was a desert , " baufeld said .
" but we have had 10,000 visitors annually to the site since we started building .
it is a good start to begin to develop this whole area . " rising from the ashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old station opened just in time for the first unification of germany lehrter bahnof originally opened in 1871 and was named after the first stop on the line leading to hanover , lehrte .
it was called a " palace " because of its classical and renaissance architecture and remained the key departure station in berlin for decades .
it was also a main economic engine for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . the station was severely damaged by bombing during world war ii .
while it continued to serve passengers , its importance in the divided city declined .
in 1952 , the gdr , responsible for berlin railways , decided to stop service to the station and demolition begun a few years later .
only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city .

not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .

" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction . " like berlin itself . the new station , taking up 180,000 square meters -lrb- 1.9 million square feet -rrb- , will be europe 's largest hub , serving 300,000 passengers with almost 1,300 long-distance , regional and local trains passing through daily , officials say .

it was called a " palace " because of its classical and renaissance architecture and remained the key departure station in berlin for decades .
it was also a main economic engine for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . the station was severely damaged by bombing during world war ii .
while it continued to serve passengers , its importance in the divided city declined .
in 1952 , the gdr , responsible for berlin railways , decided to stop service to the station and demolition begun a few years later .
only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on .

but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden . " hofmann added his intention was to show a british pilot confronting the devastation wrought by his bombs , and disputes claims that the romance trivializes it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional movie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.03.2006 german tv 's " dresden " drama bombs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love in the firing line : dresden 's romance storyline has critics spitting it is german television 's most expensive and lavish drama and yet critics have savaged " dresden : an inferno " as a missed opportunity with a maudlin , improbable love story at its heart . it was never going to be an easy job to make a slick and critically acclaimed two-part television drama about one of the most controversial bombing raids of world war ii .
but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden . " hofmann added his intention was to show a british pilot confronting the devastation wrought by his bombs , and disputes claims that the romance trivializes it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional movie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .

but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden . " hofmann added his intention was to show a british pilot confronting the devastation wrought by his bombs , and disputes claims that the romance trivializes it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional movie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.03.2006 berlin 's new rail " palace " nears completion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by may , these halls will become europe 's busiest train station as berlin continues to wrangle with monuments of its inglorious past , one last big post-unification project is almost finished : europe 's largest train station . in the heart of former east berlin , work has begun to tear down a relic of gdr times , the concrete monstrosity known as the palace of the republic .
not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .
the ultra-modern lines mixed with traditional proportions are typical for berlin 's post-wall architecture , in which past meets future , the station 's architects said . " the design is a cross , an intersection of east and west , past and future , " said jürgen hillmar , a partner at the firm gmp -lrb- von gerkan , marg und partner -rrb- , who is responsible for the project .
" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction . " like berlin itself . the new station , taking up 180,000 square meters -lrb- 1.9 million square feet -rrb- , will be europe 's largest hub , serving 300,000 passengers with almost 1,300 long-distance , regional and local trains passing through daily , officials say .
it will centralize train travel in the city for the first time - west-bound passengers currently use zoo station ; east-bound , lichtenberg or ostbahnhof . bildunterschrift : a model of the new station , which will have trains arriving and departing from several levels the station will also feature a three-level , 15,000 square meter shopping center that will stay open late nights and on weekends , including sunday . and officials hope it will draw the crowds and revitalize the area . " for years , that area was a desert , " baufeld said .
" but we have had 10,000 visitors annually to the site since we started building .
it is a good start to begin to develop this whole area . " rising from the ashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old station opened just in time for the first unification of germany lehrter bahnof originally opened in 1871 and was named after the first stop on the line leading to hanover , lehrte .
it was called a " palace " because of its classical and renaissance architecture and remained the key departure station in berlin for decades .
it was also a main economic engine for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . the station was severely damaged by bombing during world war ii .
while it continued to serve passengers , its importance in the divided city declined .
in 1952 , the gdr , responsible for berlin railways , decided to stop service to the station and demolition begun a few years later .
only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .
it marks the end of an era for many berliners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.03.2006 german tv 's " dresden " drama bombs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love in the firing line : dresden 's romance storyline has critics spitting it is german television 's most expensive and lavish drama and yet critics have savaged " dresden : an inferno " as a missed opportunity with a maudlin , improbable love story at its heart . it was never going to be an easy job to make a slick and critically acclaimed two-part television drama about one of the most controversial bombing raids of world war ii .
but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden . " hofmann added his intention was to show a british pilot confronting the devastation wrought by his bombs , and disputes claims that the romance trivializes it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional movie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden . " hofmann added his intention was to show a british pilot confronting the devastation wrought by his bombs , and disputes claims that the romance trivializes it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional movie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

an investigation will almost certainly now go ahead . the decision taken by germany 's opposition liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- monday to back the green party and the left party left-wing alliance in calling for a parliamentary inquiry into allegations that german spies helped the us-led invasion of iraq has cleared the way for an official probe . with the three main opposition parties all in agreement , chancellor angela merkel 's government is almost certain to face an embarrassing enquiry which could undermine the country ’ s security services and hobble merkel 's attempts to improve relations with the united states . the combined votes of the fdp , the greens and the left party are enough to force an investigation in which current and former officials - including current and former cabinet ministers - would have to testify under oath . an investigation of this magnitude will almost certainly cast the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in a bad light and could also lead to its influence and standing with overseas counterparts being damaged . liberals want accountability not a witch hunt but the fdp 's interior minister max stadler told the german parliament on monday that the decision came from a need for transparency and not from the desire for a witch hunt .
" we don ’ t want an investigating committee against the federal intelligence service , but a debate about political responsibility , " stadler said . however , others could not see a seperation between the inquiry and potential damage to the bnd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd are not being hunted as a scapegoat , the fdp claims " it has implications for the functions of the bnd .

" even after the meeting of the supervisory committee on monday , i have no reason to believe that we no longer want and need a parliamentary probe into the bnd 's activities .

however , the government has been forced to change its story that the agents only provided information on schools , hospitals and other civilian targets that must not be bombed after the publication of a report on feb .

but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden . " hofmann added his intention was to show a british pilot confronting the devastation wrought by his bombs , and disputes claims that the romance trivializes it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional movie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .
the ultra-modern lines mixed with traditional proportions are typical for berlin 's post-wall architecture , in which past meets future , the station 's architects said . " the design is a cross , an intersection of east and west , past and future , " said jürgen hillmar , a partner at the firm gmp -lrb- von gerkan , marg und partner -rrb- , who is responsible for the project .
" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction . " like berlin itself . the new station , taking up 180,000 square meters -lrb- 1.9 million square feet -rrb- , will be europe 's largest hub , serving 300,000 passengers with almost 1,300 long-distance , regional and local trains passing through daily , officials say .
it will centralize train travel in the city for the first time - west-bound passengers currently use zoo station ; east-bound , lichtenberg or ostbahnhof . bildunterschrift : a model of the new station , which will have trains arriving and departing from several levels the station will also feature a three-level , 15,000 square meter shopping center that will stay open late nights and on weekends , including sunday . and officials hope it will draw the crowds and revitalize the area . " for years , that area was a desert , " baufeld said .
" but we have had 10,000 visitors annually to the site since we started building .
it is a good start to begin to develop this whole area . " rising from the ashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old station opened just in time for the first unification of germany lehrter bahnof originally opened in 1871 and was named after the first stop on the line leading to hanover , lehrte .
it was called a " palace " because of its classical and renaissance architecture and remained the key departure station in berlin for decades .
it was also a main economic engine for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . the station was severely damaged by bombing during world war ii .
while it continued to serve passengers , its importance in the divided city declined .
in 1952 , the gdr , responsible for berlin railways , decided to stop service to the station and demolition begun a few years later .
only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .

an investigation will almost certainly now go ahead . the decision taken by germany 's opposition liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- monday to back the green party and the left party left-wing alliance in calling for a parliamentary inquiry into allegations that german spies helped the us-led invasion of iraq has cleared the way for an official probe . with the three main opposition parties all in agreement , chancellor angela merkel 's government is almost certain to face an embarrassing enquiry which could undermine the country ’ s security services and hobble merkel 's attempts to improve relations with the united states . the combined votes of the fdp , the greens and the left party are enough to force an investigation in which current and former officials - including current and former cabinet ministers - would have to testify under oath . an investigation of this magnitude will almost certainly cast the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in a bad light and could also lead to its influence and standing with overseas counterparts being damaged . liberals want accountability not a witch hunt but the fdp 's interior minister max stadler told the german parliament on monday that the decision came from a need for transparency and not from the desire for a witch hunt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.03.2006 berlin 's new rail " palace " nears completion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by may , these halls will become europe 's busiest train station as berlin continues to wrangle with monuments of its inglorious past , one last big post-unification project is almost finished : europe 's largest train station . in the heart of former east berlin , work has begun to tear down a relic of gdr times , the concrete monstrosity known as the palace of the republic .
not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .
the ultra-modern lines mixed with traditional proportions are typical for berlin 's post-wall architecture , in which past meets future , the station 's architects said . " the design is a cross , an intersection of east and west , past and future , " said jürgen hillmar , a partner at the firm gmp -lrb- von gerkan , marg und partner -rrb- , who is responsible for the project .
" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction . " like berlin itself . the new station , taking up 180,000 square meters -lrb- 1.9 million square feet -rrb- , will be europe 's largest hub , serving 300,000 passengers with almost 1,300 long-distance , regional and local trains passing through daily , officials say .
it will centralize train travel in the city for the first time - west-bound passengers currently use zoo station ; east-bound , lichtenberg or ostbahnhof . bildunterschrift : a model of the new station , which will have trains arriving and departing from several levels the station will also feature a three-level , 15,000 square meter shopping center that will stay open late nights and on weekends , including sunday . and officials hope it will draw the crowds and revitalize the area . " for years , that area was a desert , " baufeld said .
" but we have had 10,000 visitors annually to the site since we started building .
it is a good start to begin to develop this whole area . " rising from the ashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old station opened just in time for the first unification of germany lehrter bahnof originally opened in 1871 and was named after the first stop on the line leading to hanover , lehrte .
it was called a " palace " because of its classical and renaissance architecture and remained the key departure station in berlin for decades .
it was also a main economic engine for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . the station was severely damaged by bombing during world war ii .
while it continued to serve passengers , its importance in the divided city declined .
in 1952 , the gdr , responsible for berlin railways , decided to stop service to the station and demolition begun a few years later .
only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .
it marks the end of an era for many berliners .

only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city .

" tanks in the vicinity of stadiums : that would certainly be unacceptable , " theo zwanziger , the president of the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , recently said in an interview .
" we want people to hug each other .
if tanks are stationed in the background - even as a preventive measure - it just would n't work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police are n't going to manage on their own even as uncertainty surrounds the deployment of the german army during the world cup , one thing 's clear : germany 's police forces will be overstretched because organizers are expecting more than seven million visitors to descend on the country for the mega event . this is where private security firms are expected to step in .
harald olschok , head of the federal association of german security firms -lrb- bdws -rrb- , said the industry is gearing up for the event . " it 's a huge stroke of luck for the industry , " olschok said , adding that it also posed an unprecedented challenge .
" for a relatively short period of six weeks there 's going to be a huge demand : around 12,000 security personnel will have to be deployed .
we 're not going to manage that with our regular forces . " boosting existing security ranks private security firms will play a big role particularly when it comes to providing security for the 32 team quarters and in the downtown areas in 12 german cities where the games will take place .
in addition , they 'll also take over security for live game broadcasts on huge public screens across germany . " the games will be broadcast on huge screens in at least 200 cities , " olschok said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : providing security for live coverage of games on massive screens is a challenge the so-called " public viewing zones " are considered particularly sensitive areas from a security point of view .
on the strasse des 17 .
juni - one of berlin 's main boulevards - alone authorities expect more than 100,000 fans to turn up for the screenings . security firms that regularly work for the german league or bundesliga soccer games will largely secure the downtown areas of the cities where the world cup games will take place .
one of them , the hamburg-based company power , is expecting it to be quite a challenge . " around 350 to 400 security personnel are usually required for a bundesliga game and 450 for a normal international game , " said carsten klauer , the company 's ceo .
" but that number will probably be doubled during a single world cup game . " boosting its security staff is also one of the prime concerns of the company leipziger löwen that will provide security in the saxon city of leipzig .
it plans to increase its current force of 160 to 1,500 temporarily . " we 've worked towards that purpose together with a local labor agency that 's set up an extra world cup office , " said ramon rodriguez , in charge of world cup matters at the company , adding that he 's still looking for more people . in theory anyone between the ages of 18 and 40 can apply , provided they do n't have any prior convictions .
however they do have to undergo a security check by federal police . robots to counter logistical nightmare most security experts do n't foresee any major hiccups during the event . " in light of the stringent measures such as only letting in persons in the stadiums whose names are already known , we assume that we 'll have almost perfect security in the stadiums , " olschok said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police in riot gear in a stadium hooligans will find it tough getting access and if riots did take place , the police would be standing prepared in the background .
the private security personnel will however not be armed . " we have the authority to expel someone , if necessary with force , from the stadium , " klauer said . despite all the elaborate preventive measures , there 's no ruling out the unexpected . " when it comes to bundesliga games , we know the routine very well , " he added .
" but it 's going to be very different at the world cup .
lots of vips , for instance , will be flown directly to the games by helicopter . " in addition , the world cup organizing committee has made it mandatory that all stadiums be secured around the clock during the world cup - a requirement that involves a huge technical and logistical challenge . klauer 's company thus plans to install a robot , both inside and outside the stadium in hamburg . " he 's outfitted with special cameras that react to motion and he can feed live pictures to the central monitor , " klauer said . special training to top it all another aspect of the mammoth process involves special training for all security personnel - as required by the world cup organization committee . germany 's railway operator , deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , is responsible for the training . " our subsidiary , db-training , will train all the 12,000 participants , " said uwe herz , a db spokesman .
" this is also about things like ' how do i appear confident and friendly ' and the like . " there 's speculation that db got the training contract because it 's the most important sponsor of the world cup .
what makes things worse is that the db ca n't find enough trainers from its regular pool and has to hire external trainers from private security firms for the job . no hefty profits expected despite the seemingly massive dimensions of the whole affair , the world cup is not expected to bring in hefty profits for the security industry . " we 're making a huge effort here , " klauer said .
" we have permanent employees here who from morning to evening do nothing else but prepare for the world cup .

" tanks in the vicinity of stadiums : that would certainly be unacceptable , " theo zwanziger , the president of the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , recently said in an interview .
" we want people to hug each other .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police are n't going to manage on their own even as uncertainty surrounds the deployment of the german army during the world cup , one thing 's clear : germany 's police forces will be overstretched because organizers are expecting more than seven million visitors to descend on the country for the mega event . this is where private security firms are expected to step in .
harald olschok , head of the federal association of german security firms -lrb- bdws -rrb- , said the industry is gearing up for the event . " it 's a huge stroke of luck for the industry , " olschok said , adding that it also posed an unprecedented challenge .
" for a relatively short period of six weeks there 's going to be a huge demand : around 12,000 security personnel will have to be deployed .
we 're not going to manage that with our regular forces . " boosting existing security ranks private security firms will play a big role particularly when it comes to providing security for the 32 team quarters and in the downtown areas in 12 german cities where the games will take place .
in addition , they 'll also take over security for live game broadcasts on huge public screens across germany . " the games will be broadcast on huge screens in at least 200 cities , " olschok said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : providing security for live coverage of games on massive screens is a challenge the so-called " public viewing zones " are considered particularly sensitive areas from a security point of view .

juni - one of berlin 's main boulevards - alone authorities expect more than 100,000 fans to turn up for the screenings . security firms that regularly work for the german league or bundesliga soccer games will largely secure the downtown areas of the cities where the world cup games will take place .
one of them , the hamburg-based company power , is expecting it to be quite a challenge . " around 350 to 400 security personnel are usually required for a bundesliga game and 450 for a normal international game , " said carsten klauer , the company 's ceo .
" but that number will probably be doubled during a single world cup game . " boosting its security staff is also one of the prime concerns of the company leipziger löwen that will provide security in the saxon city of leipzig .
it plans to increase its current force of 160 to 1,500 temporarily . " we 've worked towards that purpose together with a local labor agency that 's set up an extra world cup office , " said ramon rodriguez , in charge of world cup matters at the company , adding that he 's still looking for more people . in theory anyone between the ages of 18 and 40 can apply , provided they do n't have any prior convictions .
however they do have to undergo a security check by federal police . robots to counter logistical nightmare most security experts do n't foresee any major hiccups during the event .

" in addition , the world cup organizing committee has made it mandatory that all stadiums be secured around the clock during the world cup - a requirement that involves a huge technical and logistical challenge . klauer 's company thus plans to install a robot , both inside and outside the stadium in hamburg . " he 's outfitted with special cameras that react to motion and he can feed live pictures to the central monitor , " klauer said . special training to top it all another aspect of the mammoth process involves special training for all security personnel - as required by the world cup organization committee . germany 's railway operator , deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , is responsible for the training .

" but that number will probably be doubled during a single world cup game . " boosting its security staff is also one of the prime concerns of the company leipziger löwen that will provide security in the saxon city of leipzig .
it plans to increase its current force of 160 to 1,500 temporarily . " we 've worked towards that purpose together with a local labor agency that 's set up an extra world cup office , " said ramon rodriguez , in charge of world cup matters at the company , adding that he 's still looking for more people . in theory anyone between the ages of 18 and 40 can apply , provided they do n't have any prior convictions .
however they do have to undergo a security check by federal police . robots to counter logistical nightmare most security experts do n't foresee any major hiccups during the event . " in light of the stringent measures such as only letting in persons in the stadiums whose names are already known , we assume that we 'll have almost perfect security in the stadiums , " olschok said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police in riot gear in a stadium hooligans will find it tough getting access and if riots did take place , the police would be standing prepared in the background .
the private security personnel will however not be armed . " we have the authority to expel someone , if necessary with force , from the stadium , " klauer said . despite all the elaborate preventive measures , there 's no ruling out the unexpected . " when it comes to bundesliga games , we know the routine very well , " he added .
" but it 's going to be very different at the world cup .
lots of vips , for instance , will be flown directly to the games by helicopter . " in addition , the world cup organizing committee has made it mandatory that all stadiums be secured around the clock during the world cup - a requirement that involves a huge technical and logistical challenge . klauer 's company thus plans to install a robot , both inside and outside the stadium in hamburg . " he 's outfitted with special cameras that react to motion and he can feed live pictures to the central monitor , " klauer said . special training to top it all another aspect of the mammoth process involves special training for all security personnel - as required by the world cup organization committee . germany 's railway operator , deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , is responsible for the training . " our subsidiary , db-training , will train all the 12,000 participants , " said uwe herz , a db spokesman .
" this is also about things like ' how do i appear confident and friendly ' and the like . " there 's speculation that db got the training contract because it 's the most important sponsor of the world cup .
what makes things worse is that the db ca n't find enough trainers from its regular pool and has to hire external trainers from private security firms for the job . no hefty profits expected despite the seemingly massive dimensions of the whole affair , the world cup is not expected to bring in hefty profits for the security industry . " we 're making a huge effort here , " klauer said .
" we have permanent employees here who from morning to evening do nothing else but prepare for the world cup .
but we 're definitely not going to be overpaid for that .

but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden .

not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .

but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden . " hofmann added his intention was to show a british pilot confronting the devastation wrought by his bombs , and disputes claims that the romance trivializes it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional movie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .
the ultra-modern lines mixed with traditional proportions are typical for berlin 's post-wall architecture , in which past meets future , the station 's architects said . " the design is a cross , an intersection of east and west , past and future , " said jürgen hillmar , a partner at the firm gmp -lrb- von gerkan , marg und partner -rrb- , who is responsible for the project .
" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction .

not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .
the ultra-modern lines mixed with traditional proportions are typical for berlin 's post-wall architecture , in which past meets future , the station 's architects said . " the design is a cross , an intersection of east and west , past and future , " said jürgen hillmar , a partner at the firm gmp -lrb- von gerkan , marg und partner -rrb- , who is responsible for the project .
" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction . " like berlin itself . the new station , taking up 180,000 square meters -lrb- 1.9 million square feet -rrb- , will be europe 's largest hub , serving 300,000 passengers with almost 1,300 long-distance , regional and local trains passing through daily , officials say .
it will centralize train travel in the city for the first time - west-bound passengers currently use zoo station ; east-bound , lichtenberg or ostbahnhof . bildunterschrift : a model of the new station , which will have trains arriving and departing from several levels the station will also feature a three-level , 15,000 square meter shopping center that will stay open late nights and on weekends , including sunday . and officials hope it will draw the crowds and revitalize the area . " for years , that area was a desert , " baufeld said .
" but we have had 10,000 visitors annually to the site since we started building .
it is a good start to begin to develop this whole area . " rising from the ashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old station opened just in time for the first unification of germany lehrter bahnof originally opened in 1871 and was named after the first stop on the line leading to hanover , lehrte .
it was called a " palace " because of its classical and renaissance architecture and remained the key departure station in berlin for decades .
it was also a main economic engine for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . the station was severely damaged by bombing during world war ii .
while it continued to serve passengers , its importance in the divided city declined .
in 1952 , the gdr , responsible for berlin railways , decided to stop service to the station and demolition begun a few years later .
only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city .

an investigation will almost certainly now go ahead . the decision taken by germany 's opposition liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- monday to back the green party and the left party left-wing alliance in calling for a parliamentary inquiry into allegations that german spies helped the us-led invasion of iraq has cleared the way for an official probe . with the three main opposition parties all in agreement , chancellor angela merkel 's government is almost certain to face an embarrassing enquiry which could undermine the country ’ s security services and hobble merkel 's attempts to improve relations with the united states . the combined votes of the fdp , the greens and the left party are enough to force an investigation in which current and former officials - including current and former cabinet ministers - would have to testify under oath . an investigation of this magnitude will almost certainly cast the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in a bad light and could also lead to its influence and standing with overseas counterparts being damaged . liberals want accountability not a witch hunt but the fdp 's interior minister max stadler told the german parliament on monday that the decision came from a need for transparency and not from the desire for a witch hunt .
" we don ’ t want an investigating committee against the federal intelligence service , but a debate about political responsibility , " stadler said . however , others could not see a seperation between the inquiry and potential damage to the bnd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd are not being hunted as a scapegoat , the fdp claims " it has implications for the functions of the bnd .
we do depend in some areas of the world on international cooperation with other secret services , and being dragged into the limelight of public debate is not really helpful , " eberhard sandschneider , head of the german council on foreign relations , told reuters . hans-christian ströbele , spokesman for the greens , once more voiced his support for an inquiry and called for the bnd to be investigated . " even after the meeting of the supervisory committee on monday , i have no reason to believe that we no longer want and need a parliamentary probe into the bnd 's activities .
i simply do not agree with the assessment given by the social and christian democrats . " an investigation into the involvement of bnd agents in pinpointing targets in baghdad for us military air strikes could be the least of the government 's problems . inquiry could open can of security worms an inquiry could push for an opening of files on many other aspects of german-us security cooperation , including the alleged abduction of a german national to afghanistan by the cia , as well as revelations that german security officials accepted a us invitation to question two inmates at the guantanamo bay detention camp . the fact that two bnd agents were in baghdad at the start of the us invasion in march 2003 was confirmed in the initial report by a parliamentary control committee but there was no evidence that the agents were helping the us war effort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd agents did pass on information but were military targets named ?
however , the government has been forced to change its story that the agents only provided information on schools , hospitals and other civilian targets that must not be bombed after the publication of a report on feb .
24 that stated that the agents also provided some descriptions of the police and military presence in baghdad , including geographic coordinates . while the investigation may put possible strains on berlin 's relationship with washington , chancellor merkel herself is in no direct political danger from an inquiry as she was in opposition with her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party at the time . spd coalition ministers face uncomfortable time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will have to explain his involvement to any inquiry the same can not be said for current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier who was former social democrat chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff during the iraq war and therefore the man responsible for overseeing the security services . other politicians who are still in prominent positions after serving in the previous red-green coalition government may also feel the heat . public and political anger at perceived duplicity the social democrats and greens won a second term on the back of schröder 's vehement opposition to the iraq war ; a stance which has come into question after the allegations that bnd agents were aiding the us at the start of the invasion came to light . politicians and members of the public alike have been incensed by the possibility that schröder 's government was condemning us bombing raids even as german agents were guiding them , a claim spd ministers have catergorically denied . social democrat minister olaf scholz said there was nothing to prove that bnd agents had acted against the former government ’ s policy line of being categorically opposed to the war in iraq . " there ’ s no evidence whatsoever that any information about the iraqi regime ’ s defence plans was collected by german intelligence agents , nor was anything ever passed on to the us military , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german opposition seems set to call for inquiry over bnd affair all three german opposition parties are likely to back a parliamentary inquiry about the role played by german intelligence agents in the war against terror and the us-led invasion of iraq , according to a report .

not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .
the ultra-modern lines mixed with traditional proportions are typical for berlin 's post-wall architecture , in which past meets future , the station 's architects said . " the design is a cross , an intersection of east and west , past and future , " said jürgen hillmar , a partner at the firm gmp -lrb- von gerkan , marg und partner -rrb- , who is responsible for the project .
" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction . " like berlin itself . the new station , taking up 180,000 square meters -lrb- 1.9 million square feet -rrb- , will be europe 's largest hub , serving 300,000 passengers with almost 1,300 long-distance , regional and local trains passing through daily , officials say .
it will centralize train travel in the city for the first time - west-bound passengers currently use zoo station ; east-bound , lichtenberg or ostbahnhof . bildunterschrift : a model of the new station , which will have trains arriving and departing from several levels the station will also feature a three-level , 15,000 square meter shopping center that will stay open late nights and on weekends , including sunday . and officials hope it will draw the crowds and revitalize the area . " for years , that area was a desert , " baufeld said .
" but we have had 10,000 visitors annually to the site since we started building .
it is a good start to begin to develop this whole area . " rising from the ashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old station opened just in time for the first unification of germany lehrter bahnof originally opened in 1871 and was named after the first stop on the line leading to hanover , lehrte .
it was called a " palace " because of its classical and renaissance architecture and remained the key departure station in berlin for decades .
it was also a main economic engine for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . the station was severely damaged by bombing during world war ii .
while it continued to serve passengers , its importance in the divided city declined .
in 1952 , the gdr , responsible for berlin railways , decided to stop service to the station and demolition begun a few years later .
only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city .

but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden . " hofmann added his intention was to show a british pilot confronting the devastation wrought by his bombs , and disputes claims that the romance trivializes it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional movie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

an investigation will almost certainly now go ahead . the decision taken by germany 's opposition liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- monday to back the green party and the left party left-wing alliance in calling for a parliamentary inquiry into allegations that german spies helped the us-led invasion of iraq has cleared the way for an official probe . with the three main opposition parties all in agreement , chancellor angela merkel 's government is almost certain to face an embarrassing enquiry which could undermine the country ’ s security services and hobble merkel 's attempts to improve relations with the united states . the combined votes of the fdp , the greens and the left party are enough to force an investigation in which current and former officials - including current and former cabinet ministers - would have to testify under oath . an investigation of this magnitude will almost certainly cast the federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in a bad light and could also lead to its influence and standing with overseas counterparts being damaged . liberals want accountability not a witch hunt but the fdp 's interior minister max stadler told the german parliament on monday that the decision came from a need for transparency and not from the desire for a witch hunt .
" we don ’ t want an investigating committee against the federal intelligence service , but a debate about political responsibility , " stadler said . however , others could not see a seperation between the inquiry and potential damage to the bnd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd are not being hunted as a scapegoat , the fdp claims " it has implications for the functions of the bnd .
we do depend in some areas of the world on international cooperation with other secret services , and being dragged into the limelight of public debate is not really helpful , " eberhard sandschneider , head of the german council on foreign relations , told reuters . hans-christian ströbele , spokesman for the greens , once more voiced his support for an inquiry and called for the bnd to be investigated . " even after the meeting of the supervisory committee on monday , i have no reason to believe that we no longer want and need a parliamentary probe into the bnd 's activities .
i simply do not agree with the assessment given by the social and christian democrats . " an investigation into the involvement of bnd agents in pinpointing targets in baghdad for us military air strikes could be the least of the government 's problems . inquiry could open can of security worms an inquiry could push for an opening of files on many other aspects of german-us security cooperation , including the alleged abduction of a german national to afghanistan by the cia , as well as revelations that german security officials accepted a us invitation to question two inmates at the guantanamo bay detention camp . the fact that two bnd agents were in baghdad at the start of the us invasion in march 2003 was confirmed in the initial report by a parliamentary control committee but there was no evidence that the agents were helping the us war effort . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd agents did pass on information but were military targets named ?
however , the government has been forced to change its story that the agents only provided information on schools , hospitals and other civilian targets that must not be bombed after the publication of a report on feb .
24 that stated that the agents also provided some descriptions of the police and military presence in baghdad , including geographic coordinates . while the investigation may put possible strains on berlin 's relationship with washington , chancellor merkel herself is in no direct political danger from an inquiry as she was in opposition with her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party at the time . spd coalition ministers face uncomfortable time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will have to explain his involvement to any inquiry the same can not be said for current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier who was former social democrat chancellor gerhard schröder 's chief of staff during the iraq war and therefore the man responsible for overseeing the security services . other politicians who are still in prominent positions after serving in the previous red-green coalition government may also feel the heat . public and political anger at perceived duplicity the social democrats and greens won a second term on the back of schröder 's vehement opposition to the iraq war ; a stance which has come into question after the allegations that bnd agents were aiding the us at the start of the invasion came to light . politicians and members of the public alike have been incensed by the possibility that schröder 's government was condemning us bombing raids even as german agents were guiding them , a claim spd ministers have catergorically denied . social democrat minister olaf scholz said there was nothing to prove that bnd agents had acted against the former government ’ s policy line of being categorically opposed to the war in iraq . " there ’ s no evidence whatsoever that any information about the iraqi regime ’ s defence plans was collected by german intelligence agents , nor was anything ever passed on to the us military , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german opposition seems set to call for inquiry over bnd affair all three german opposition parties are likely to back a parliamentary inquiry about the role played by german intelligence agents in the war against terror and the us-led invasion of iraq , according to a report .

not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .
the ultra-modern lines mixed with traditional proportions are typical for berlin 's post-wall architecture , in which past meets future , the station 's architects said . " the design is a cross , an intersection of east and west , past and future , " said jürgen hillmar , a partner at the firm gmp -lrb- von gerkan , marg und partner -rrb- , who is responsible for the project .
" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction . " like berlin itself . the new station , taking up 180,000 square meters -lrb- 1.9 million square feet -rrb- , will be europe 's largest hub , serving 300,000 passengers with almost 1,300 long-distance , regional and local trains passing through daily , officials say .
it will centralize train travel in the city for the first time - west-bound passengers currently use zoo station ; east-bound , lichtenberg or ostbahnhof . bildunterschrift : a model of the new station , which will have trains arriving and departing from several levels the station will also feature a three-level , 15,000 square meter shopping center that will stay open late nights and on weekends , including sunday . and officials hope it will draw the crowds and revitalize the area . " for years , that area was a desert , " baufeld said .
" but we have had 10,000 visitors annually to the site since we started building .
it is a good start to begin to develop this whole area . " rising from the ashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old station opened just in time for the first unification of germany lehrter bahnof originally opened in 1871 and was named after the first stop on the line leading to hanover , lehrte .
it was called a " palace " because of its classical and renaissance architecture and remained the key departure station in berlin for decades .
it was also a main economic engine for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . the station was severely damaged by bombing during world war ii .
while it continued to serve passengers , its importance in the divided city declined .
in 1952 , the gdr , responsible for berlin railways , decided to stop service to the station and demolition begun a few years later .
only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.03.2006 berlin 's new rail " palace " nears completion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by may , these halls will become europe 's busiest train station as berlin continues to wrangle with monuments of its inglorious past , one last big post-unification project is almost finished : europe 's largest train station . in the heart of former east berlin , work has begun to tear down a relic of gdr times , the concrete monstrosity known as the palace of the republic .
not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .
the ultra-modern lines mixed with traditional proportions are typical for berlin 's post-wall architecture , in which past meets future , the station 's architects said . " the design is a cross , an intersection of east and west , past and future , " said jürgen hillmar , a partner at the firm gmp -lrb- von gerkan , marg und partner -rrb- , who is responsible for the project .
" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction . " like berlin itself . the new station , taking up 180,000 square meters -lrb- 1.9 million square feet -rrb- , will be europe 's largest hub , serving 300,000 passengers with almost 1,300 long-distance , regional and local trains passing through daily , officials say .
it will centralize train travel in the city for the first time - west-bound passengers currently use zoo station ; east-bound , lichtenberg or ostbahnhof . bildunterschrift : a model of the new station , which will have trains arriving and departing from several levels the station will also feature a three-level , 15,000 square meter shopping center that will stay open late nights and on weekends , including sunday . and officials hope it will draw the crowds and revitalize the area . " for years , that area was a desert , " baufeld said .
" but we have had 10,000 visitors annually to the site since we started building .
it is a good start to begin to develop this whole area . " rising from the ashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old station opened just in time for the first unification of germany lehrter bahnof originally opened in 1871 and was named after the first stop on the line leading to hanover , lehrte .
it was called a " palace " because of its classical and renaissance architecture and remained the key departure station in berlin for decades .
it was also a main economic engine for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . the station was severely damaged by bombing during world war ii .
while it continued to serve passengers , its importance in the divided city declined .
in 1952 , the gdr , responsible for berlin railways , decided to stop service to the station and demolition begun a few years later .
only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de derailing an icon of west berlin german rail has announced that starting next may , long-distance trains will no longer stop at berlin 's zoo station , once west berlin 's primary train terminal .
it marks the end of an era for many berliners .
-lrb- july 14 , 2005 -rrb- in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .

but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden . " hofmann added his intention was to show a british pilot confronting the devastation wrought by his bombs , and disputes claims that the romance trivializes it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional movie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .
the ultra-modern lines mixed with traditional proportions are typical for berlin 's post-wall architecture , in which past meets future , the station 's architects said . " the design is a cross , an intersection of east and west , past and future , " said jürgen hillmar , a partner at the firm gmp -lrb- von gerkan , marg und partner -rrb- , who is responsible for the project .
" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction . " like berlin itself . the new station , taking up 180,000 square meters -lrb- 1.9 million square feet -rrb- , will be europe 's largest hub , serving 300,000 passengers with almost 1,300 long-distance , regional and local trains passing through daily , officials say .
it will centralize train travel in the city for the first time - west-bound passengers currently use zoo station ; east-bound , lichtenberg or ostbahnhof . bildunterschrift : a model of the new station , which will have trains arriving and departing from several levels the station will also feature a three-level , 15,000 square meter shopping center that will stay open late nights and on weekends , including sunday . and officials hope it will draw the crowds and revitalize the area . " for years , that area was a desert , " baufeld said .
" but we have had 10,000 visitors annually to the site since we started building .
it is a good start to begin to develop this whole area . " rising from the ashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old station opened just in time for the first unification of germany lehrter bahnof originally opened in 1871 and was named after the first stop on the line leading to hanover , lehrte .
it was called a " palace " because of its classical and renaissance architecture and remained the key departure station in berlin for decades .
it was also a main economic engine for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . the station was severely damaged by bombing during world war ii .
while it continued to serve passengers , its importance in the divided city declined .
in 1952 , the gdr , responsible for berlin railways , decided to stop service to the station and demolition begun a few years later .
only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city .

" tanks in the vicinity of stadiums : that would certainly be unacceptable , " theo zwanziger , the president of the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , recently said in an interview .
" we want people to hug each other .
if tanks are stationed in the background - even as a preventive measure - it just would n't work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police are n't going to manage on their own even as uncertainty surrounds the deployment of the german army during the world cup , one thing 's clear : germany 's police forces will be overstretched because organizers are expecting more than seven million visitors to descend on the country for the mega event . this is where private security firms are expected to step in .
harald olschok , head of the federal association of german security firms -lrb- bdws -rrb- , said the industry is gearing up for the event . " it 's a huge stroke of luck for the industry , " olschok said , adding that it also posed an unprecedented challenge .
" for a relatively short period of six weeks there 's going to be a huge demand : around 12,000 security personnel will have to be deployed .
we 're not going to manage that with our regular forces . " boosting existing security ranks private security firms will play a big role particularly when it comes to providing security for the 32 team quarters and in the downtown areas in 12 german cities where the games will take place .
in addition , they 'll also take over security for live game broadcasts on huge public screens across germany . " the games will be broadcast on huge screens in at least 200 cities , " olschok said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : providing security for live coverage of games on massive screens is a challenge the so-called " public viewing zones " are considered particularly sensitive areas from a security point of view .
on the strasse des 17 .
juni - one of berlin 's main boulevards - alone authorities expect more than 100,000 fans to turn up for the screenings . security firms that regularly work for the german league or bundesliga soccer games will largely secure the downtown areas of the cities where the world cup games will take place .
one of them , the hamburg-based company power , is expecting it to be quite a challenge . " around 350 to 400 security personnel are usually required for a bundesliga game and 450 for a normal international game , " said carsten klauer , the company 's ceo .
" but that number will probably be doubled during a single world cup game . " boosting its security staff is also one of the prime concerns of the company leipziger löwen that will provide security in the saxon city of leipzig .
it plans to increase its current force of 160 to 1,500 temporarily . " we 've worked towards that purpose together with a local labor agency that 's set up an extra world cup office , " said ramon rodriguez , in charge of world cup matters at the company , adding that he 's still looking for more people . in theory anyone between the ages of 18 and 40 can apply , provided they do n't have any prior convictions .
however they do have to undergo a security check by federal police . robots to counter logistical nightmare most security experts do n't foresee any major hiccups during the event . " in light of the stringent measures such as only letting in persons in the stadiums whose names are already known , we assume that we 'll have almost perfect security in the stadiums , " olschok said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police in riot gear in a stadium hooligans will find it tough getting access and if riots did take place , the police would be standing prepared in the background .
the private security personnel will however not be armed . " we have the authority to expel someone , if necessary with force , from the stadium , " klauer said . despite all the elaborate preventive measures , there 's no ruling out the unexpected . " when it comes to bundesliga games , we know the routine very well , " he added .
" but it 's going to be very different at the world cup .
lots of vips , for instance , will be flown directly to the games by helicopter . " in addition , the world cup organizing committee has made it mandatory that all stadiums be secured around the clock during the world cup - a requirement that involves a huge technical and logistical challenge . klauer 's company thus plans to install a robot , both inside and outside the stadium in hamburg . " he 's outfitted with special cameras that react to motion and he can feed live pictures to the central monitor , " klauer said . special training to top it all another aspect of the mammoth process involves special training for all security personnel - as required by the world cup organization committee . germany 's railway operator , deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , is responsible for the training . " our subsidiary , db-training , will train all the 12,000 participants , " said uwe herz , a db spokesman .
" this is also about things like ' how do i appear confident and friendly ' and the like . " there 's speculation that db got the training contract because it 's the most important sponsor of the world cup .
what makes things worse is that the db ca n't find enough trainers from its regular pool and has to hire external trainers from private security firms for the job . no hefty profits expected despite the seemingly massive dimensions of the whole affair , the world cup is not expected to bring in hefty profits for the security industry . " we 're making a huge effort here , " klauer said .
" we have permanent employees here who from morning to evening do nothing else but prepare for the world cup .

" tanks in the vicinity of stadiums : that would certainly be unacceptable , " theo zwanziger , the president of the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , recently said in an interview .
" we want people to hug each other .
if tanks are stationed in the background - even as a preventive measure - it just would n't work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police are n't going to manage on their own even as uncertainty surrounds the deployment of the german army during the world cup , one thing 's clear : germany 's police forces will be overstretched because organizers are expecting more than seven million visitors to descend on the country for the mega event . this is where private security firms are expected to step in .
harald olschok , head of the federal association of german security firms -lrb- bdws -rrb- , said the industry is gearing up for the event . " it 's a huge stroke of luck for the industry , " olschok said , adding that it also posed an unprecedented challenge .
" for a relatively short period of six weeks there 's going to be a huge demand : around 12,000 security personnel will have to be deployed .
we 're not going to manage that with our regular forces . " boosting existing security ranks private security firms will play a big role particularly when it comes to providing security for the 32 team quarters and in the downtown areas in 12 german cities where the games will take place .
in addition , they 'll also take over security for live game broadcasts on huge public screens across germany . " the games will be broadcast on huge screens in at least 200 cities , " olschok said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : providing security for live coverage of games on massive screens is a challenge the so-called " public viewing zones " are considered particularly sensitive areas from a security point of view .
on the strasse des 17 .
juni - one of berlin 's main boulevards - alone authorities expect more than 100,000 fans to turn up for the screenings . security firms that regularly work for the german league or bundesliga soccer games will largely secure the downtown areas of the cities where the world cup games will take place .
one of them , the hamburg-based company power , is expecting it to be quite a challenge . " around 350 to 400 security personnel are usually required for a bundesliga game and 450 for a normal international game , " said carsten klauer , the company 's ceo .
" but that number will probably be doubled during a single world cup game . " boosting its security staff is also one of the prime concerns of the company leipziger löwen that will provide security in the saxon city of leipzig .
it plans to increase its current force of 160 to 1,500 temporarily . " we 've worked towards that purpose together with a local labor agency that 's set up an extra world cup office , " said ramon rodriguez , in charge of world cup matters at the company , adding that he 's still looking for more people . in theory anyone between the ages of 18 and 40 can apply , provided they do n't have any prior convictions .
however they do have to undergo a security check by federal police . robots to counter logistical nightmare most security experts do n't foresee any major hiccups during the event . " in light of the stringent measures such as only letting in persons in the stadiums whose names are already known , we assume that we 'll have almost perfect security in the stadiums , " olschok said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police in riot gear in a stadium hooligans will find it tough getting access and if riots did take place , the police would be standing prepared in the background .
the private security personnel will however not be armed . " we have the authority to expel someone , if necessary with force , from the stadium , " klauer said . despite all the elaborate preventive measures , there 's no ruling out the unexpected . " when it comes to bundesliga games , we know the routine very well , " he added .
" but it 's going to be very different at the world cup .
lots of vips , for instance , will be flown directly to the games by helicopter . " in addition , the world cup organizing committee has made it mandatory that all stadiums be secured around the clock during the world cup - a requirement that involves a huge technical and logistical challenge . klauer 's company thus plans to install a robot , both inside and outside the stadium in hamburg . " he 's outfitted with special cameras that react to motion and he can feed live pictures to the central monitor , " klauer said . special training to top it all another aspect of the mammoth process involves special training for all security personnel - as required by the world cup organization committee . germany 's railway operator , deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- , is responsible for the training .

not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .
the ultra-modern lines mixed with traditional proportions are typical for berlin 's post-wall architecture , in which past meets future , the station 's architects said . " the design is a cross , an intersection of east and west , past and future , " said jürgen hillmar , a partner at the firm gmp -lrb- von gerkan , marg und partner -rrb- , who is responsible for the project .
" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction . " like berlin itself . the new station , taking up 180,000 square meters -lrb- 1.9 million square feet -rrb- , will be europe 's largest hub , serving 300,000 passengers with almost 1,300 long-distance , regional and local trains passing through daily , officials say .
it will centralize train travel in the city for the first time - west-bound passengers currently use zoo station ; east-bound , lichtenberg or ostbahnhof . bildunterschrift : a model of the new station , which will have trains arriving and departing from several levels the station will also feature a three-level , 15,000 square meter shopping center that will stay open late nights and on weekends , including sunday . and officials hope it will draw the crowds and revitalize the area . " for years , that area was a desert , " baufeld said .
" but we have had 10,000 visitors annually to the site since we started building .
it is a good start to begin to develop this whole area . " rising from the ashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old station opened just in time for the first unification of germany lehrter bahnof originally opened in 1871 and was named after the first stop on the line leading to hanover , lehrte .
it was called a " palace " because of its classical and renaissance architecture and remained the key departure station in berlin for decades .
it was also a main economic engine for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . the station was severely damaged by bombing during world war ii .
while it continued to serve passengers , its importance in the divided city declined .
in 1952 , the gdr , responsible for berlin railways , decided to stop service to the station and demolition begun a few years later .
only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city .

but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden . " hofmann added his intention was to show a british pilot confronting the devastation wrought by his bombs , and disputes claims that the romance trivializes it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional movie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

but according to critics , the german makers of the wartime epic " dresden : an inferno " could not have made a bigger mess of the story if they had tried . for filmmakers , the dresden raid is one of the war ’ s last real taboos when it comes to the portrayal of the actual events before during and after the allied bombing mission on february 13 , 1945 which left approximately 50,000 people dead in the eastern german city ; a raid which is still regarded as a war crime by many germans . but popular opinion has it that the costliest production ever made by german tv , with a budget of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.01m -rrb- has forsaken the true horror of the events in favor of an improbable love story between a downed british pilot and a german nurse . millions of viewers tuned in on sunday night to see the wounded hero , played by british actor john light , survive a plane crash before walking into the heavily militarized city of dresden and then seduce a benevolent nurse with a few moody looks before exposing a corruption scandal . harrowing history over-sweetened by love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden is again reduced to rubble in the zdf drama in the second half of the zdf two-part mini series due to be shown monday , the city of dresden does get bombed but rather than dealing with the trauma on the ground and the crisis of conscience in the air , the story follows the two miss-matched lovers in their struggle to help each other as the firestorm rages . critics have slammmed the film , saying that an opportunity to make an important statement about the historical events has been missed and that treating the bombing as fiction shatters one of germany 's last historical taboos - one which has so far only been dealt in very cautious black and white documentaries . " why does one wish that dresden was never filmed ? " asked kerstin decker , chief critic of berlin 's influential tagesspiegel .
" because it makes a mockery out of suffering . " evelyn finger from the german weekly die zeit criticized the drama 's " revanchist dynamic " and the relentless depiction of the germans as victims .
" it 's perfidious .
the revanchist message is packaged so beautifully you scarcely notice it .
there are beautiful costumes .
and aesthetically it 's great .
the problem is you end up sympathizing with the germans , regardless of what they 've done . " improbable romance riles critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dresden bombing remains a taboo for many germans the maudlin love story has drawn particular fire .
anna , the german nurse played by felicitas woll , quite inexplicably turns to the british hero in distress after being saved from a firing squad by her doctor fiancée .
there is then an unnecessary sex scene in a hospital ward filled with sleeping and horribly wounded patients .
" we haven ’ t seen that even in hospital soap operas , " tagesspiegel ’ s decker wrote . " i did n't realize there was so much beautiful lingerie in dresden in february 1945 .
they must have been able to do some wonderful things with parachutes , " one british diplomat who saw the film observed dryly in the london daily guardian .
" it 's a bit melodramatic .
downfall this is n't , " he added , referring to the oscar-nominated film dealing with hitler 's final days in his bunker . sir peter torry , britain 's ambassador to germany , told the hamburger abendblatt : " i know that british pilots are not bad looking , but i find the love story a bit artificial . " film makers on the defensive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a real-life downed british pilot was the inspiration for the love story the makers of the film have been on the defensive ever since select previews triggered derisive responses last week .
sascha schwingel , the film 's producer , defended the central love story , even citing historical evidence to back up the inclusion of such a narrative .
he said the thread was based on a true story of a british pilot shot down during the war who had fallen in love with a german nurse , later settling in cologne . " this is a fictionalized drama , " he added .
" it 's important to tackle these themes for a younger generation of germans , who do n't watch documentaries and who have no memories of the war . " " we thought the story could only be told from a german-english perspective , " said nico hofmann of teamworx , which produced the mini-series .
" otherwise it ends up in the wrong political corner .
neo-nazis have been stoking 60-year-old resentments about the bombing in order to win political support in dresden . " hofmann added his intention was to show a british pilot confronting the devastation wrought by his bombs , and disputes claims that the romance trivializes it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : movie about dresden bombing confronts taboos germany 's first fictional movie about the allied bombing of dresden was screened at the berlin film festival this week , in a fresh sign the country is finally confronting its own wartime suffering .

not far away , another testament to the inglorious history and architecture of communist times is slated for demolition , the faded hotel unter den linden . but a few kilometers away , construction workers are racing to finish the city 's glamorous new central train station , also known as lehrter bahnhof .
it 's the last of the big projects after german reunification in 1990 , which included the reconstruction of potsdamer platz and the reichstag . this 10-year , 700 million-euro -lrb- $ 842 million -rrb- construction project , which is due to open in may , just before the soccer world cup , will have a three-story shopping mall and serve as europe 's biggest rail hub , essentially putting berlin 's two older train stations out of business . bildunterschrift : even while still under construction , the massive building has already become one of the city 's new landmarks city officials hope that the new station will be the end of the post-reunification phase and start a new chapter for a city , which has seen lower growth in population than expected and suffered through tough economic times . " we had big dreams for the city after the berlin wall fell and many of those were pulled down by reality , " said michael baufeld , a spokesman for the station project .
" but we hope that with good infrastructure and attractions such as the new station , we will draw more investors and visitors . " uniting the city the station will feature twin 12-story glass towers for offices and 46-meter arches rising gracefully .
filigreed-glass roofs will cross a glass-latticed hall , more than 300 meters -lrb- 328 yards -rrb- long , spanning the east-west tracks and adding sparkle to an empty landscape .
the ultra-modern lines mixed with traditional proportions are typical for berlin 's post-wall architecture , in which past meets future , the station 's architects said . " the design is a cross , an intersection of east and west , past and future , " said jürgen hillmar , a partner at the firm gmp -lrb- von gerkan , marg und partner -rrb- , who is responsible for the project .
" in berlin , architects often design incorporating elements of the past such as proportions and structure , while the building material and design go in a new direction . " like berlin itself . the new station , taking up 180,000 square meters -lrb- 1.9 million square feet -rrb- , will be europe 's largest hub , serving 300,000 passengers with almost 1,300 long-distance , regional and local trains passing through daily , officials say .
it will centralize train travel in the city for the first time - west-bound passengers currently use zoo station ; east-bound , lichtenberg or ostbahnhof . bildunterschrift : a model of the new station , which will have trains arriving and departing from several levels the station will also feature a three-level , 15,000 square meter shopping center that will stay open late nights and on weekends , including sunday . and officials hope it will draw the crowds and revitalize the area . " for years , that area was a desert , " baufeld said .
" but we have had 10,000 visitors annually to the site since we started building .
it is a good start to begin to develop this whole area . " rising from the ashes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old station opened just in time for the first unification of germany lehrter bahnof originally opened in 1871 and was named after the first stop on the line leading to hanover , lehrte .
it was called a " palace " because of its classical and renaissance architecture and remained the key departure station in berlin for decades .
it was also a main economic engine for the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . the station was severely damaged by bombing during world war ii .
while it continued to serve passengers , its importance in the divided city declined .
in 1952 , the gdr , responsible for berlin railways , decided to stop service to the station and demolition begun a few years later .
only the local trains serving the city 's suburbs remained , the last western stop before the border with east germany - and the once-thriving area fell into decay and desolation in the no-man 's land . after the fall of the berlin wall and berlin 's reemergence as germany 's capital , officials decided that the city needed to better integrate and centralize their transportation networks - and the old lehrter bahnhof , which lies close to the government district , brandenburg gate and potsdamer platz , was deemed the perfect place . deflecting critics as german officials hope that the world cup games bring in tremendous economic benefits and shows a new german face to the world , so too do they hope that the new station provides an economic impetus and adds to berlin 's makeover . bildunterschrift : until now , trains have just passed through the new station the station will add capacity to departure options and facilitate travel , city officials say .
it will provide jobs and revive a key area .
it will add to the tourist attractions . but critics say the station was a waste of money and time as bankrupt berlin , with a double-digit unemployment rate , does n't need a flashy new station or more shops .
they also complain that construction time was triple that initially projected and that the project cost more than twice what was originally expected . many also worry about the impact on the beloved zoo station in the heart of the former west berlin . but supporters of the new station say it is time to move on . " berlin 's new train station , with its central location , its modern architecture and its extensive transportation opportunities will help distinguish berlin even more , " said ingeborg junge-reyer , a berlin official responsible for development .
" and it will serve as an invitation to our ever-changing and interesting city .

it is being destroyed to make way for the construction of a new presidential complex in the capital , dushanbe .
members of tajikistan 's ancient jewish community say they have not been given adequate compensation to enable them to build a new synagogue .
jews have lived in tajikistan for many centuries , but the community declined after the collapse of the soviet union .
bulldozers have already destroyed part of the compound .
the demolition of the synagogue building itself is expected to go ahead later in the year .
dushanbe 's small jewish community , mostly poor and elderly , have almost resigned themselves to losing their only place of worship .
but they say the distant plot of land the government has given them in exchange is inadequate compensation .
they can not afford to build a new synagogue , and they say the new land , on the edge of the city , is too far away .
afraid to speak out the current synagogue sits on a prime site in the middle of the capital , where the government is building a large new office complex for the president .
the rabbi says the community still hopes the government , or international jewish groups , will help them to acquire an appropriate building for a new synagogue .
but people familiar with the jewish community in dushanbe say those opposed to the demolition had been threatened by officials and most of the congregation are afraid to speak out .
tajikistan 's jews are members of the ancient community of persian-speaking bukharan jews , who have lived in central asia for more than 2,000 years .
dushanbe 's synagogue was built about 100 years ago , in what was then one of the city 's two jewish quarters .
two other synagogues in tajikistan were closed during the soviet period .
only about 300 jews now live in dushanbe , and less than 1,000 in the entire country .
tens of thousands have emigrated since the collapse of the soviet union and the five year civil war which broke out in tajikistan immediately afterwards .

he was right for many of the actresses attending the 78th oscar ceremony .
michelle williams went for the brave option of a yellow vera wang ziyi zhang dazzled in a black bustier with a full skirt covered in swarovski crystals by giorgio armani while jessica alba sparkled in a gold versace halterneck .
jada pinkett smith glowed in strapless sapphire blue roberto cavalli and queen latifah shone in a black carmen marc valvo dress with layers of shiny material cut on the bias that shimmered as she walked .
j-lo also went for glamour , eschewing the jenny from the block image to go for full on jennifer lopez style in a stunning floor-length vintage green gown .
it is often said that empire line dresses make even the slimmest of stars look pregnant .
rachel weisz , winner of best supporting actress , really is seven months pregnant , and looked beautiful in her black silk empire line dress by narciso rodriguez .
charlize theron 's dress was one of many striking outfits on show in pictures mismatched necklace yellow is a brave choice for anyone to wear ; there 's certainly no melting into the background if you realise halfway through that you 've made a fashion faux pas .
renee zellweger carried it off in 2001 with a lemon yellow gown from the vintage haute couture collection lily et cie gown , as did cate blanchett last year in her pale yellow valentino .
michelle williams , nominated for best supporting actress for brokeback mountain , chose to follow in their footsteps this year .
she was n't a winner with an oscar but her dress , a canary yellow number with a plunging tulle neckline and a classical style skirt by vera wang was .
also in vera wang was keira knightley , in a burgundy one shouldered gown which made her look far older than her 20 years and did n't really go with her very large sapphire , emerald and ruby necklace .
charlize theron 's dress came with an enormous shoulder bow earlier this year reese witherspoon 's golden globe dress caused fashion editors to snigger into their champagne cocktails when they realised they had seen the chanel frock a few years earlier , worn by kirsten dunst .
witherspoon was the only one wearing her vintage christian dior white gown with its horizontal rows of silver beads at the oscars .
eccentric british males it made her look a little bit like a curtain , but a very pretty curtain and , after winning her oscar for best actress , a very happy one .
of course the men do fashion too , albeit in a slightly more understated way .
host jon stewart opted to go for a plain black tie over the more traditional bow tie .
so did will smith with his midnight blue ensemble .
wearing bow ties however and representing a certain type of eccentric british male were nick park and steve box whose film wallace and gromit : the curse of the were-rabbit won best animated film and who collected their award wearing rather large , matching , stripy ones .
the night before the oscars were the golden raspberries awards , better known as the razzies , awards that " honour " the worst films and actors .
dolly parton wowed the red carpet in pink if there was a razzie for worst oscar dress there would have been two lead contenders : charlize theron who wore a christian dior dress which would have been nice had it not been for the absolutely huge and completely pointless bow on her shoulder , and naomi watts who eclipsed the misplaced bow with her one shoulder tulle givenchy dress .
underarm netting perhaps she was merely showing commitment to her role as ann darrow in king kong - it certainly looked like it might have been a nice dress once before being dragged by a giant ape through a jungle inhabited by dinosaurs .
but it was the older women , bar felicity huffman in an extremely low cut zac posen with underarm netting , who showed the youngsters a thing or two about what to wear on the red carpet .
joan rivers looked like she was having a great time in her grey floor length off the shoulder dress with a band of feathers around the bust ; italian cristina comencini , director of best foreign language film nominee do n't tell in a black dress with a funky jacket ; dame judi dench in an eastern inspired turquoise gown with embroidered floor length jacket .
and then there was dolly parton who managed it twice , appearing on the red carpet in a baby pink chiffon split number and changing into a white suit with sparkles for her rendition of travelin ' thru from the film transamerica .

he was right for many of the actresses attending the 78th oscar ceremony .
ziyi zhang dazzled in a black bustier with a full skirt covered in swarovski crystals by giorgio armani while jessica alba sparkled in a gold versace halterneck .
jada pinkett smith glowed in strapless sapphire blue roberto cavalli and queen latifah shone in a black carmen marc valvo dress with layers of shiny material cut on the bias that shimmered as she walked .
j-lo also went for glamour , eschewing the jenny from the block image to go for full on jennifer lopez style in a stunning floor-length vintage green gown .
it is often said that empire line dresses make even the slimmest of stars look pregnant .
rachel weisz , winner of best supporting actress , really is seven months pregnant , and looked beautiful in her black silk empire line dress by narciso rodriguez .
mismatched necklace yellow is a brave choice for anyone to wear ; there 's certainly no melting into the background if you realise halfway through that you 've made a fashion faux pas .
renee zellweger carried it off in 2001 with a lemon yellow gown from the vintage haute couture collection lily et cie gown , as did cate blanchett last year in her pale yellow valentino .
michelle williams , nominated for best supporting actress for brokeback mountain , chose to follow in their footsteps this year .
she was n't a winner with an oscar but her dress , a canary yellow number with a plunging tulle neckline and a classical style skirt by vera wang was .
also in vera wang was keira knightley , in a burgundy one shouldered gown which made her look far older than her 20 years and did n't really go with her very large sapphire , emerald and ruby necklace .
earlier this year reese witherspoon 's golden globe dress caused fashion editors to snigger into their champagne cocktails when they realised they had seen the chanel frock a few years earlier , worn by kirsten dunst .
witherspoon was the only one wearing her vintage christian dior white gown with its horizontal rows of silver beads at the oscars .
eccentric british males it made her look a little bit like a curtain , but a very pretty curtain and , after winning her oscar for best actress , a very happy one .
of course the men do fashion too , albeit in a slightly more understated way .
host jon stewart opted to go for a plain black tie over the more traditional bow tie .
so did will smith with his midnight blue ensemble .
wearing bow ties however and representing a certain type of eccentric british male were nick park and steve box whose film wallace and gromit : the curse of the were-rabbit won best animated film and who collected their award wearing rather large , matching , stripy ones .
the night before the oscars were the golden raspberries awards , better known as the razzies , awards that " honour " the worst films and actors .

tsotsi is a young gangster who has fended for himself in a shantytown just outside of johannesburg since he was a child .
he and his pack of feral friends have little regard for human life .
they rob and murder to survive .
one night tsotsi steals a wealthy black woman 's car .
when he drives away he realises that an infant is in the back seat .
tsotsi tries to care for the child by carrying him around in a shopping bag and coercing his neighbour , a young mother , to nurse him .
tsotsi is based on the novel by renowned south african writer athol fugard .
his book is set in the south africa of the 1950s , a nation then rife with apartheid .
i grew up in a township so i knew guys like tsotsi presley chweneyagae , actor but director gavin hood sets his film version in the present and focuses on the modern day struggles of poverty and aids .
hood says his film is more about class than race .
" the issues in the film are very much about the gap between the haves and have-nots , if you want to politicise it in some way .
" really we wanted to make a film about a young guy who 's angry and struggling with his own identity who becomes a young man .
" in a sense it 's a coming of age story , a universal story , but it just happens to be set in a quite an extreme place . "
hood admits he was inspired by films like city of god , a 2004 oscar-nominee which is set in the brazilian slums .
he decided to shoot tsotsi in the street dialect of tsotsi-taal with all local actors rather than in english with a big name star .
south africans hail local film 's oscar victory in pictures getting cast as tsotsi - which means " thief " in south africa - was young actor presley chweneyagae 's big break .
" i grew up in a township so i knew guys like tsotsi ... we had lots and lots of screenings in the townships , for street kids , and i remember one day one of the guys said " oh that 's me " , and that was a relief .
" for south african actors to look and me and go ' oh wow , this is his first film and he can go to the oscars ' , it gets them going !
" i 'm still not over it ...
i 'm going to the oscars !
it 's every actor 's dream , " cheweneyagae says .
although this is not south africa 's first time at the oscars , director hood says being nominated for an academy award is a thrill because south africa 's film-making community is hardly vast .
" we have a small industry at home in terms of the local product that we make - there 's quite a big industry because a lot of the international production shoots there but in terms of our own local storytelling we 're just beginning to make more than one film every couple of years . "
director gavin hood describes tsotsi as a ' coming of age ' story hood believes south africa submitted tsotsi to the oscars because the film has a message of forgiveness , without being sugary sweet .
although south africa continues to struggle with disease and inequality , hood says south africans are proud to have transitioned from apartheid to democracy without bloodshed , which he feels is reflected in his film .
" i believe we have one central issue that we are proud of - and that is that we almost had a bloody revolution , " he said .
" mandela and de klerk and tutu with the truth and reconciliation commission brought us back .
" men like that really taught us about redemption and personal responsibility and forgiveness .
and i think that these themes of redemption , forgiveness , and personal responsibility are themes that south africans proudly understand .
" that 's at the core of tsotsi and that was why it was put forward as south africa 's entry and we 're really proud of that . "

tsotsi is a young gangster who has fended for himself in a shantytown just outside of johannesburg since he was a child .
he and his pack of feral friends have little regard for human life .
they rob and murder to survive .
one night tsotsi steals a wealthy black woman 's car .
when he drives away he realises that an infant is in the back seat .
tsotsi tries to care for the child by carrying him around in a shopping bag and coercing his neighbour , a young mother , to nurse him .
tsotsi is based on the novel by renowned south african writer athol fugard .
his book is set in the south africa of the 1950s , a nation then rife with apartheid .
i grew up in a township so i knew guys like tsotsi presley chweneyagae , actor but director gavin hood sets his film version in the present and focuses on the modern day struggles of poverty and aids .
hood says his film is more about class than race .
" the issues in the film are very much about the gap between the haves and have-nots , if you want to politicise it in some way .
" really we wanted to make a film about a young guy who 's angry and struggling with his own identity who becomes a young man .
" in a sense it 's a coming of age story , a universal story , but it just happens to be set in a quite an extreme place . "
hood admits he was inspired by films like city of god , a 2004 oscar-nominee which is set in the brazilian slums .
he decided to shoot tsotsi in the street dialect of tsotsi-taal with all local actors rather than in english with a big name star .
south africans hail local film 's oscar victory in pictures getting cast as tsotsi - which means " thief " in south africa - was young actor presley chweneyagae 's big break .
" i grew up in a township so i knew guys like tsotsi ... we had lots and lots of screenings in the townships , for street kids , and i remember one day one of the guys said " oh that 's me " , and that was a relief .
" for south african actors to look and me and go ' oh wow , this is his first film and he can go to the oscars ' , it gets them going !

the £ 2.5m first phase of the scheme is due to start later this month and finish halfway through august .

but it said a road scheme on this scale was not possible without disruption .
" the council is doing everything we can to minimise that disruption - and we ask residents to do the same , " councillor phil filmer said .
he said the council recommended that people consider travelling outside peak periods , taking an alternative route or using park and ride .

most of the 3km ring road will be two-way by the end of the first phase of the road project .
the second phase , planned for next year , will see the sir john hawkins flyover demolished along with other road improvements .

the project to turn the road system from one-way to two-way is described by medway council as one of the most challenging in its history .
the £ 2.5m first phase of the scheme is due to start later this month and finish halfway through august .
it is part of a 20-year programme to improve town and river sites in strood , chatham , rochester and gillingham .
the regeneration is expected to include 8,000 new homes and 10,000 new jobs .
minimise disruption the council said that for 25 years chatham 's current road layout had restricted pedestrian movement , stifled trade and isolated the waterfront .
but it said a road scheme on this scale was not possible without disruption .
" the council is doing everything we can to minimise that disruption - and we ask residents to do the same , " councillor phil filmer said .
he said the council recommended that people consider travelling outside peak periods , taking an alternative route or using park and ride .
" bear with us for now - you 'll like the road ahead , " he said .
most of the 3km ring road will be two-way by the end of the first phase of the road project .
the second phase , planned for next year , will see the sir john hawkins flyover demolished along with other road improvements .

a majority of the 33,000 staff who took part also said they do not have enough time to complete their work and that half regularly work unpaid overtime .
but it was also found that 88 % felt satisfied with the support they received at work .
the staff survey was commissioned by the welsh assembly government , employers and unions .
unpaid overtime it was conducted between september and december 2005 .
the survey also found that 16 % of those who responded have experienced physical violence in the workplace .
almost half said that they regularly work unpaid overtime .
brian gibbons said the findings on stress were concern the most common reasons given for doing that were : staff did not want to let down the people they work with ; it was necessary to meet deadlines ; it was impossible to do the job otherwise ; or that they enjoyed the job .
almost 60 % said that they did not have enough time to carry out all their work .
just over 43 % of staff indicated that they often think about leaving their employer , but about 66 % said that if they left their current job , they would stay within the nhs .

he added : " by finding out what they actually think about the service , nhs trusts , nhs wales and the welsh assembly government can work together in partnership with the trade unions to improve the service for all .
" overall , it seems as if the majority of staff are happy working for the nhs .

" we are the ones who talked about aids when it was only being whispered ...
we talked about civil rights ...

it was much simpler than that .
expressed bluntly by the academy president , it amounted to this : please keep going to the pictures .
every award seemed to bring another random set of clips from classic films , used to illustrate the sentiment that a cinema is " the only place to watch a movie " .
just to make sure no-one missed the message , the stage was even set up like the entrance to a movie theatre , complete with ticket office .
clearly , hollywood was taking the chance of grabbing its worldwide tv audience to preach its anti-piracy message to as many people as possible .
a worthy cause , perhaps , but hardly the key element of a great show .
frosty silence the early part of the 2006 oscars was dominated by a huge amount of " it-seemed-like-a-good-idea-at-the-time " .
perhaps fearing the oscars would be dominated by heavy politics , a large number of light-hearted skits were forced in .
most of them fell flat .
whether it was ben stiller flouncing in an all-green suit or tom hanks being shot by the academy orchestra , few of the pre-prepared routines received more than a smattering of polite chuckles .
and , despite a few killer one-liners , stewart began little better .
a joke about dick cheney shooting bjork 's dress - a reference to her swan creation from a few years back - brought the house down .
but digs at the democratic party tend not to go down very well in mainly left-leaning hollywood , and stewart made two in quick succession , both greeted with frosty near-silence .
even more unforgivably for the audience , he repeated the mistake made by chris rock last year of attacking the academy 's own , in this case , the baldwin acting clan .
the sharp intake of breath was audible , and stewart was in danger of seriously flopping .
but he brought them back on side by , rather than separating the politics and humour , bringing them together .
turning to a giant oscar statue behind him , he asked : " do you imagine if we pulled this down , democracy would flourish in hollywood ? " - a reference , of course , to the toppling of the statue of saddam hussein in baghdad in 2003 .
barrage and when this was followed up by a satire of the swift boat veterans for truth campaign in the 2004 presidential election - the role of john kerry being taken by dame judi dench - the audience visibly warmed .
but still , this was hardly biting stuff , and everything - stewart , the presenters , the awards themselves - soon began to be submerged beneath the seemingly endless blizzard of " is n't-cinema-great ? " montages .
there seemed to be no let-up .
at one point , a medley of nominated film scores went on so long , the producers cut to an ad break .
when they came back , the violinist was still playing .
stewart himself eventually got fed up .
" i ca n't wait till later , when we see oscar 's salute to montages , " he said .
things got better after three 6 mafia won best song , giving both stewart and most of the other presenters something to riff on - primarily the title of their song , it 's hard out here for a pimp .
ultimately , though , that was about as controversial as it got .
certainly , this was nothing compared to the show in 2003 , when the immediacy of the iraq war - coupled with the oscar win of michael moore - leant a real edge to the proceedings .
even george clooney , nominated for two different " message " films , actually spent most of his acceptance speech for syriana making self-deprecating batman jokes .
in the end , the host hit and missed , the dresses were divine and we were told how great cinema was .
it was a perfectly average year .
perhaps this year , the academy had decided to simply let the films speak for themselves .
