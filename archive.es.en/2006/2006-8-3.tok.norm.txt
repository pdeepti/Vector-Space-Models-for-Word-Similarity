dw-world.de - your fashion-conscious news source - is heading the trend in bringing you the latest and juiciest bits from the fascinating world of name-dropping birds . as an animal , you ca n't go any higher in the fashion world than becoming a must-have accessory of the cutting-edge tokyo teenage fashion mafia .
parrots are yet to achieve the cult status of the taco bell dog , but - judging by the recent media coverage - they seem to have taken their first steps on the way to stardom . hats off to parrots .
for centuries , they 've been stuck with a single , utterly demeaning and confidence-crushing role of a pirate 's sidekick .
year after year , generation after generation , they 've been hanging out exclusively with men who call themselves captain randal chumbucket , no-eyes herb or jelly-legs wade ; the seafaring demimonde whose fashion accoutrement consists of a peg leg , an eye patch and a hook ; and pre-metrosexual creatures who never shave or bathe , let alone condition or exfoliate . but those days are over .

" i wanna hold you and hug you and call you george " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , no language lab will be complete without a course in parrot phonology only days after a parrot in the german city of koblenz earned his celebrity status by almost getting its owner arrested when one elderly lady mistook its voice for that of a neglected child - yelling " mother !
mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time . " the birds definitely use a particular call exclusively with a particular bird and never for any other birds , " says rolf wanker , head of the hamburg university zoological institute 's behavioral research lab . " what is not yet clear , however , is whether these calls can be equated with what we would call names such as hans or fritz or whether they could be more generic labels such as ' my baby ' or ' my mate , " ' wanker said . a rose by any other name … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star chef jamie " fresh herbs " oliver is also creative when it comes to children 's names first of all , if parrots were giving conventional names to their children , one would certainly hope that they would be a little more inventive than hans or fritz .
no respectable avian wants to call their children hans or fritz .
if they did , they would be the laughing stock of the entire tropical forest . judging by their fabulous , flashy attire , parrots would probably go for something more exotic and glamorous - like all celebrities do .

"
for all we know , they could be hurling profanities at each other , telling their kids to shut up for once or uttering cries of parental despair -lrb- " shive me timbers ! " -rrb-
centuries of piracy must have left some kind of cultural trace on the species . other studies have shown that birds develop regional " accents " and " dialects " as well .
in the united states , sparrows on the east coast can laugh for days when one of the local clowns starts imitating their distant cousins from the south . the discovery by german scientists remains , nonetheless , a fascinating one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.08.2006 german health care reform : mission impossible ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care system needs some major surgery - it 's not getting it chancellor angela merkel put health care reform at the top of her government 's agenda .
but the reform plan she 's released has been roundly condemned and even brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets . germany has one of the best health care systems in the world , but experts have said for years that it wo n't stay that way unless it is substantially reformed .
the system faces a massive budget shortfall , largely due to a financing structure that no longer works in today 's germany due to rising costs , low birth rates and stubbornly high unemployment . a reform plan hammered out by merkel 's coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and conservative christian democrats was released last month to the public and immediately was subjected to scathing criticism by everyone from health care providers , unions and analysts to business leaders and even parts of merkel 's own government . it brought health care employees onto the streets , protesting at what they fear will be huge job losses , and sparked a highly visible feud between the heads of public health insurance companies and german health minister ulla schmidt , who has threatened to use legal means to punish those companies if they use patients ' health care contributions to fund a campaign critical of the government 's plan . the whole thing has left most members of the public shaking their heads , unsure of what the changes mean or if the high-quality health care to which they 've become accustomed is terminally ill . the problem germany 's health care system consists of 252 public health insurance companies , which cover almost 90 percent of the population , about 73 million people .
the other 10 percent – mostly high earners and the self-employed - are covered by private insurance plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no magic pill to make it all better , unfortunately the system is funded by contributions from employers and employees , who pay just under 14 percent of their salaries into it .
still , next year , there will be an expected shortfall of 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " there have to be difference sources of revenue .
we 've basically said the financing basis has to be broadened , " said barbara marnach , deputy spokesman of the aok public health plan , one of germany 's largest , which began lobbying hard as politicians took up the health care reform issue seriously in the spring . july saw the end of months of haggling over how to fill up quickly draining health care coffers , and several competing plans were put forward .
there was talk of introducing a flat health insurance fee , doing away with private plans to bring the well-off – and their money - back into the public fold , raising taxes or increasing employee contribution rates . everyone agreed something had to be done ; no one could agree what that something was .
all the proposals were potential political minefields . the proposed solution instead of raising taxes , which proved politically impossible due to an already scheduled increase in value-added tax in 2007 , the reform plan will ask that employer / employee contributions be increased by 0.5 percent next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will have to start paying for more services that were once covered by basic plans a new " health fund " will be introduced in 2008 into which those contributions will be paid , sweetened with some tax revenues -lrb- 1.5 billion euros in 2008 -rrb- from the federal government , mainly to cover health insurance for children .
the fund will pay out a flat fee , set by the government , for every insured person to the public insurance companies .
previously , individual health plans have collected workers ' contributions on their own . merkel called it a " breakthrough " and health minister schmidt has said it will reduce bureaucracy , boost competition and cut cost in a system which swallows around 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 179 billion -rrb- a year and employs 4.2 million people . the uproar but others are calling it by different names - " wasteful " , for example , saying the plan does little to cure the system 's ailments in the long term .
instead of cutting bureaucracy , it creates a whole new one , said aok 's marnach . " and that means now new organizations and procedures will have to be created , which brings with it more costs , " she said .
" the simple question is , what good is it going to do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's little love lost these days between health minister ulla schmidt and health insurance companies public insurers argue the reform plan runs counter to the goals set out by the government , since it will put more power in the government 's hands and give public insurance companies less ability to compete . " we have n't gotten more authority to act on the free market , rather this reform leads to further socialization .
it will simply be less efficient , " said marnach . some say the proposed reforms are a decent start , given the monumental nature of the task , although they are few .
sophia schlette , head of health care policy for the bertelsmann foundation , says the fears of creating a lumbering new bureaucracy are overblown . " the countries that do better when it comes to costs and various health care indicators are interestingly enough those country that have what here is being described as the horror scenario of the single health fund system , " she told german public radio . it also has some of those four million health insurance company employees worried about their jobs .
last week , 21,000 of them took to the streets in five cities demanding that the government rethink its reform plan , which according to marnach , could lead to a loss of some 25,000 jobs . if not this reform , which ? the reform plan 's vocal critics claim they are not just complaining about change and fully agree that reform is needed - just not this jumble of reforms that no one , not even members of the coalition government , seem particularly happy about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say political realities of germany 's left-right coalition goverment are standing in the way of real reform competing interests and political moves to keep the governing coalition from collapsing in a health care fight are both to blame for the watered-down compromise that was put forward , according to herbert weisbrod-frey , head of the health care policy department at the ver.di service union .

but the reform plan she 's released has been roundly condemned and even brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets . germany has one of the best health care systems in the world , but experts have said for years that it wo n't stay that way unless it is substantially reformed .
the system faces a massive budget shortfall , largely due to a financing structure that no longer works in today 's germany due to rising costs , low birth rates and stubbornly high unemployment . a reform plan hammered out by merkel 's coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and conservative christian democrats was released last month to the public and immediately was subjected to scathing criticism by everyone from health care providers , unions and analysts to business leaders and even parts of merkel 's own government . it brought health care employees onto the streets , protesting at what they fear will be huge job losses , and sparked a highly visible feud between the heads of public health insurance companies and german health minister ulla schmidt , who has threatened to use legal means to punish those companies if they use patients ' health care contributions to fund a campaign critical of the government 's plan . the whole thing has left most members of the public shaking their heads , unsure of what the changes mean or if the high-quality health care to which they 've become accustomed is terminally ill . the problem germany 's health care system consists of 252 public health insurance companies , which cover almost 90 percent of the population , about 73 million people .
the other 10 percent – mostly high earners and the self-employed - are covered by private insurance plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no magic pill to make it all better , unfortunately the system is funded by contributions from employers and employees , who pay just under 14 percent of their salaries into it .
still , next year , there will be an expected shortfall of 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " there have to be difference sources of revenue .
we 've basically said the financing basis has to be broadened , " said barbara marnach , deputy spokesman of the aok public health plan , one of germany 's largest , which began lobbying hard as politicians took up the health care reform issue seriously in the spring . july saw the end of months of haggling over how to fill up quickly draining health care coffers , and several competing plans were put forward .
there was talk of introducing a flat health insurance fee , doing away with private plans to bring the well-off – and their money - back into the public fold , raising taxes or increasing employee contribution rates . everyone agreed something had to be done ; no one could agree what that something was .
all the proposals were potential political minefields . the proposed solution instead of raising taxes , which proved politically impossible due to an already scheduled increase in value-added tax in 2007 , the reform plan will ask that employer / employee contributions be increased by 0.5 percent next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will have to start paying for more services that were once covered by basic plans a new " health fund " will be introduced in 2008 into which those contributions will be paid , sweetened with some tax revenues -lrb- 1.5 billion euros in 2008 -rrb- from the federal government , mainly to cover health insurance for children .
the fund will pay out a flat fee , set by the government , for every insured person to the public insurance companies .
previously , individual health plans have collected workers ' contributions on their own . merkel called it a " breakthrough " and health minister schmidt has said it will reduce bureaucracy , boost competition and cut cost in a system which swallows around 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 179 billion -rrb- a year and employs 4.2 million people . the uproar but others are calling it by different names - " wasteful " , for example , saying the plan does little to cure the system 's ailments in the long term .
instead of cutting bureaucracy , it creates a whole new one , said aok 's marnach . " and that means now new organizations and procedures will have to be created , which brings with it more costs , " she said .
" the simple question is , what good is it going to do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's little love lost these days between health minister ulla schmidt and health insurance companies public insurers argue the reform plan runs counter to the goals set out by the government , since it will put more power in the government 's hands and give public insurance companies less ability to compete . " we have n't gotten more authority to act on the free market , rather this reform leads to further socialization .
it will simply be less efficient , " said marnach . some say the proposed reforms are a decent start , given the monumental nature of the task , although they are few .
sophia schlette , head of health care policy for the bertelsmann foundation , says the fears of creating a lumbering new bureaucracy are overblown . " the countries that do better when it comes to costs and various health care indicators are interestingly enough those country that have what here is being described as the horror scenario of the single health fund system , " she told german public radio . it also has some of those four million health insurance company employees worried about their jobs .
last week , 21,000 of them took to the streets in five cities demanding that the government rethink its reform plan , which according to marnach , could lead to a loss of some 25,000 jobs . if not this reform , which ? the reform plan 's vocal critics claim they are not just complaining about change and fully agree that reform is needed - just not this jumble of reforms that no one , not even members of the coalition government , seem particularly happy about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say political realities of germany 's left-right coalition goverment are standing in the way of real reform competing interests and political moves to keep the governing coalition from collapsing in a health care fight are both to blame for the watered-down compromise that was put forward , according to herbert weisbrod-frey , head of the health care policy department at the ver.di service union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.08.2006 mahmoud ahmadinejad and the year of living dangerously großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has not shied away from pointing an accusing finger at his enemies iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was sworn into office on august 3 , 2005 .
one year on , deutsche welle 's peter philipp looks back on ahmadinejad 's impact on his country and on the wider international community . " even if our ministry of finance , our bank accounts and our households should be empty one day , as god is my witness , ahmadinejad and his government are ready to come here and work with their hands to build up lorestan .
we would be proud to do it . " it was another example of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's skill at gathering the population to him and whipping them into a frenzy of support with populist rhetoric .
speaking at a rally in the province of lorestan in march , ahmadinejad showed again how easy it was to get the iranian people on side - by showing that he was one of them . his simple lifestyle and his ability to distance himself from the corruption that has dogged many other politicians in his country adds credibility to his " man of the people " approach and sets him apart from his predecessors . these qualities and this approach were the primary forces behind ahmadinejad 's election victory on june 25 , 2005 .
in only the second round of the ballot , ahmadinejad secured 61 percent of the vote to end the challenges of the favorite ali akbar rafsanjani , leading to former parliamentary leader mehdi karroubi accusing the newly anointed president of electoral fraud . such claims and other voices of dissent have been silent for some time .
ahmadinejad became the islamic republic 's sixth president last year on aug .
3 ; since then , his words and actions have made his country and the wider world captive audiences . usa : ahmadinejad 's public enemy no.1 with populist outpourings , virulent anti-israeli and anti-american rhetoric and a self-confident and provocative posture in the crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad has created more foreign policy problems for his country in just one year than any of his predecessors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a point of antagonizing bush the target of most of his vitriol is the west and , specifically , the united states : " they accuse our people of violating human rights and freedom .
if god wants it , we will put -lrb- the americans -rrb- before people 's courts .
our people have culture and civilization ; ours are free and revolutionary people . " these people were promised a remedy for the unfulfilled hopes and the underprivileged existence of many of their number after ahmadinejad 's election victory .
the qualified engineer-turned-president , who was only two years before made mayor of tehran , made it easier for the man on the street to get cheap loans , buy homes and also health insurance . however , it soon became clear that on the domestic front , as well as in the international arena , ahmadinejad would be no trouble-free president .
he appointed old companions from his time with the revolutionary guards in ministerial and other posts - some of whom he then had to replace again after embarrassing displays of incompetence - and he began to distinguish himself in the wider world , making enemies and friends in equal measure . a damning appraisal of the un " justice should be of the utmost importance in this organization and according to its charter , all member states should have the same rights , " he told the united nations assembly during his first speech at the un .

3 ; since then , his words and actions have made his country and the wider world captive audiences . usa : ahmadinejad 's public enemy no.1 with populist outpourings , virulent anti-israeli and anti-american rhetoric and a self-confident and provocative posture in the crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad has created more foreign policy problems for his country in just one year than any of his predecessors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a point of antagonizing bush the target of most of his vitriol is the west and , specifically , the united states : " they accuse our people of violating human rights and freedom .
if god wants it , we will put -lrb- the americans -rrb- before people 's courts .
our people have culture and civilization ; ours are free and revolutionary people . " these people were promised a remedy for the unfulfilled hopes and the underprivileged existence of many of their number after ahmadinejad 's election victory .
the qualified engineer-turned-president , who was only two years before made mayor of tehran , made it easier for the man on the street to get cheap loans , buy homes and also health insurance . however , it soon became clear that on the domestic front , as well as in the international arena , ahmadinejad would be no trouble-free president .
he appointed old companions from his time with the revolutionary guards in ministerial and other posts - some of whom he then had to replace again after embarrassing displays of incompetence - and he began to distinguish himself in the wider world , making enemies and friends in equal measure . a damning appraisal of the un " justice should be of the utmost importance in this organization and according to its charter , all member states should have the same rights , " he told the united nations assembly during his first speech at the un .
" bigger power or bigger wealth should not provide any member with more rights than any other . " his speech set a precedent for bating the un .
as tensions increased over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad resolutely rejected every compromise offered as an unreasonable capitulation .
he then further angered the international community by ostentatiously celebrating iran 's first successful enrichment of uranium . at the same time , ahmadinejad opened a second front by launching scathing attacks on israel , quoting the revolutionary leader ayatollah khomeini by stating the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and adding his own words on holocaust denial . holocaust denial caused outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad favors explosive rhetoric " if the europeans say that they killed 6 million jews in the second world war ; if you have really burned 6 million jews in the ovens … and this seems to be correct because you maintain this over and over again and punish everybody which is of another opinion , you even condemn your scholars who are of another opinion … .so , we ask you : if you have really committed this big crime - why should the suppressed palestinian people be punished for it ? " " if you have committed a crime , you yourselves should pay for it .
our suggestion remains unchanged : if you have committed a crime , it is only right that you make part of your own land available - in europe , the usa , canada or alaska - and establish -lrb- a jewish state -rrb- there .
you could be assured that the iranian people have nothing against it . " ahmadinejad 's comments caused an international storm of outrage , which gave the iranian president the affirmation he needed to increase his attacks .
he compared the us administration , for example , to genghis khan and then likened israel to hitler 's third reich .
in the muslim world , ahmadinejad scored many points with his provocation , even in arab countries which had a natural distrust of iran but saw he was a man of conviction who was ready to take on the us and israel . stance has further alienated iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attitudes to iran in the west have hardened catastrophically , that loathing and irritation of the west colored the nuclear question and the west 's posture towards iran began to harden . a year after mahmoud ahmadinejad took office ; he has inspired much debate and has acquired mass support in his own country but has consequently painted iran into a corner .
if one is searching for a reason why , the most logical explanation would be that ahmadinejad would like to restore the atmosphere of the early islamic republic .
only in self-imposed isolation can such a theocracy survive on a continuing basis . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian president faces holocaust denial charges in germany a joint team of israeli and german lawyers has filed a criminal indictment against the iranian president in germany , requesting he be tried for holocaust denial .

parrots are practically the new chihuahuas .
dw-world.de - your fashion-conscious news source - is heading the trend in bringing you the latest and juiciest bits from the fascinating world of name-dropping birds . as an animal , you ca n't go any higher in the fashion world than becoming a must-have accessory of the cutting-edge tokyo teenage fashion mafia .
parrots are yet to achieve the cult status of the taco bell dog , but - judging by the recent media coverage - they seem to have taken their first steps on the way to stardom . hats off to parrots .
for centuries , they 've been stuck with a single , utterly demeaning and confidence-crushing role of a pirate 's sidekick .
year after year , generation after generation , they 've been hanging out exclusively with men who call themselves captain randal chumbucket , no-eyes herb or jelly-legs wade ; the seafaring demimonde whose fashion accoutrement consists of a peg leg , an eye patch and a hook ; and pre-metrosexual creatures who never shave or bathe , let alone condition or exfoliate . but those days are over .
all of a sudden , parrots are all the rage . " i wanna hold you and hug you and call you george " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , no language lab will be complete without a course in parrot phonology only days after a parrot in the german city of koblenz earned his celebrity status by almost getting its owner arrested when one elderly lady mistook its voice for that of a neglected child - yelling " mother !
mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time . " the birds definitely use a particular call exclusively with a particular bird and never for any other birds , " says rolf wanker , head of the hamburg university zoological institute 's behavioral research lab . " what is not yet clear , however , is whether these calls can be equated with what we would call names such as hans or fritz or whether they could be more generic labels such as ' my baby ' or ' my mate , " ' wanker said . a rose by any other name … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star chef jamie " fresh herbs " oliver is also creative when it comes to children 's names first of all , if parrots were giving conventional names to their children , one would certainly hope that they would be a little more inventive than hans or fritz .
no respectable avian wants to call their children hans or fritz .
if they did , they would be the laughing stock of the entire tropical forest . judging by their fabulous , flashy attire , parrots would probably go for something more exotic and glamorous - like all celebrities do .
just ask dweezle -lrb- zappa -rrb- , fifi-trixibelle -lrb- geldof -rrb- , jermajesty -lrb- jackson -rrb- or daisy boo -lrb- oliver -rrb- . and if they had to chose a german name , they would - in order to raise the community intellectual bar a notch higher - probably do it in the fashion of tommy lee jones by calling the parrot chick something along the lines of kafka lee jones . what are they talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parrots are slowly breaking out of the shackles of history secondly , if parrots are using generic labels , we ca n't be too sure that they are actually using affectionate platitudes such as " honey " or " sweetie . "
for all we know , they could be hurling profanities at each other , telling their kids to shut up for once or uttering cries of parental despair -lrb- " shive me timbers ! " -rrb-

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the wagner festival in bayreuth drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth " germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy " bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.08.2006 schlingensief 's " parsifal " deepens divide at wagner festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religious symbols abound in schlingensief 's " parsifal " christoph schlingensief 's controversial rendition of " parsifal " concluded the first round of the program at the wagner festival wednesday in what may be the most daring production to come from bayreuth . after monday 's conclusion to the first complete performance of the ring cycle on bayreuth 's " green hill " brought mixed reviews , christoph schlingensief 's controversial production of parsifal deepened the divide wednesday . the 45-year-old german director was met with boos , but also applause when he appeared on stage after the performance .
his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .
he presented kundry -lrb- evelyn herlitzius -rrb- , a helper to the knight searching for the holy grail , as a fundamentalist islamic fighter clad in black . " it may be a lot to expect of the people in the expensive seats , " the avant-garde producer said about his first opera in an interview with german news agency dpa thursday , " but i have reconciled nietzsche with wagner by negating wagner 's silly buddhist dream . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alfons eberz is parsifal , left , and robert holl is gurnemanz a biography of the producer that appears on his personal web site describes him as " a moralist with messages of an almost biblical tone " who " creates a permanent state of insecurity by blurring borders between reality and fiction , art and offense , intention and action . " in the interview , schlingensief added that , despite any controversy and " insecurity " that may have arisen , the festival heads had given his production " a high artistic rating , " which " would n't have been possible after the premiere in 2004 . "
then again , he has thoroughly reworked the opera since then . parsifal was the self-proclaimed wagner fan 's first opera production .
he said he now finds opera more exciting than theater and does n't exclude the possibility of returning to bayreuth for another project in the future . once again , applause for musical excellence hungarian-born conductor adam fischer , who conducted the ring in bayreuth from 2001 to 2004 , was praised by critics for a " precise , " even " consecrated " performance , though he may have " lacked tension " at times . as in the ring , both the conductor and the singers came away with high marks .
only the two producers - schlingensief and tankred dorst - have ruffled feathers and polarized critics . wagner 's parsifal is loosely based on wolfram von eschenbach 's middle high german epic parzival .
the work by the 12th century poet , probably inspired by chrétien de troyes ' perceval in french , is the first known german composition to thematicize the holy grail . it is speculated that wagner created a word play by changing the spelling of the epic : " parsi " is similar to the persian word for " persian " and " fal " is close to the german and english word " fall , " thus alluding to a " fall of the persians . " competition strategies for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief made a few revisions since the 2004 version shown here this parsifal rendition is certainly the most unusual production ever to be performed in bayreuth , wrote news agency dpa thursday .
other opera companies also perform wagner and , in spite of the advantage of having a long tradition , the bayreuth festival has to remain competitive . shortened runtimes for new productions should also add to the festival 's competitive edge by allowing for a greater sense of novelty in the program .
parsifal will be remade in 2008 , but it is unclear who will be entrusted with the production . the next fresh addition to look forward to is katharina wagner 's production of the mastersingers of nuremberg , planned to premiere in 2007 .
she is the daughter of the current festival director , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , and richard wagner 's great-granddaughter .
katharina 's bayreuth debut will be closely observed , as she is likely to succeed her father in running the festival . wednesday 's performance of parsifal concluded the first round of operas at this year 's wagner festival .
the ring , the flying dutchman , tristan and isolde and parsifal will be repeated in a total of 22 more performances until the festival ends on august 28 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth the first " ring " cycle concluded monday to mixed reviews and a polarized audience .
most agree , however , that conductor christian thielemann and the singers saved the underdeveloped production .
-lrb- aug .
2 , 2006 -rrb- debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth nike wagner , the niece of bayreuth festival director wolfgang wagner , advocated cuts to the opera festival 's state subsidies .
her appeal aggravated family tensions , but raised valid questions on german art subsidies .
-lrb- july 27 , 2006 -rrb- " germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy " culture researcher andreas wiesand talked with dw-world.de about the wagner family " soap opera " and said that germany 's arts subsidies are deeply rooted in history so the general public does n't question them .

his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .
he presented kundry -lrb- evelyn herlitzius -rrb- , a helper to the knight searching for the holy grail , as a fundamentalist islamic fighter clad in black . " it may be a lot to expect of the people in the expensive seats , " the avant-garde producer said about his first opera in an interview with german news agency dpa thursday , " but i have reconciled nietzsche with wagner by negating wagner 's silly buddhist dream . "

" in the interview , schlingensief added that , despite any controversy and " insecurity " that may have arisen , the festival heads had given his production " a high artistic rating , " which " would n't have been possible after the premiere in 2004 . "
then again , he has thoroughly reworked the opera since then . parsifal was the self-proclaimed wagner fan 's first opera production .
he said he now finds opera more exciting than theater and does n't exclude the possibility of returning to bayreuth for another project in the future . once again , applause for musical excellence hungarian-born conductor adam fischer , who conducted the ring in bayreuth from 2001 to 2004 , was praised by critics for a " precise , " even " consecrated " performance , though he may have " lacked tension " at times . as in the ring , both the conductor and the singers came away with high marks .
only the two producers - schlingensief and tankred dorst - have ruffled feathers and polarized critics . wagner 's parsifal is loosely based on wolfram von eschenbach 's middle high german epic parzival .
the work by the 12th century poet , probably inspired by chrétien de troyes ' perceval in french , is the first known german composition to thematicize the holy grail . it is speculated that wagner created a word play by changing the spelling of the epic : " parsi " is similar to the persian word for " persian " and " fal " is close to the german and english word " fall , " thus alluding to a " fall of the persians . " competition strategies for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief made a few revisions since the 2004 version shown here this parsifal rendition is certainly the most unusual production ever to be performed in bayreuth , wrote news agency dpa thursday .
other opera companies also perform wagner and , in spite of the advantage of having a long tradition , the bayreuth festival has to remain competitive . shortened runtimes for new productions should also add to the festival 's competitive edge by allowing for a greater sense of novelty in the program .
parsifal will be remade in 2008 , but it is unclear who will be entrusted with the production . the next fresh addition to look forward to is katharina wagner 's production of the mastersingers of nuremberg , planned to premiere in 2007 .
she is the daughter of the current festival director , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , and richard wagner 's great-granddaughter .
katharina 's bayreuth debut will be closely observed , as she is likely to succeed her father in running the festival . wednesday 's performance of parsifal concluded the first round of operas at this year 's wagner festival .

the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .
but this year , the 18-strong board was convening in person at the ecb 's eurotower headquarters in frankfurt , a sure sign that a move in interest rates was on the cards . the meeting was also attended by eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . worries about inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president jean-claude trichet said the rate could go up even further in the future inflationary risks are rising in the 12-country euro zone , primarily as a result of high oil prices , european central bank president jean-claude trichet said on thursday . " the risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented , " the ecb chief told a news conference after the increase was announced . the main risks included " further increases in oil prices , a stronger-than-anticipated pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices , and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , " the frenchman said . he added that euro-zone interest rates are likely to be rise still further . with area-wide growth currently above trend , inflation above target and credit and money supply growth accelerating strongly , the ecb believes higher borrowing costs are necessary to nip inflation the bud . area-wide inflation stood at 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in june , far above the ecb 's ceiling of 2.0 percent , fuelled by runaway energy prices . the bank is concerned that energy price developments may trigger so-called " second-round " effects , with demands for higher wages to compensate for the high price of petrol and heating oil leading to an inflation spiral . as yet , there is no sign of that happening , but the ecb believes that prevention is better than cure . about time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sky-high energy prices have economists worried commerzbank chief economist jörg krämer said the tightening move on thursday was " long overdue " . " the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum .

" the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum . " in recent months , economic activity in the euro area , and in germany in particular , has increasingly gained strength , " glos said in a short statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers find world cup triggers stock market response like many a soccer ball in germany right now , the german stock market has been bouncing up and down and round this week .

mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time .

" we have a good chance to escape the political war and pass to political competition , " yushchenko added . other than accepting yanukovych 's candidacy , yushchenko 's only other viable option would have been to dissolve parliament and hope to win new elections while prolonging the crisis that has gripped ukraine since march . he said a pact agreed with yanukovych 's pro-russian regions party would be signed later thursday and would ensure that the country kept to its current pro-western course .

" concerning the principles determining ukraine 's domestic and foreign policy , its continuity , we have made a full stop today , " yushchenko said .
" i am sure that there will be no more discussions . " yanukovych 's regions party won the most seats at the elections , picking up support in the pro-russian east of the country and opposing yushchenko 's plans for ukraine to join the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- , but it failed to win an overall majority . there were no immediate comments from regions on how it planned to cooperate with yushchenko nor details on the likely distribution of cabinet seats . tymoshe n ko 's place still up i n the air thursday 's talks had extended beyond a constitutional deadline of 15 days for yushchenko to decide either to approve yanukovych 's candidacy or dissolve parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko said she fears the effects of a pro-russian government yanukovych , a 56-year-old former electrician from ukraine 's industrial east , served as prime minister between 2002 and 2004 but was forced to back down from a presidential bid when hundreds of thousands of people staged peaceful protests against the election result . in the recent negotiations yushchenko 's glamorous " orange revolution " ally , yulia tymoshenko , opposed a return to power by pro-russian forces , saying it would be better to dissolve parliament than " betray " those who came onto the streets . the idea of ukrainian membership of the european union and nato has prompted consternation in moscow , which has long considered ukraine part of its sphere of influence . despite warnings that the crisis could deter much-needed investment , the economy has picked up recently .

speaking at a rally in the province of lorestan in march , ahmadinejad showed again how easy it was to get the iranian people on side - by showing that he was one of them . his simple lifestyle and his ability to distance himself from the corruption that has dogged many other politicians in his country adds credibility to his " man of the people " approach and sets him apart from his predecessors . these qualities and this approach were the primary forces behind ahmadinejad 's election victory on june 25 , 2005 .
in only the second round of the ballot , ahmadinejad secured 61 percent of the vote to end the challenges of the favorite ali akbar rafsanjani , leading to former parliamentary leader mehdi karroubi accusing the newly anointed president of electoral fraud . such claims and other voices of dissent have been silent for some time .

" viktor yushchenko emerged from talks in the early hours of thursday morning to announce that the main obstacles had finally been overcome in negotiations that followed march 's parliamentary elections . " i have decided to put forward the candidacy of viktor yushchenko for the post of prime minister , " yushchenko told journalists . yushchenko said he realized submitting his former rival 's name for nomination could cause a misunderstanding among members of the mass " orange revolution " protests , which were responsible for ousting yanukovych two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko said he understood some would be upset with his decision " i ask people to understand that we have a unique chance about which we talked about on independence square , about which we dreamed every day - to unite both sides of the dniper -lrb- river -rrb- in understanding , " yushchenko said , referring to the kiev square that was the center of the orange revolution mass protests and to the river that bisects ukraine . " we have a good chance to escape the political war and pass to political competition , " yushchenko added . other than accepting yanukovych 's candidacy , yushchenko 's only other viable option would have been to dissolve parliament and hope to win new elections while prolonging the crisis that has gripped ukraine since march . he said a pact agreed with yanukovych 's pro-russian regions party would be signed later thursday and would ensure that the country kept to its current pro-western course .
a politician with close ties to the kremlin and big business , yanukovych shares few of revolution 's reforming ideals . a n e n d to draw n out n egotiatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych is seen as an economic pragmatist without going into the details , the ukrainian president said part of the deal with his rival included written promises that yanukovych would not try to turn around the country 's attempts at market reforms or european integration . " concerning the principles determining ukraine 's domestic and foreign policy , its continuity , we have made a full stop today , " yushchenko said .
" i am sure that there will be no more discussions . " yanukovych 's regions party won the most seats at the elections , picking up support in the pro-russian east of the country and opposing yushchenko 's plans for ukraine to join the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- , but it failed to win an overall majority . there were no immediate comments from regions on how it planned to cooperate with yushchenko nor details on the likely distribution of cabinet seats . tymoshe n ko 's place still up i n the air thursday 's talks had extended beyond a constitutional deadline of 15 days for yushchenko to decide either to approve yanukovych 's candidacy or dissolve parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko said she fears the effects of a pro-russian government yanukovych , a 56-year-old former electrician from ukraine 's industrial east , served as prime minister between 2002 and 2004 but was forced to back down from a presidential bid when hundreds of thousands of people staged peaceful protests against the election result . in the recent negotiations yushchenko 's glamorous " orange revolution " ally , yulia tymoshenko , opposed a return to power by pro-russian forces , saying it would be better to dissolve parliament than " betray " those who came onto the streets . the idea of ukrainian membership of the european union and nato has prompted consternation in moscow , which has long considered ukraine part of its sphere of influence . despite warnings that the crisis could deter much-needed investment , the economy has picked up recently .

but the reform plan she 's released has been roundly condemned and even brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets . germany has one of the best health care systems in the world , but experts have said for years that it wo n't stay that way unless it is substantially reformed .
the system faces a massive budget shortfall , largely due to a financing structure that no longer works in today 's germany due to rising costs , low birth rates and stubbornly high unemployment . a reform plan hammered out by merkel 's coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and conservative christian democrats was released last month to the public and immediately was subjected to scathing criticism by everyone from health care providers , unions and analysts to business leaders and even parts of merkel 's own government . it brought health care employees onto the streets , protesting at what they fear will be huge job losses , and sparked a highly visible feud between the heads of public health insurance companies and german health minister ulla schmidt , who has threatened to use legal means to punish those companies if they use patients ' health care contributions to fund a campaign critical of the government 's plan . the whole thing has left most members of the public shaking their heads , unsure of what the changes mean or if the high-quality health care to which they 've become accustomed is terminally ill . the problem germany 's health care system consists of 252 public health insurance companies , which cover almost 90 percent of the population , about 73 million people .
the other 10 percent – mostly high earners and the self-employed - are covered by private insurance plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no magic pill to make it all better , unfortunately the system is funded by contributions from employers and employees , who pay just under 14 percent of their salaries into it .
still , next year , there will be an expected shortfall of 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " there have to be difference sources of revenue .
we 've basically said the financing basis has to be broadened , " said barbara marnach , deputy spokesman of the aok public health plan , one of germany 's largest , which began lobbying hard as politicians took up the health care reform issue seriously in the spring . july saw the end of months of haggling over how to fill up quickly draining health care coffers , and several competing plans were put forward .
there was talk of introducing a flat health insurance fee , doing away with private plans to bring the well-off – and their money - back into the public fold , raising taxes or increasing employee contribution rates . everyone agreed something had to be done ; no one could agree what that something was .
all the proposals were potential political minefields . the proposed solution instead of raising taxes , which proved politically impossible due to an already scheduled increase in value-added tax in 2007 , the reform plan will ask that employer / employee contributions be increased by 0.5 percent next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will have to start paying for more services that were once covered by basic plans a new " health fund " will be introduced in 2008 into which those contributions will be paid , sweetened with some tax revenues -lrb- 1.5 billion euros in 2008 -rrb- from the federal government , mainly to cover health insurance for children .
the fund will pay out a flat fee , set by the government , for every insured person to the public insurance companies .
previously , individual health plans have collected workers ' contributions on their own . merkel called it a " breakthrough " and health minister schmidt has said it will reduce bureaucracy , boost competition and cut cost in a system which swallows around 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 179 billion -rrb- a year and employs 4.2 million people . the uproar but others are calling it by different names - " wasteful " , for example , saying the plan does little to cure the system 's ailments in the long term .
instead of cutting bureaucracy , it creates a whole new one , said aok 's marnach . " and that means now new organizations and procedures will have to be created , which brings with it more costs , " she said .
" the simple question is , what good is it going to do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's little love lost these days between health minister ulla schmidt and health insurance companies public insurers argue the reform plan runs counter to the goals set out by the government , since it will put more power in the government 's hands and give public insurance companies less ability to compete . " we have n't gotten more authority to act on the free market , rather this reform leads to further socialization .
it will simply be less efficient , " said marnach . some say the proposed reforms are a decent start , given the monumental nature of the task , although they are few .
sophia schlette , head of health care policy for the bertelsmann foundation , says the fears of creating a lumbering new bureaucracy are overblown . " the countries that do better when it comes to costs and various health care indicators are interestingly enough those country that have what here is being described as the horror scenario of the single health fund system , " she told german public radio . it also has some of those four million health insurance company employees worried about their jobs .
last week , 21,000 of them took to the streets in five cities demanding that the government rethink its reform plan , which according to marnach , could lead to a loss of some 25,000 jobs . if not this reform , which ? the reform plan 's vocal critics claim they are not just complaining about change and fully agree that reform is needed - just not this jumble of reforms that no one , not even members of the coalition government , seem particularly happy about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say political realities of germany 's left-right coalition goverment are standing in the way of real reform competing interests and political moves to keep the governing coalition from collapsing in a health care fight are both to blame for the watered-down compromise that was put forward , according to herbert weisbrod-frey , head of the health care policy department at the ver.di service union .

parrots are practically the new chihuahuas .
dw-world.de - your fashion-conscious news source - is heading the trend in bringing you the latest and juiciest bits from the fascinating world of name-dropping birds . as an animal , you ca n't go any higher in the fashion world than becoming a must-have accessory of the cutting-edge tokyo teenage fashion mafia .
parrots are yet to achieve the cult status of the taco bell dog , but - judging by the recent media coverage - they seem to have taken their first steps on the way to stardom . hats off to parrots .
for centuries , they 've been stuck with a single , utterly demeaning and confidence-crushing role of a pirate 's sidekick .
year after year , generation after generation , they 've been hanging out exclusively with men who call themselves captain randal chumbucket , no-eyes herb or jelly-legs wade ; the seafaring demimonde whose fashion accoutrement consists of a peg leg , an eye patch and a hook ; and pre-metrosexual creatures who never shave or bathe , let alone condition or exfoliate . but those days are over .
all of a sudden , parrots are all the rage . " i wanna hold you and hug you and call you george " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , no language lab will be complete without a course in parrot phonology only days after a parrot in the german city of koblenz earned his celebrity status by almost getting its owner arrested when one elderly lady mistook its voice for that of a neglected child - yelling " mother !
mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time . " the birds definitely use a particular call exclusively with a particular bird and never for any other birds , " says rolf wanker , head of the hamburg university zoological institute 's behavioral research lab . " what is not yet clear , however , is whether these calls can be equated with what we would call names such as hans or fritz or whether they could be more generic labels such as ' my baby ' or ' my mate , " ' wanker said . a rose by any other name … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star chef jamie " fresh herbs " oliver is also creative when it comes to children 's names first of all , if parrots were giving conventional names to their children , one would certainly hope that they would be a little more inventive than hans or fritz .
no respectable avian wants to call their children hans or fritz .
if they did , they would be the laughing stock of the entire tropical forest . judging by their fabulous , flashy attire , parrots would probably go for something more exotic and glamorous - like all celebrities do .
just ask dweezle -lrb- zappa -rrb- , fifi-trixibelle -lrb- geldof -rrb- , jermajesty -lrb- jackson -rrb- or daisy boo -lrb- oliver -rrb- . and if they had to chose a german name , they would - in order to raise the community intellectual bar a notch higher - probably do it in the fashion of tommy lee jones by calling the parrot chick something along the lines of kafka lee jones . what are they talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parrots are slowly breaking out of the shackles of history secondly , if parrots are using generic labels , we ca n't be too sure that they are actually using affectionate platitudes such as " honey " or " sweetie . "
for all we know , they could be hurling profanities at each other , telling their kids to shut up for once or uttering cries of parental despair -lrb- " shive me timbers ! " -rrb-
centuries of piracy must have left some kind of cultural trace on the species . other studies have shown that birds develop regional " accents " and " dialects " as well .
in the united states , sparrows on the east coast can laugh for days when one of the local clowns starts imitating their distant cousins from the south . the discovery by german scientists remains , nonetheless , a fascinating one .
too bad the elderly lady from koblenz , who called law enforcement because she did n't realize she was eavesdropping on the neighbor 's parrot , did n't know about it . yo-ho-ho .
and a bottle of rum . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mama , can you hear me ?
television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .
this is a story about a neighborhood-watching german lady who also may have watched too much court tv .
-lrb- july 31 , 2006 -rrb- the best of " from the fringe " from expensive , second-hand chewing gum to strange ferrari auctions , from friendly berliners to the other tennis player named b. becker , from exotic " summer hole " stars to wheelchair cons , we 've gathered a selection of our " from the fringe " stories so you 'll always be up to date on the quirkiest news items to come out of germany .
call it like it is despite germany 's restrictive laws on acceptable names for children , quirky ones squeak through .

but the reform plan she 's released has been roundly condemned and even brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets . germany has one of the best health care systems in the world , but experts have said for years that it wo n't stay that way unless it is substantially reformed .
the system faces a massive budget shortfall , largely due to a financing structure that no longer works in today 's germany due to rising costs , low birth rates and stubbornly high unemployment . a reform plan hammered out by merkel 's coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and conservative christian democrats was released last month to the public and immediately was subjected to scathing criticism by everyone from health care providers , unions and analysts to business leaders and even parts of merkel 's own government . it brought health care employees onto the streets , protesting at what they fear will be huge job losses , and sparked a highly visible feud between the heads of public health insurance companies and german health minister ulla schmidt , who has threatened to use legal means to punish those companies if they use patients ' health care contributions to fund a campaign critical of the government 's plan . the whole thing has left most members of the public shaking their heads , unsure of what the changes mean or if the high-quality health care to which they 've become accustomed is terminally ill . the problem germany 's health care system consists of 252 public health insurance companies , which cover almost 90 percent of the population , about 73 million people .
the other 10 percent – mostly high earners and the self-employed - are covered by private insurance plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no magic pill to make it all better , unfortunately the system is funded by contributions from employers and employees , who pay just under 14 percent of their salaries into it .
still , next year , there will be an expected shortfall of 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " there have to be difference sources of revenue .
we 've basically said the financing basis has to be broadened , " said barbara marnach , deputy spokesman of the aok public health plan , one of germany 's largest , which began lobbying hard as politicians took up the health care reform issue seriously in the spring . july saw the end of months of haggling over how to fill up quickly draining health care coffers , and several competing plans were put forward .
there was talk of introducing a flat health insurance fee , doing away with private plans to bring the well-off – and their money - back into the public fold , raising taxes or increasing employee contribution rates . everyone agreed something had to be done ; no one could agree what that something was .
all the proposals were potential political minefields . the proposed solution instead of raising taxes , which proved politically impossible due to an already scheduled increase in value-added tax in 2007 , the reform plan will ask that employer / employee contributions be increased by 0.5 percent next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will have to start paying for more services that were once covered by basic plans a new " health fund " will be introduced in 2008 into which those contributions will be paid , sweetened with some tax revenues -lrb- 1.5 billion euros in 2008 -rrb- from the federal government , mainly to cover health insurance for children .
the fund will pay out a flat fee , set by the government , for every insured person to the public insurance companies .
previously , individual health plans have collected workers ' contributions on their own . merkel called it a " breakthrough " and health minister schmidt has said it will reduce bureaucracy , boost competition and cut cost in a system which swallows around 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 179 billion -rrb- a year and employs 4.2 million people . the uproar but others are calling it by different names - " wasteful " , for example , saying the plan does little to cure the system 's ailments in the long term .
instead of cutting bureaucracy , it creates a whole new one , said aok 's marnach . " and that means now new organizations and procedures will have to be created , which brings with it more costs , " she said .
" the simple question is , what good is it going to do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's little love lost these days between health minister ulla schmidt and health insurance companies public insurers argue the reform plan runs counter to the goals set out by the government , since it will put more power in the government 's hands and give public insurance companies less ability to compete . " we have n't gotten more authority to act on the free market , rather this reform leads to further socialization .
it will simply be less efficient , " said marnach . some say the proposed reforms are a decent start , given the monumental nature of the task , although they are few .
sophia schlette , head of health care policy for the bertelsmann foundation , says the fears of creating a lumbering new bureaucracy are overblown . " the countries that do better when it comes to costs and various health care indicators are interestingly enough those country that have what here is being described as the horror scenario of the single health fund system , " she told german public radio . it also has some of those four million health insurance company employees worried about their jobs .
last week , 21,000 of them took to the streets in five cities demanding that the government rethink its reform plan , which according to marnach , could lead to a loss of some 25,000 jobs . if not this reform , which ? the reform plan 's vocal critics claim they are not just complaining about change and fully agree that reform is needed - just not this jumble of reforms that no one , not even members of the coalition government , seem particularly happy about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say political realities of germany 's left-right coalition goverment are standing in the way of real reform competing interests and political moves to keep the governing coalition from collapsing in a health care fight are both to blame for the watered-down compromise that was put forward , according to herbert weisbrod-frey , head of the health care policy department at the ver.di service union .

but the reform plan she 's released has been roundly condemned and even brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets . germany has one of the best health care systems in the world , but experts have said for years that it wo n't stay that way unless it is substantially reformed .
the system faces a massive budget shortfall , largely due to a financing structure that no longer works in today 's germany due to rising costs , low birth rates and stubbornly high unemployment . a reform plan hammered out by merkel 's coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and conservative christian democrats was released last month to the public and immediately was subjected to scathing criticism by everyone from health care providers , unions and analysts to business leaders and even parts of merkel 's own government . it brought health care employees onto the streets , protesting at what they fear will be huge job losses , and sparked a highly visible feud between the heads of public health insurance companies and german health minister ulla schmidt , who has threatened to use legal means to punish those companies if they use patients ' health care contributions to fund a campaign critical of the government 's plan . the whole thing has left most members of the public shaking their heads , unsure of what the changes mean or if the high-quality health care to which they 've become accustomed is terminally ill . the problem germany 's health care system consists of 252 public health insurance companies , which cover almost 90 percent of the population , about 73 million people .
the other 10 percent – mostly high earners and the self-employed - are covered by private insurance plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no magic pill to make it all better , unfortunately the system is funded by contributions from employers and employees , who pay just under 14 percent of their salaries into it .
still , next year , there will be an expected shortfall of 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " there have to be difference sources of revenue .
we 've basically said the financing basis has to be broadened , " said barbara marnach , deputy spokesman of the aok public health plan , one of germany 's largest , which began lobbying hard as politicians took up the health care reform issue seriously in the spring . july saw the end of months of haggling over how to fill up quickly draining health care coffers , and several competing plans were put forward .
there was talk of introducing a flat health insurance fee , doing away with private plans to bring the well-off – and their money - back into the public fold , raising taxes or increasing employee contribution rates . everyone agreed something had to be done ; no one could agree what that something was .
all the proposals were potential political minefields . the proposed solution instead of raising taxes , which proved politically impossible due to an already scheduled increase in value-added tax in 2007 , the reform plan will ask that employer / employee contributions be increased by 0.5 percent next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will have to start paying for more services that were once covered by basic plans a new " health fund " will be introduced in 2008 into which those contributions will be paid , sweetened with some tax revenues -lrb- 1.5 billion euros in 2008 -rrb- from the federal government , mainly to cover health insurance for children .
the fund will pay out a flat fee , set by the government , for every insured person to the public insurance companies .
previously , individual health plans have collected workers ' contributions on their own . merkel called it a " breakthrough " and health minister schmidt has said it will reduce bureaucracy , boost competition and cut cost in a system which swallows around 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 179 billion -rrb- a year and employs 4.2 million people . the uproar but others are calling it by different names - " wasteful " , for example , saying the plan does little to cure the system 's ailments in the long term .
instead of cutting bureaucracy , it creates a whole new one , said aok 's marnach . " and that means now new organizations and procedures will have to be created , which brings with it more costs , " she said .
" the simple question is , what good is it going to do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's little love lost these days between health minister ulla schmidt and health insurance companies public insurers argue the reform plan runs counter to the goals set out by the government , since it will put more power in the government 's hands and give public insurance companies less ability to compete .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.08.2006 fischer says compromise and respect can defuse iran crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer has used his invitation to speak in tehran to offer his views on the nuclear crisis in tehran , joschka fischer said that iran 's right to civilian nuclear technology was accepted in the west but steps would have to be taken to rebuild confidence and defuse tensions over its enrichment program . he may be visiting iran as a privately invited guest speaker at a round-table debate organized by a tehran think tank , but former german foreign minister joschka fischer is not keeping his views on current middle east affairs to himself while in attendance . while speaking during the " iran-europe ties " debate at tehran 's strategic research center of the expediency council on wednesday , fischer told those gathered that iran 's right to produce nuclear energy for civilian purposes was officially recognized by europe and the west . but in an interview with a german newspaper published on thursday , fischer also warned that the country would face serious consequences if it defied the ultimatum the united nations issued to the islamic republic on monday . " no country denies iran 's right , " he said during the discussions in tehran , adding that only confidence-building measures were required to make a difference in the disintegrating relationship between iran and the west . " if such confidence-building is realized , great advantages either in terms of peaceful use of nuclear energy or in other political and economic domains would be provided for iran , " fischer added . ira n should help build co n fide n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with iran 's former negotiator hossein mousavian " if iran cooperates in confidence-building matters - as the un security council and the international atomic energy agency have requested - europe and all permanent members of the un security council would be ready to support iran 's right to peaceful use of nuclear energy . " " if iran cooperates with the international community , it will be the big winner , " he said " europe has accepted iran 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and respects the right , but iran 's hasty construction of heavy water reactor in arak and enrichment of uranium up to the level of 3.5 percent have worried europe . " fischer told the assembled academics and diplomats at the meeting that the west feared that an iran armed with nuclear weapons might prompt other regional states to enter into a race to acquire nuclear arms .
he warned that , as a result , the region could turn into a warehouse of nuclear weapons , which would be extremely detrimental to peace , stability and security in the middle east region . weapo n s fear must be removed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has been stepping up missile tests this year " relieving such a concern would be in favor of iran-europe relations , " he said .
" europe is ready to use all its capacity to support iran 's peaceful nuclear technology and cooperate with the country . " fischer explained that iran was facing an important moment in its history .
it could choose to take on a large and outstanding role in the middle east and the world , and assume a leading role in protecting peace , stability and security in the region , or choose to be a detrimental force , complicating and exacerbating its problems .
the country 's choice , he said , could be influenced by how other nations treat iran . " this is the time for clever diplomacy , " he said .
" in essence this will depend on the united states ' conduct towards iran .
and here there is cause for skepticism . " iran would also have to meet the west halfway to ensure a peaceful resolution to the nuclear stand-off . curre n t ira n sta n ce " clearly n egative " in the interview in thursday 's süddeutsche zeitu n g , fischer said that tehran 's current stance had given him " little cause for optimism " and that " iran 's official announcements on the un resolution are clearly negative . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would not bow to " force and threats " the un security council gave iran until aug .
31 to halt its controversial nuclear enrichment activities , which the west sees as a bid to acquire nuclear weapons .
hard-line iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday vowed that iran would not bow to " force and threats , " while iran 's parliament speaker gholam-ali hadad-adel called the un resolution " worthless . " despite such statements , fischer urged western diplomats to pursue contacts on all levels in iran because " radical and reform-minded politicians are having a heated debate behind closed doors " on the matter . " if the talks start more speedily and even in several phases , the chance for reaching mutual understanding will not be missed , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer visits iran as calls for a diplomatic role gather pace former german foreign minister joschka fischer began a four-day visit to iran monday as the guest of a tehran think-tank with a growing chorus calling for him to return to the middle east in a more official capacity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.08.2006 fischer says compromise and respect can defuse iran crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer has used his invitation to speak in tehran to offer his views on the nuclear crisis in tehran , joschka fischer said that iran 's right to civilian nuclear technology was accepted in the west but steps would have to be taken to rebuild confidence and defuse tensions over its enrichment program . he may be visiting iran as a privately invited guest speaker at a round-table debate organized by a tehran think tank , but former german foreign minister joschka fischer is not keeping his views on current middle east affairs to himself while in attendance . while speaking during the " iran-europe ties " debate at tehran 's strategic research center of the expediency council on wednesday , fischer told those gathered that iran 's right to produce nuclear energy for civilian purposes was officially recognized by europe and the west . but in an interview with a german newspaper published on thursday , fischer also warned that the country would face serious consequences if it defied the ultimatum the united nations issued to the islamic republic on monday . " no country denies iran 's right , " he said during the discussions in tehran , adding that only confidence-building measures were required to make a difference in the disintegrating relationship between iran and the west . " if such confidence-building is realized , great advantages either in terms of peaceful use of nuclear energy or in other political and economic domains would be provided for iran , " fischer added . ira n should help build co n fide n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with iran 's former negotiator hossein mousavian " if iran cooperates in confidence-building matters - as the un security council and the international atomic energy agency have requested - europe and all permanent members of the un security council would be ready to support iran 's right to peaceful use of nuclear energy . " " if iran cooperates with the international community , it will be the big winner , " he said " europe has accepted iran 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and respects the right , but iran 's hasty construction of heavy water reactor in arak and enrichment of uranium up to the level of 3.5 percent have worried europe . " fischer told the assembled academics and diplomats at the meeting that the west feared that an iran armed with nuclear weapons might prompt other regional states to enter into a race to acquire nuclear arms .
he warned that , as a result , the region could turn into a warehouse of nuclear weapons , which would be extremely detrimental to peace , stability and security in the middle east region . weapo n s fear must be removed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has been stepping up missile tests this year " relieving such a concern would be in favor of iran-europe relations , " he said .
" europe is ready to use all its capacity to support iran 's peaceful nuclear technology and cooperate with the country . " fischer explained that iran was facing an important moment in its history .
it could choose to take on a large and outstanding role in the middle east and the world , and assume a leading role in protecting peace , stability and security in the region , or choose to be a detrimental force , complicating and exacerbating its problems .
the country 's choice , he said , could be influenced by how other nations treat iran . " this is the time for clever diplomacy , " he said .
" in essence this will depend on the united states ' conduct towards iran .
and here there is cause for skepticism . " iran would also have to meet the west halfway to ensure a peaceful resolution to the nuclear stand-off . curre n t ira n sta n ce " clearly n egative " in the interview in thursday 's süddeutsche zeitu n g , fischer said that tehran 's current stance had given him " little cause for optimism " and that " iran 's official announcements on the un resolution are clearly negative .

parrots are practically the new chihuahuas .
dw-world.de - your fashion-conscious news source - is heading the trend in bringing you the latest and juiciest bits from the fascinating world of name-dropping birds . as an animal , you ca n't go any higher in the fashion world than becoming a must-have accessory of the cutting-edge tokyo teenage fashion mafia .
parrots are yet to achieve the cult status of the taco bell dog , but - judging by the recent media coverage - they seem to have taken their first steps on the way to stardom . hats off to parrots .
for centuries , they 've been stuck with a single , utterly demeaning and confidence-crushing role of a pirate 's sidekick .
year after year , generation after generation , they 've been hanging out exclusively with men who call themselves captain randal chumbucket , no-eyes herb or jelly-legs wade ; the seafaring demimonde whose fashion accoutrement consists of a peg leg , an eye patch and a hook ; and pre-metrosexual creatures who never shave or bathe , let alone condition or exfoliate . but those days are over .
all of a sudden , parrots are all the rage . " i wanna hold you and hug you and call you george " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , no language lab will be complete without a course in parrot phonology only days after a parrot in the german city of koblenz earned his celebrity status by almost getting its owner arrested when one elderly lady mistook its voice for that of a neglected child - yelling " mother !
mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time . " the birds definitely use a particular call exclusively with a particular bird and never for any other birds , " says rolf wanker , head of the hamburg university zoological institute 's behavioral research lab . " what is not yet clear , however , is whether these calls can be equated with what we would call names such as hans or fritz or whether they could be more generic labels such as ' my baby ' or ' my mate , " ' wanker said . a rose by any other name … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star chef jamie " fresh herbs " oliver is also creative when it comes to children 's names first of all , if parrots were giving conventional names to their children , one would certainly hope that they would be a little more inventive than hans or fritz .
no respectable avian wants to call their children hans or fritz .
if they did , they would be the laughing stock of the entire tropical forest . judging by their fabulous , flashy attire , parrots would probably go for something more exotic and glamorous - like all celebrities do .
just ask dweezle -lrb- zappa -rrb- , fifi-trixibelle -lrb- geldof -rrb- , jermajesty -lrb- jackson -rrb- or daisy boo -lrb- oliver -rrb- . and if they had to chose a german name , they would - in order to raise the community intellectual bar a notch higher - probably do it in the fashion of tommy lee jones by calling the parrot chick something along the lines of kafka lee jones . what are they talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parrots are slowly breaking out of the shackles of history secondly , if parrots are using generic labels , we ca n't be too sure that they are actually using affectionate platitudes such as " honey " or " sweetie . "
for all we know , they could be hurling profanities at each other , telling their kids to shut up for once or uttering cries of parental despair -lrb- " shive me timbers ! " -rrb-
centuries of piracy must have left some kind of cultural trace on the species . other studies have shown that birds develop regional " accents " and " dialects " as well .
in the united states , sparrows on the east coast can laugh for days when one of the local clowns starts imitating their distant cousins from the south . the discovery by german scientists remains , nonetheless , a fascinating one .

" " if iran cooperates with the international community , it will be the big winner , " he said " europe has accepted iran 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and respects the right , but iran 's hasty construction of heavy water reactor in arak and enrichment of uranium up to the level of 3.5 percent have worried europe . " fischer told the assembled academics and diplomats at the meeting that the west feared that an iran armed with nuclear weapons might prompt other regional states to enter into a race to acquire nuclear arms .
he warned that , as a result , the region could turn into a warehouse of nuclear weapons , which would be extremely detrimental to peace , stability and security in the middle east region . weapo n s fear must be removed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has been stepping up missile tests this year " relieving such a concern would be in favor of iran-europe relations , " he said .
" europe is ready to use all its capacity to support iran 's peaceful nuclear technology and cooperate with the country . " fischer explained that iran was facing an important moment in its history .
it could choose to take on a large and outstanding role in the middle east and the world , and assume a leading role in protecting peace , stability and security in the region , or choose to be a detrimental force , complicating and exacerbating its problems .
the country 's choice , he said , could be influenced by how other nations treat iran . " this is the time for clever diplomacy , " he said .
" in essence this will depend on the united states ' conduct towards iran .
and here there is cause for skepticism . " iran would also have to meet the west halfway to ensure a peaceful resolution to the nuclear stand-off . curre n t ira n sta n ce " clearly n egative " in the interview in thursday 's süddeutsche zeitu n g , fischer said that tehran 's current stance had given him " little cause for optimism " and that " iran 's official announcements on the un resolution are clearly negative . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would not bow to " force and threats " the un security council gave iran until aug .
31 to halt its controversial nuclear enrichment activities , which the west sees as a bid to acquire nuclear weapons .
hard-line iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday vowed that iran would not bow to " force and threats , " while iran 's parliament speaker gholam-ali hadad-adel called the un resolution " worthless . " despite such statements , fischer urged western diplomats to pursue contacts on all levels in iran because " radical and reform-minded politicians are having a heated debate behind closed doors " on the matter . " if the talks start more speedily and even in several phases , the chance for reaching mutual understanding will not be missed , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer visits iran as calls for a diplomatic role gather pace former german foreign minister joschka fischer began a four-day visit to iran monday as the guest of a tehran think-tank with a growing chorus calling for him to return to the middle east in a more official capacity .

the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .

" the risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented , " the ecb chief told a news conference after the increase was announced . the main risks included " further increases in oil prices , a stronger-than-anticipated pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices , and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , " the frenchman said . he added that euro-zone interest rates are likely to be rise still further . with area-wide growth currently above trend , inflation above target and credit and money supply growth accelerating strongly , the ecb believes higher borrowing costs are necessary to nip inflation the bud . area-wide inflation stood at 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in june , far above the ecb 's ceiling of 2.0 percent , fuelled by runaway energy prices . the bank is concerned that energy price developments may trigger so-called " second-round " effects , with demands for higher wages to compensate for the high price of petrol and heating oil leading to an inflation spiral . as yet , there is no sign of that happening , but the ecb believes that prevention is better than cure . about time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sky-high energy prices have economists worried commerzbank chief economist jörg krämer said the tightening move on thursday was " long overdue " . " the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum .

the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .
but this year , the 18-strong board was convening in person at the ecb 's eurotower headquarters in frankfurt , a sure sign that a move in interest rates was on the cards . the meeting was also attended by eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . worries about inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president jean-claude trichet said the rate could go up even further in the future inflationary risks are rising in the 12-country euro zone , primarily as a result of high oil prices , european central bank president jean-claude trichet said on thursday . " the risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented , " the ecb chief told a news conference after the increase was announced . the main risks included " further increases in oil prices , a stronger-than-anticipated pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices , and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , " the frenchman said . he added that euro-zone interest rates are likely to be rise still further . with area-wide growth currently above trend , inflation above target and credit and money supply growth accelerating strongly , the ecb believes higher borrowing costs are necessary to nip inflation the bud . area-wide inflation stood at 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in june , far above the ecb 's ceiling of 2.0 percent , fuelled by runaway energy prices . the bank is concerned that energy price developments may trigger so-called " second-round " effects , with demands for higher wages to compensate for the high price of petrol and heating oil leading to an inflation spiral . as yet , there is no sign of that happening , but the ecb believes that prevention is better than cure . about time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sky-high energy prices have economists worried commerzbank chief economist jörg krämer said the tightening move on thursday was " long overdue " . " the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum . " in recent months , economic activity in the euro area , and in germany in particular , has increasingly gained strength , " glos said in a short statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers find world cup triggers stock market response like many a soccer ball in germany right now , the german stock market has been bouncing up and down and round this week .

his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .
he presented kundry -lrb- evelyn herlitzius -rrb- , a helper to the knight searching for the holy grail , as a fundamentalist islamic fighter clad in black . " it may be a lot to expect of the people in the expensive seats , " the avant-garde producer said about his first opera in an interview with german news agency dpa thursday , " but i have reconciled nietzsche with wagner by negating wagner 's silly buddhist dream . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alfons eberz is parsifal , left , and robert holl is gurnemanz a biography of the producer that appears on his personal web site describes him as " a moralist with messages of an almost biblical tone " who " creates a permanent state of insecurity by blurring borders between reality and fiction , art and offense , intention and action . " in the interview , schlingensief added that , despite any controversy and " insecurity " that may have arisen , the festival heads had given his production " a high artistic rating , " which " would n't have been possible after the premiere in 2004 . "
then again , he has thoroughly reworked the opera since then . parsifal was the self-proclaimed wagner fan 's first opera production .
he said he now finds opera more exciting than theater and does n't exclude the possibility of returning to bayreuth for another project in the future . once again , applause for musical excellence hungarian-born conductor adam fischer , who conducted the ring in bayreuth from 2001 to 2004 , was praised by critics for a " precise , " even " consecrated " performance , though he may have " lacked tension " at times . as in the ring , both the conductor and the singers came away with high marks .
only the two producers - schlingensief and tankred dorst - have ruffled feathers and polarized critics . wagner 's parsifal is loosely based on wolfram von eschenbach 's middle high german epic parzival .
the work by the 12th century poet , probably inspired by chrétien de troyes ' perceval in french , is the first known german composition to thematicize the holy grail . it is speculated that wagner created a word play by changing the spelling of the epic : " parsi " is similar to the persian word for " persian " and " fal " is close to the german and english word " fall , " thus alluding to a " fall of the persians . " competition strategies for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief made a few revisions since the 2004 version shown here this parsifal rendition is certainly the most unusual production ever to be performed in bayreuth , wrote news agency dpa thursday .
other opera companies also perform wagner and , in spite of the advantage of having a long tradition , the bayreuth festival has to remain competitive . shortened runtimes for new productions should also add to the festival 's competitive edge by allowing for a greater sense of novelty in the program .
parsifal will be remade in 2008 , but it is unclear who will be entrusted with the production . the next fresh addition to look forward to is katharina wagner 's production of the mastersingers of nuremberg , planned to premiere in 2007 .
she is the daughter of the current festival director , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , and richard wagner 's great-granddaughter .
katharina 's bayreuth debut will be closely observed , as she is likely to succeed her father in running the festival . wednesday 's performance of parsifal concluded the first round of operas at this year 's wagner festival .

his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.08.2006 mahmoud ahmadinejad and the year of living dangerously großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has not shied away from pointing an accusing finger at his enemies iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad was sworn into office on august 3 , 2005 .
one year on , deutsche welle 's peter philipp looks back on ahmadinejad 's impact on his country and on the wider international community . " even if our ministry of finance , our bank accounts and our households should be empty one day , as god is my witness , ahmadinejad and his government are ready to come here and work with their hands to build up lorestan .
we would be proud to do it . " it was another example of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's skill at gathering the population to him and whipping them into a frenzy of support with populist rhetoric .
speaking at a rally in the province of lorestan in march , ahmadinejad showed again how easy it was to get the iranian people on side - by showing that he was one of them . his simple lifestyle and his ability to distance himself from the corruption that has dogged many other politicians in his country adds credibility to his " man of the people " approach and sets him apart from his predecessors . these qualities and this approach were the primary forces behind ahmadinejad 's election victory on june 25 , 2005 .
in only the second round of the ballot , ahmadinejad secured 61 percent of the vote to end the challenges of the favorite ali akbar rafsanjani , leading to former parliamentary leader mehdi karroubi accusing the newly anointed president of electoral fraud . such claims and other voices of dissent have been silent for some time .
ahmadinejad became the islamic republic 's sixth president last year on aug .
3 ; since then , his words and actions have made his country and the wider world captive audiences . usa : ahmadinejad 's public enemy no.1 with populist outpourings , virulent anti-israeli and anti-american rhetoric and a self-confident and provocative posture in the crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad has created more foreign policy problems for his country in just one year than any of his predecessors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a point of antagonizing bush the target of most of his vitriol is the west and , specifically , the united states : " they accuse our people of violating human rights and freedom .
if god wants it , we will put -lrb- the americans -rrb- before people 's courts .
our people have culture and civilization ; ours are free and revolutionary people . " these people were promised a remedy for the unfulfilled hopes and the underprivileged existence of many of their number after ahmadinejad 's election victory .
the qualified engineer-turned-president , who was only two years before made mayor of tehran , made it easier for the man on the street to get cheap loans , buy homes and also health insurance . however , it soon became clear that on the domestic front , as well as in the international arena , ahmadinejad would be no trouble-free president .
he appointed old companions from his time with the revolutionary guards in ministerial and other posts - some of whom he then had to replace again after embarrassing displays of incompetence - and he began to distinguish himself in the wider world , making enemies and friends in equal measure . a damning appraisal of the un " justice should be of the utmost importance in this organization and according to its charter , all member states should have the same rights , " he told the united nations assembly during his first speech at the un .
" bigger power or bigger wealth should not provide any member with more rights than any other . " his speech set a precedent for bating the un .
as tensions increased over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad resolutely rejected every compromise offered as an unreasonable capitulation .
he then further angered the international community by ostentatiously celebrating iran 's first successful enrichment of uranium . at the same time , ahmadinejad opened a second front by launching scathing attacks on israel , quoting the revolutionary leader ayatollah khomeini by stating the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and adding his own words on holocaust denial . holocaust denial caused outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad favors explosive rhetoric " if the europeans say that they killed 6 million jews in the second world war ; if you have really burned 6 million jews in the ovens … and this seems to be correct because you maintain this over and over again and punish everybody which is of another opinion , you even condemn your scholars who are of another opinion … .so , we ask you : if you have really committed this big crime - why should the suppressed palestinian people be punished for it ? " " if you have committed a crime , you yourselves should pay for it .
our suggestion remains unchanged : if you have committed a crime , it is only right that you make part of your own land available - in europe , the usa , canada or alaska - and establish -lrb- a jewish state -rrb- there .
you could be assured that the iranian people have nothing against it . " ahmadinejad 's comments caused an international storm of outrage , which gave the iranian president the affirmation he needed to increase his attacks .
he compared the us administration , for example , to genghis khan and then likened israel to hitler 's third reich .
in the muslim world , ahmadinejad scored many points with his provocation , even in arab countries which had a natural distrust of iran but saw he was a man of conviction who was ready to take on the us and israel . stance has further alienated iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attitudes to iran in the west have hardened catastrophically , that loathing and irritation of the west colored the nuclear question and the west 's posture towards iran began to harden . a year after mahmoud ahmadinejad took office ; he has inspired much debate and has acquired mass support in his own country but has consequently painted iran into a corner .
if one is searching for a reason why , the most logical explanation would be that ahmadinejad would like to restore the atmosphere of the early islamic republic .
only in self-imposed isolation can such a theocracy survive on a continuing basis . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian president faces holocaust denial charges in germany a joint team of israeli and german lawyers has filed a criminal indictment against the iranian president in germany , requesting he be tried for holocaust denial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the wagner festival in bayreuth drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth " germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy " bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.08.2006 schlingensief 's " parsifal " deepens divide at wagner festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religious symbols abound in schlingensief 's " parsifal " christoph schlingensief 's controversial rendition of " parsifal " concluded the first round of the program at the wagner festival wednesday in what may be the most daring production to come from bayreuth . after monday 's conclusion to the first complete performance of the ring cycle on bayreuth 's " green hill " brought mixed reviews , christoph schlingensief 's controversial production of parsifal deepened the divide wednesday . the 45-year-old german director was met with boos , but also applause when he appeared on stage after the performance .
his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .
he presented kundry -lrb- evelyn herlitzius -rrb- , a helper to the knight searching for the holy grail , as a fundamentalist islamic fighter clad in black . " it may be a lot to expect of the people in the expensive seats , " the avant-garde producer said about his first opera in an interview with german news agency dpa thursday , " but i have reconciled nietzsche with wagner by negating wagner 's silly buddhist dream . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alfons eberz is parsifal , left , and robert holl is gurnemanz a biography of the producer that appears on his personal web site describes him as " a moralist with messages of an almost biblical tone " who " creates a permanent state of insecurity by blurring borders between reality and fiction , art and offense , intention and action . " in the interview , schlingensief added that , despite any controversy and " insecurity " that may have arisen , the festival heads had given his production " a high artistic rating , " which " would n't have been possible after the premiere in 2004 . "
then again , he has thoroughly reworked the opera since then . parsifal was the self-proclaimed wagner fan 's first opera production .
he said he now finds opera more exciting than theater and does n't exclude the possibility of returning to bayreuth for another project in the future . once again , applause for musical excellence hungarian-born conductor adam fischer , who conducted the ring in bayreuth from 2001 to 2004 , was praised by critics for a " precise , " even " consecrated " performance , though he may have " lacked tension " at times . as in the ring , both the conductor and the singers came away with high marks .
only the two producers - schlingensief and tankred dorst - have ruffled feathers and polarized critics . wagner 's parsifal is loosely based on wolfram von eschenbach 's middle high german epic parzival .
the work by the 12th century poet , probably inspired by chrétien de troyes ' perceval in french , is the first known german composition to thematicize the holy grail . it is speculated that wagner created a word play by changing the spelling of the epic : " parsi " is similar to the persian word for " persian " and " fal " is close to the german and english word " fall , " thus alluding to a " fall of the persians . " competition strategies for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief made a few revisions since the 2004 version shown here this parsifal rendition is certainly the most unusual production ever to be performed in bayreuth , wrote news agency dpa thursday .
other opera companies also perform wagner and , in spite of the advantage of having a long tradition , the bayreuth festival has to remain competitive . shortened runtimes for new productions should also add to the festival 's competitive edge by allowing for a greater sense of novelty in the program .
parsifal will be remade in 2008 , but it is unclear who will be entrusted with the production . the next fresh addition to look forward to is katharina wagner 's production of the mastersingers of nuremberg , planned to premiere in 2007 .
she is the daughter of the current festival director , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , and richard wagner 's great-granddaughter .
katharina 's bayreuth debut will be closely observed , as she is likely to succeed her father in running the festival . wednesday 's performance of parsifal concluded the first round of operas at this year 's wagner festival .
the ring , the flying dutchman , tristan and isolde and parsifal will be repeated in a total of 22 more performances until the festival ends on august 28 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth the first " ring " cycle concluded monday to mixed reviews and a polarized audience .

" viktor yushchenko emerged from talks in the early hours of thursday morning to announce that the main obstacles had finally been overcome in negotiations that followed march 's parliamentary elections . " i have decided to put forward the candidacy of viktor yushchenko for the post of prime minister , " yushchenko told journalists . yushchenko said he realized submitting his former rival 's name for nomination could cause a misunderstanding among members of the mass " orange revolution " protests , which were responsible for ousting yanukovych two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko said he understood some would be upset with his decision " i ask people to understand that we have a unique chance about which we talked about on independence square , about which we dreamed every day - to unite both sides of the dniper -lrb- river -rrb- in understanding , " yushchenko said , referring to the kiev square that was the center of the orange revolution mass protests and to the river that bisects ukraine . " we have a good chance to escape the political war and pass to political competition , " yushchenko added . other than accepting yanukovych 's candidacy , yushchenko 's only other viable option would have been to dissolve parliament and hope to win new elections while prolonging the crisis that has gripped ukraine since march . he said a pact agreed with yanukovych 's pro-russian regions party would be signed later thursday and would ensure that the country kept to its current pro-western course .
a politician with close ties to the kremlin and big business , yanukovych shares few of revolution 's reforming ideals . a n e n d to draw n out n egotiatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych is seen as an economic pragmatist without going into the details , the ukrainian president said part of the deal with his rival included written promises that yanukovych would not try to turn around the country 's attempts at market reforms or european integration . " concerning the principles determining ukraine 's domestic and foreign policy , its continuity , we have made a full stop today , " yushchenko said .
" i am sure that there will be no more discussions . " yanukovych 's regions party won the most seats at the elections , picking up support in the pro-russian east of the country and opposing yushchenko 's plans for ukraine to join the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- , but it failed to win an overall majority . there were no immediate comments from regions on how it planned to cooperate with yushchenko nor details on the likely distribution of cabinet seats . tymoshe n ko 's place still up i n the air thursday 's talks had extended beyond a constitutional deadline of 15 days for yushchenko to decide either to approve yanukovych 's candidacy or dissolve parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko said she fears the effects of a pro-russian government yanukovych , a 56-year-old former electrician from ukraine 's industrial east , served as prime minister between 2002 and 2004 but was forced to back down from a presidential bid when hundreds of thousands of people staged peaceful protests against the election result . in the recent negotiations yushchenko 's glamorous " orange revolution " ally , yulia tymoshenko , opposed a return to power by pro-russian forces , saying it would be better to dissolve parliament than " betray " those who came onto the streets . the idea of ukrainian membership of the european union and nato has prompted consternation in moscow , which has long considered ukraine part of its sphere of influence . despite warnings that the crisis could deter much-needed investment , the economy has picked up recently .

" even if our ministry of finance , our bank accounts and our households should be empty one day , as god is my witness , ahmadinejad and his government are ready to come here and work with their hands to build up lorestan .
we would be proud to do it . " it was another example of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's skill at gathering the population to him and whipping them into a frenzy of support with populist rhetoric .
speaking at a rally in the province of lorestan in march , ahmadinejad showed again how easy it was to get the iranian people on side - by showing that he was one of them . his simple lifestyle and his ability to distance himself from the corruption that has dogged many other politicians in his country adds credibility to his " man of the people " approach and sets him apart from his predecessors . these qualities and this approach were the primary forces behind ahmadinejad 's election victory on june 25 , 2005 .
in only the second round of the ballot , ahmadinejad secured 61 percent of the vote to end the challenges of the favorite ali akbar rafsanjani , leading to former parliamentary leader mehdi karroubi accusing the newly anointed president of electoral fraud . such claims and other voices of dissent have been silent for some time .

the qualified engineer-turned-president , who was only two years before made mayor of tehran , made it easier for the man on the street to get cheap loans , buy homes and also health insurance . however , it soon became clear that on the domestic front , as well as in the international arena , ahmadinejad would be no trouble-free president .
he appointed old companions from his time with the revolutionary guards in ministerial and other posts - some of whom he then had to replace again after embarrassing displays of incompetence - and he began to distinguish himself in the wider world , making enemies and friends in equal measure . a damning appraisal of the un " justice should be of the utmost importance in this organization and according to its charter , all member states should have the same rights , " he told the united nations assembly during his first speech at the un .
" bigger power or bigger wealth should not provide any member with more rights than any other . " his speech set a precedent for bating the un .
as tensions increased over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad resolutely rejected every compromise offered as an unreasonable capitulation .
he then further angered the international community by ostentatiously celebrating iran 's first successful enrichment of uranium . at the same time , ahmadinejad opened a second front by launching scathing attacks on israel , quoting the revolutionary leader ayatollah khomeini by stating the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and adding his own words on holocaust denial . holocaust denial caused outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad favors explosive rhetoric " if the europeans say that they killed 6 million jews in the second world war ; if you have really burned 6 million jews in the ovens … and this seems to be correct because you maintain this over and over again and punish everybody which is of another opinion , you even condemn your scholars who are of another opinion … .so , we ask you : if you have really committed this big crime - why should the suppressed palestinian people be punished for it ?

speaking at a rally in the province of lorestan in march , ahmadinejad showed again how easy it was to get the iranian people on side - by showing that he was one of them . his simple lifestyle and his ability to distance himself from the corruption that has dogged many other politicians in his country adds credibility to his " man of the people " approach and sets him apart from his predecessors . these qualities and this approach were the primary forces behind ahmadinejad 's election victory on june 25 , 2005 .
in only the second round of the ballot , ahmadinejad secured 61 percent of the vote to end the challenges of the favorite ali akbar rafsanjani , leading to former parliamentary leader mehdi karroubi accusing the newly anointed president of electoral fraud . such claims and other voices of dissent have been silent for some time .

the qualified engineer-turned-president , who was only two years before made mayor of tehran , made it easier for the man on the street to get cheap loans , buy homes and also health insurance . however , it soon became clear that on the domestic front , as well as in the international arena , ahmadinejad would be no trouble-free president .

parrots are practically the new chihuahuas .
dw-world.de - your fashion-conscious news source - is heading the trend in bringing you the latest and juiciest bits from the fascinating world of name-dropping birds . as an animal , you ca n't go any higher in the fashion world than becoming a must-have accessory of the cutting-edge tokyo teenage fashion mafia .
parrots are yet to achieve the cult status of the taco bell dog , but - judging by the recent media coverage - they seem to have taken their first steps on the way to stardom . hats off to parrots .
for centuries , they 've been stuck with a single , utterly demeaning and confidence-crushing role of a pirate 's sidekick .
year after year , generation after generation , they 've been hanging out exclusively with men who call themselves captain randal chumbucket , no-eyes herb or jelly-legs wade ; the seafaring demimonde whose fashion accoutrement consists of a peg leg , an eye patch and a hook ; and pre-metrosexual creatures who never shave or bathe , let alone condition or exfoliate . but those days are over .
all of a sudden , parrots are all the rage . " i wanna hold you and hug you and call you george " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , no language lab will be complete without a course in parrot phonology only days after a parrot in the german city of koblenz earned his celebrity status by almost getting its owner arrested when one elderly lady mistook its voice for that of a neglected child - yelling " mother !
mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time . " the birds definitely use a particular call exclusively with a particular bird and never for any other birds , " says rolf wanker , head of the hamburg university zoological institute 's behavioral research lab . " what is not yet clear , however , is whether these calls can be equated with what we would call names such as hans or fritz or whether they could be more generic labels such as ' my baby ' or ' my mate , " ' wanker said . a rose by any other name … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star chef jamie " fresh herbs " oliver is also creative when it comes to children 's names first of all , if parrots were giving conventional names to their children , one would certainly hope that they would be a little more inventive than hans or fritz .

parrots are practically the new chihuahuas .
dw-world.de - your fashion-conscious news source - is heading the trend in bringing you the latest and juiciest bits from the fascinating world of name-dropping birds . as an animal , you ca n't go any higher in the fashion world than becoming a must-have accessory of the cutting-edge tokyo teenage fashion mafia .
parrots are yet to achieve the cult status of the taco bell dog , but - judging by the recent media coverage - they seem to have taken their first steps on the way to stardom . hats off to parrots .
for centuries , they 've been stuck with a single , utterly demeaning and confidence-crushing role of a pirate 's sidekick .
year after year , generation after generation , they 've been hanging out exclusively with men who call themselves captain randal chumbucket , no-eyes herb or jelly-legs wade ; the seafaring demimonde whose fashion accoutrement consists of a peg leg , an eye patch and a hook ; and pre-metrosexual creatures who never shave or bathe , let alone condition or exfoliate . but those days are over .
all of a sudden , parrots are all the rage . " i wanna hold you and hug you and call you george " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , no language lab will be complete without a course in parrot phonology only days after a parrot in the german city of koblenz earned his celebrity status by almost getting its owner arrested when one elderly lady mistook its voice for that of a neglected child - yelling " mother !
mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time . " the birds definitely use a particular call exclusively with a particular bird and never for any other birds , " says rolf wanker , head of the hamburg university zoological institute 's behavioral research lab . " what is not yet clear , however , is whether these calls can be equated with what we would call names such as hans or fritz or whether they could be more generic labels such as ' my baby ' or ' my mate , " ' wanker said . a rose by any other name … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star chef jamie " fresh herbs " oliver is also creative when it comes to children 's names first of all , if parrots were giving conventional names to their children , one would certainly hope that they would be a little more inventive than hans or fritz .
no respectable avian wants to call their children hans or fritz .
if they did , they would be the laughing stock of the entire tropical forest . judging by their fabulous , flashy attire , parrots would probably go for something more exotic and glamorous - like all celebrities do .
just ask dweezle -lrb- zappa -rrb- , fifi-trixibelle -lrb- geldof -rrb- , jermajesty -lrb- jackson -rrb- or daisy boo -lrb- oliver -rrb- . and if they had to chose a german name , they would - in order to raise the community intellectual bar a notch higher - probably do it in the fashion of tommy lee jones by calling the parrot chick something along the lines of kafka lee jones . what are they talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parrots are slowly breaking out of the shackles of history secondly , if parrots are using generic labels , we ca n't be too sure that they are actually using affectionate platitudes such as " honey " or " sweetie . "
for all we know , they could be hurling profanities at each other , telling their kids to shut up for once or uttering cries of parental despair -lrb- " shive me timbers ! " -rrb-
centuries of piracy must have left some kind of cultural trace on the species . other studies have shown that birds develop regional " accents " and " dialects " as well .
in the united states , sparrows on the east coast can laugh for days when one of the local clowns starts imitating their distant cousins from the south . the discovery by german scientists remains , nonetheless , a fascinating one .
too bad the elderly lady from koblenz , who called law enforcement because she did n't realize she was eavesdropping on the neighbor 's parrot , did n't know about it . yo-ho-ho .
and a bottle of rum . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mama , can you hear me ?
television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .
this is a story about a neighborhood-watching german lady who also may have watched too much court tv .
-lrb- july 31 , 2006 -rrb- the best of " from the fringe " from expensive , second-hand chewing gum to strange ferrari auctions , from friendly berliners to the other tennis player named b. becker , from exotic " summer hole " stars to wheelchair cons , we 've gathered a selection of our " from the fringe " stories so you 'll always be up to date on the quirkiest news items to come out of germany .
call it like it is despite germany 's restrictive laws on acceptable names for children , quirky ones squeak through .

his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .
he presented kundry -lrb- evelyn herlitzius -rrb- , a helper to the knight searching for the holy grail , as a fundamentalist islamic fighter clad in black . " it may be a lot to expect of the people in the expensive seats , " the avant-garde producer said about his first opera in an interview with german news agency dpa thursday , " but i have reconciled nietzsche with wagner by negating wagner 's silly buddhist dream .

only the two producers - schlingensief and tankred dorst - have ruffled feathers and polarized critics . wagner 's parsifal is loosely based on wolfram von eschenbach 's middle high german epic parzival .
the work by the 12th century poet , probably inspired by chrétien de troyes ' perceval in french , is the first known german composition to thematicize the holy grail . it is speculated that wagner created a word play by changing the spelling of the epic : " parsi " is similar to the persian word for " persian " and " fal " is close to the german and english word " fall , " thus alluding to a " fall of the persians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.08.2006 german health care reform : mission impossible ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care system needs some major surgery - it 's not getting it chancellor angela merkel put health care reform at the top of her government 's agenda .
but the reform plan she 's released has been roundly condemned and even brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets . germany has one of the best health care systems in the world , but experts have said for years that it wo n't stay that way unless it is substantially reformed .
the system faces a massive budget shortfall , largely due to a financing structure that no longer works in today 's germany due to rising costs , low birth rates and stubbornly high unemployment . a reform plan hammered out by merkel 's coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and conservative christian democrats was released last month to the public and immediately was subjected to scathing criticism by everyone from health care providers , unions and analysts to business leaders and even parts of merkel 's own government . it brought health care employees onto the streets , protesting at what they fear will be huge job losses , and sparked a highly visible feud between the heads of public health insurance companies and german health minister ulla schmidt , who has threatened to use legal means to punish those companies if they use patients ' health care contributions to fund a campaign critical of the government 's plan . the whole thing has left most members of the public shaking their heads , unsure of what the changes mean or if the high-quality health care to which they 've become accustomed is terminally ill . the problem germany 's health care system consists of 252 public health insurance companies , which cover almost 90 percent of the population , about 73 million people .
the other 10 percent – mostly high earners and the self-employed - are covered by private insurance plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no magic pill to make it all better , unfortunately the system is funded by contributions from employers and employees , who pay just under 14 percent of their salaries into it .
still , next year , there will be an expected shortfall of 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " there have to be difference sources of revenue .
we 've basically said the financing basis has to be broadened , " said barbara marnach , deputy spokesman of the aok public health plan , one of germany 's largest , which began lobbying hard as politicians took up the health care reform issue seriously in the spring . july saw the end of months of haggling over how to fill up quickly draining health care coffers , and several competing plans were put forward .
there was talk of introducing a flat health insurance fee , doing away with private plans to bring the well-off – and their money - back into the public fold , raising taxes or increasing employee contribution rates . everyone agreed something had to be done ; no one could agree what that something was .
all the proposals were potential political minefields . the proposed solution instead of raising taxes , which proved politically impossible due to an already scheduled increase in value-added tax in 2007 , the reform plan will ask that employer / employee contributions be increased by 0.5 percent next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will have to start paying for more services that were once covered by basic plans a new " health fund " will be introduced in 2008 into which those contributions will be paid , sweetened with some tax revenues -lrb- 1.5 billion euros in 2008 -rrb- from the federal government , mainly to cover health insurance for children .
the fund will pay out a flat fee , set by the government , for every insured person to the public insurance companies .
previously , individual health plans have collected workers ' contributions on their own . merkel called it a " breakthrough " and health minister schmidt has said it will reduce bureaucracy , boost competition and cut cost in a system which swallows around 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 179 billion -rrb- a year and employs 4.2 million people . the uproar but others are calling it by different names - " wasteful " , for example , saying the plan does little to cure the system 's ailments in the long term .
instead of cutting bureaucracy , it creates a whole new one , said aok 's marnach . " and that means now new organizations and procedures will have to be created , which brings with it more costs , " she said .
" the simple question is , what good is it going to do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's little love lost these days between health minister ulla schmidt and health insurance companies public insurers argue the reform plan runs counter to the goals set out by the government , since it will put more power in the government 's hands and give public insurance companies less ability to compete . " we have n't gotten more authority to act on the free market , rather this reform leads to further socialization .
it will simply be less efficient , " said marnach . some say the proposed reforms are a decent start , given the monumental nature of the task , although they are few .
sophia schlette , head of health care policy for the bertelsmann foundation , says the fears of creating a lumbering new bureaucracy are overblown . " the countries that do better when it comes to costs and various health care indicators are interestingly enough those country that have what here is being described as the horror scenario of the single health fund system , " she told german public radio . it also has some of those four million health insurance company employees worried about their jobs .
last week , 21,000 of them took to the streets in five cities demanding that the government rethink its reform plan , which according to marnach , could lead to a loss of some 25,000 jobs . if not this reform , which ? the reform plan 's vocal critics claim they are not just complaining about change and fully agree that reform is needed - just not this jumble of reforms that no one , not even members of the coalition government , seem particularly happy about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say political realities of germany 's left-right coalition goverment are standing in the way of real reform competing interests and political moves to keep the governing coalition from collapsing in a health care fight are both to blame for the watered-down compromise that was put forward , according to herbert weisbrod-frey , head of the health care policy department at the ver.di service union .

but the reform plan she 's released has been roundly condemned and even brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets . germany has one of the best health care systems in the world , but experts have said for years that it wo n't stay that way unless it is substantially reformed .
the system faces a massive budget shortfall , largely due to a financing structure that no longer works in today 's germany due to rising costs , low birth rates and stubbornly high unemployment . a reform plan hammered out by merkel 's coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and conservative christian democrats was released last month to the public and immediately was subjected to scathing criticism by everyone from health care providers , unions and analysts to business leaders and even parts of merkel 's own government . it brought health care employees onto the streets , protesting at what they fear will be huge job losses , and sparked a highly visible feud between the heads of public health insurance companies and german health minister ulla schmidt , who has threatened to use legal means to punish those companies if they use patients ' health care contributions to fund a campaign critical of the government 's plan . the whole thing has left most members of the public shaking their heads , unsure of what the changes mean or if the high-quality health care to which they 've become accustomed is terminally ill . the problem germany 's health care system consists of 252 public health insurance companies , which cover almost 90 percent of the population , about 73 million people .
the other 10 percent – mostly high earners and the self-employed - are covered by private insurance plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no magic pill to make it all better , unfortunately the system is funded by contributions from employers and employees , who pay just under 14 percent of their salaries into it .

there was talk of introducing a flat health insurance fee , doing away with private plans to bring the well-off – and their money - back into the public fold , raising taxes or increasing employee contribution rates . everyone agreed something had to be done ; no one could agree what that something was .
all the proposals were potential political minefields . the proposed solution instead of raising taxes , which proved politically impossible due to an already scheduled increase in value-added tax in 2007 , the reform plan will ask that employer / employee contributions be increased by 0.5 percent next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will have to start paying for more services that were once covered by basic plans a new " health fund " will be introduced in 2008 into which those contributions will be paid , sweetened with some tax revenues -lrb- 1.5 billion euros in 2008 -rrb- from the federal government , mainly to cover health insurance for children .
the fund will pay out a flat fee , set by the government , for every insured person to the public insurance companies .
previously , individual health plans have collected workers ' contributions on their own . merkel called it a " breakthrough " and health minister schmidt has said it will reduce bureaucracy , boost competition and cut cost in a system which swallows around 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 179 billion -rrb- a year and employs 4.2 million people . the uproar but others are calling it by different names - " wasteful " , for example , saying the plan does little to cure the system 's ailments in the long term .
instead of cutting bureaucracy , it creates a whole new one , said aok 's marnach . " and that means now new organizations and procedures will have to be created , which brings with it more costs , " she said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's little love lost these days between health minister ulla schmidt and health insurance companies public insurers argue the reform plan runs counter to the goals set out by the government , since it will put more power in the government 's hands and give public insurance companies less ability to compete . " we have n't gotten more authority to act on the free market , rather this reform leads to further socialization .
it will simply be less efficient , " said marnach . some say the proposed reforms are a decent start , given the monumental nature of the task , although they are few .
sophia schlette , head of health care policy for the bertelsmann foundation , says the fears of creating a lumbering new bureaucracy are overblown . " the countries that do better when it comes to costs and various health care indicators are interestingly enough those country that have what here is being described as the horror scenario of the single health fund system , " she told german public radio . it also has some of those four million health insurance company employees worried about their jobs .

but the reform plan she 's released has been roundly condemned and even brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets . germany has one of the best health care systems in the world , but experts have said for years that it wo n't stay that way unless it is substantially reformed .
the system faces a massive budget shortfall , largely due to a financing structure that no longer works in today 's germany due to rising costs , low birth rates and stubbornly high unemployment . a reform plan hammered out by merkel 's coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and conservative christian democrats was released last month to the public and immediately was subjected to scathing criticism by everyone from health care providers , unions and analysts to business leaders and even parts of merkel 's own government . it brought health care employees onto the streets , protesting at what they fear will be huge job losses , and sparked a highly visible feud between the heads of public health insurance companies and german health minister ulla schmidt , who has threatened to use legal means to punish those companies if they use patients ' health care contributions to fund a campaign critical of the government 's plan . the whole thing has left most members of the public shaking their heads , unsure of what the changes mean or if the high-quality health care to which they 've become accustomed is terminally ill . the problem germany 's health care system consists of 252 public health insurance companies , which cover almost 90 percent of the population , about 73 million people .
the other 10 percent – mostly high earners and the self-employed - are covered by private insurance plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no magic pill to make it all better , unfortunately the system is funded by contributions from employers and employees , who pay just under 14 percent of their salaries into it .
still , next year , there will be an expected shortfall of 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " there have to be difference sources of revenue .
we 've basically said the financing basis has to be broadened , " said barbara marnach , deputy spokesman of the aok public health plan , one of germany 's largest , which began lobbying hard as politicians took up the health care reform issue seriously in the spring . july saw the end of months of haggling over how to fill up quickly draining health care coffers , and several competing plans were put forward .
there was talk of introducing a flat health insurance fee , doing away with private plans to bring the well-off – and their money - back into the public fold , raising taxes or increasing employee contribution rates . everyone agreed something had to be done ; no one could agree what that something was .
all the proposals were potential political minefields . the proposed solution instead of raising taxes , which proved politically impossible due to an already scheduled increase in value-added tax in 2007 , the reform plan will ask that employer / employee contributions be increased by 0.5 percent next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will have to start paying for more services that were once covered by basic plans a new " health fund " will be introduced in 2008 into which those contributions will be paid , sweetened with some tax revenues -lrb- 1.5 billion euros in 2008 -rrb- from the federal government , mainly to cover health insurance for children .

" viktor yushchenko emerged from talks in the early hours of thursday morning to announce that the main obstacles had finally been overcome in negotiations that followed march 's parliamentary elections . " i have decided to put forward the candidacy of viktor yushchenko for the post of prime minister , " yushchenko told journalists . yushchenko said he realized submitting his former rival 's name for nomination could cause a misunderstanding among members of the mass " orange revolution " protests , which were responsible for ousting yanukovych two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko said he understood some would be upset with his decision " i ask people to understand that we have a unique chance about which we talked about on independence square , about which we dreamed every day - to unite both sides of the dniper -lrb- river -rrb- in understanding , " yushchenko said , referring to the kiev square that was the center of the orange revolution mass protests and to the river that bisects ukraine . " we have a good chance to escape the political war and pass to political competition , " yushchenko added . other than accepting yanukovych 's candidacy , yushchenko 's only other viable option would have been to dissolve parliament and hope to win new elections while prolonging the crisis that has gripped ukraine since march . he said a pact agreed with yanukovych 's pro-russian regions party would be signed later thursday and would ensure that the country kept to its current pro-western course .
a politician with close ties to the kremlin and big business , yanukovych shares few of revolution 's reforming ideals . a n e n d to draw n out n egotiatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych is seen as an economic pragmatist without going into the details , the ukrainian president said part of the deal with his rival included written promises that yanukovych would not try to turn around the country 's attempts at market reforms or european integration . " concerning the principles determining ukraine 's domestic and foreign policy , its continuity , we have made a full stop today , " yushchenko said .
" i am sure that there will be no more discussions . " yanukovych 's regions party won the most seats at the elections , picking up support in the pro-russian east of the country and opposing yushchenko 's plans for ukraine to join the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- , but it failed to win an overall majority . there were no immediate comments from regions on how it planned to cooperate with yushchenko nor details on the likely distribution of cabinet seats . tymoshe n ko 's place still up i n the air thursday 's talks had extended beyond a constitutional deadline of 15 days for yushchenko to decide either to approve yanukovych 's candidacy or dissolve parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko said she fears the effects of a pro-russian government yanukovych , a 56-year-old former electrician from ukraine 's industrial east , served as prime minister between 2002 and 2004 but was forced to back down from a presidential bid when hundreds of thousands of people staged peaceful protests against the election result . in the recent negotiations yushchenko 's glamorous " orange revolution " ally , yulia tymoshenko , opposed a return to power by pro-russian forces , saying it would be better to dissolve parliament than " betray " those who came onto the streets . the idea of ukrainian membership of the european union and nato has prompted consternation in moscow , which has long considered ukraine part of its sphere of influence . despite warnings that the crisis could deter much-needed investment , the economy has picked up recently .

the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .
but this year , the 18-strong board was convening in person at the ecb 's eurotower headquarters in frankfurt , a sure sign that a move in interest rates was on the cards . the meeting was also attended by eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . worries about inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president jean-claude trichet said the rate could go up even further in the future inflationary risks are rising in the 12-country euro zone , primarily as a result of high oil prices , european central bank president jean-claude trichet said on thursday . " the risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented , " the ecb chief told a news conference after the increase was announced . the main risks included " further increases in oil prices , a stronger-than-anticipated pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices , and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , " the frenchman said . he added that euro-zone interest rates are likely to be rise still further . with area-wide growth currently above trend , inflation above target and credit and money supply growth accelerating strongly , the ecb believes higher borrowing costs are necessary to nip inflation the bud . area-wide inflation stood at 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in june , far above the ecb 's ceiling of 2.0 percent , fuelled by runaway energy prices . the bank is concerned that energy price developments may trigger so-called " second-round " effects , with demands for higher wages to compensate for the high price of petrol and heating oil leading to an inflation spiral . as yet , there is no sign of that happening , but the ecb believes that prevention is better than cure . about time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sky-high energy prices have economists worried commerzbank chief economist jörg krämer said the tightening move on thursday was " long overdue " . " the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum . " in recent months , economic activity in the euro area , and in germany in particular , has increasingly gained strength , " glos said in a short statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers find world cup triggers stock market response like many a soccer ball in germany right now , the german stock market has been bouncing up and down and round this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.08.2006 european central bank raises rates on inflation fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's gotten more expensive to borrow money in europe the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised the key euro-zone interest rate by a quarter point to 3.0 percent on thursday , making borrowing costs the highest in three-and-a-half years in order to curb inflation . as widely expected , the ecb decided to raise its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to 3.00 percent , the highest level since december 2002 , to counter inflationary high oil prices and accelerating economic growth . less than an hour earlier , the bank of england had also tightened its monetary policy , raising its own key rate for the first time in a year by 0.25 percentage points to 4.75 percent . the ecb 's move is the fourth quarter-point rise in euro-zone borrowing costs since december .
the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .
but this year , the 18-strong board was convening in person at the ecb 's eurotower headquarters in frankfurt , a sure sign that a move in interest rates was on the cards . the meeting was also attended by eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . worries about inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president jean-claude trichet said the rate could go up even further in the future inflationary risks are rising in the 12-country euro zone , primarily as a result of high oil prices , european central bank president jean-claude trichet said on thursday . " the risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented , " the ecb chief told a news conference after the increase was announced . the main risks included " further increases in oil prices , a stronger-than-anticipated pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices , and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , " the frenchman said . he added that euro-zone interest rates are likely to be rise still further . with area-wide growth currently above trend , inflation above target and credit and money supply growth accelerating strongly , the ecb believes higher borrowing costs are necessary to nip inflation the bud . area-wide inflation stood at 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in june , far above the ecb 's ceiling of 2.0 percent , fuelled by runaway energy prices . the bank is concerned that energy price developments may trigger so-called " second-round " effects , with demands for higher wages to compensate for the high price of petrol and heating oil leading to an inflation spiral . as yet , there is no sign of that happening , but the ecb believes that prevention is better than cure . about time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sky-high energy prices have economists worried commerzbank chief economist jörg krämer said the tightening move on thursday was " long overdue " . " the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum . " in recent months , economic activity in the euro area , and in germany in particular , has increasingly gained strength , " glos said in a short statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers find world cup triggers stock market response like many a soccer ball in germany right now , the german stock market has been bouncing up and down and round this week .

the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .

" the risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented , " the ecb chief told a news conference after the increase was announced . the main risks included " further increases in oil prices , a stronger-than-anticipated pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices , and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , " the frenchman said . he added that euro-zone interest rates are likely to be rise still further . with area-wide growth currently above trend , inflation above target and credit and money supply growth accelerating strongly , the ecb believes higher borrowing costs are necessary to nip inflation the bud . area-wide inflation stood at 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in june , far above the ecb 's ceiling of 2.0 percent , fuelled by runaway energy prices . the bank is concerned that energy price developments may trigger so-called " second-round " effects , with demands for higher wages to compensate for the high price of petrol and heating oil leading to an inflation spiral . as yet , there is no sign of that happening , but the ecb believes that prevention is better than cure . about time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sky-high energy prices have economists worried commerzbank chief economist jörg krämer said the tightening move on thursday was " long overdue " . " the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the wagner festival in bayreuth drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth " germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy " bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.08.2006 schlingensief 's " parsifal " deepens divide at wagner festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religious symbols abound in schlingensief 's " parsifal " christoph schlingensief 's controversial rendition of " parsifal " concluded the first round of the program at the wagner festival wednesday in what may be the most daring production to come from bayreuth . after monday 's conclusion to the first complete performance of the ring cycle on bayreuth 's " green hill " brought mixed reviews , christoph schlingensief 's controversial production of parsifal deepened the divide wednesday . the 45-year-old german director was met with boos , but also applause when he appeared on stage after the performance .
his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .
he presented kundry -lrb- evelyn herlitzius -rrb- , a helper to the knight searching for the holy grail , as a fundamentalist islamic fighter clad in black . " it may be a lot to expect of the people in the expensive seats , " the avant-garde producer said about his first opera in an interview with german news agency dpa thursday , " but i have reconciled nietzsche with wagner by negating wagner 's silly buddhist dream . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alfons eberz is parsifal , left , and robert holl is gurnemanz a biography of the producer that appears on his personal web site describes him as " a moralist with messages of an almost biblical tone " who " creates a permanent state of insecurity by blurring borders between reality and fiction , art and offense , intention and action . " in the interview , schlingensief added that , despite any controversy and " insecurity " that may have arisen , the festival heads had given his production " a high artistic rating , " which " would n't have been possible after the premiere in 2004 . "
then again , he has thoroughly reworked the opera since then . parsifal was the self-proclaimed wagner fan 's first opera production .
he said he now finds opera more exciting than theater and does n't exclude the possibility of returning to bayreuth for another project in the future . once again , applause for musical excellence hungarian-born conductor adam fischer , who conducted the ring in bayreuth from 2001 to 2004 , was praised by critics for a " precise , " even " consecrated " performance , though he may have " lacked tension " at times . as in the ring , both the conductor and the singers came away with high marks .
only the two producers - schlingensief and tankred dorst - have ruffled feathers and polarized critics . wagner 's parsifal is loosely based on wolfram von eschenbach 's middle high german epic parzival .

his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .
he presented kundry -lrb- evelyn herlitzius -rrb- , a helper to the knight searching for the holy grail , as a fundamentalist islamic fighter clad in black . " it may be a lot to expect of the people in the expensive seats , " the avant-garde producer said about his first opera in an interview with german news agency dpa thursday , " but i have reconciled nietzsche with wagner by negating wagner 's silly buddhist dream . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alfons eberz is parsifal , left , and robert holl is gurnemanz a biography of the producer that appears on his personal web site describes him as " a moralist with messages of an almost biblical tone " who " creates a permanent state of insecurity by blurring borders between reality and fiction , art and offense , intention and action . " in the interview , schlingensief added that , despite any controversy and " insecurity " that may have arisen , the festival heads had given his production " a high artistic rating , " which " would n't have been possible after the premiere in 2004 . "
then again , he has thoroughly reworked the opera since then . parsifal was the self-proclaimed wagner fan 's first opera production .
he said he now finds opera more exciting than theater and does n't exclude the possibility of returning to bayreuth for another project in the future . once again , applause for musical excellence hungarian-born conductor adam fischer , who conducted the ring in bayreuth from 2001 to 2004 , was praised by critics for a " precise , " even " consecrated " performance , though he may have " lacked tension " at times . as in the ring , both the conductor and the singers came away with high marks .
only the two producers - schlingensief and tankred dorst - have ruffled feathers and polarized critics . wagner 's parsifal is loosely based on wolfram von eschenbach 's middle high german epic parzival .
the work by the 12th century poet , probably inspired by chrétien de troyes ' perceval in french , is the first known german composition to thematicize the holy grail . it is speculated that wagner created a word play by changing the spelling of the epic : " parsi " is similar to the persian word for " persian " and " fal " is close to the german and english word " fall , " thus alluding to a " fall of the persians .

one year on , deutsche welle 's peter philipp looks back on ahmadinejad 's impact on his country and on the wider international community . " even if our ministry of finance , our bank accounts and our households should be empty one day , as god is my witness , ahmadinejad and his government are ready to come here and work with their hands to build up lorestan .
we would be proud to do it . " it was another example of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's skill at gathering the population to him and whipping them into a frenzy of support with populist rhetoric .
speaking at a rally in the province of lorestan in march , ahmadinejad showed again how easy it was to get the iranian people on side - by showing that he was one of them . his simple lifestyle and his ability to distance himself from the corruption that has dogged many other politicians in his country adds credibility to his " man of the people " approach and sets him apart from his predecessors . these qualities and this approach were the primary forces behind ahmadinejad 's election victory on june 25 , 2005 .
in only the second round of the ballot , ahmadinejad secured 61 percent of the vote to end the challenges of the favorite ali akbar rafsanjani , leading to former parliamentary leader mehdi karroubi accusing the newly anointed president of electoral fraud . such claims and other voices of dissent have been silent for some time .
ahmadinejad became the islamic republic 's sixth president last year on aug .
3 ; since then , his words and actions have made his country and the wider world captive audiences . usa : ahmadinejad 's public enemy no.1 with populist outpourings , virulent anti-israeli and anti-american rhetoric and a self-confident and provocative posture in the crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad has created more foreign policy problems for his country in just one year than any of his predecessors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a point of antagonizing bush the target of most of his vitriol is the west and , specifically , the united states : " they accuse our people of violating human rights and freedom .
if god wants it , we will put -lrb- the americans -rrb- before people 's courts .
our people have culture and civilization ; ours are free and revolutionary people . " these people were promised a remedy for the unfulfilled hopes and the underprivileged existence of many of their number after ahmadinejad 's election victory .
the qualified engineer-turned-president , who was only two years before made mayor of tehran , made it easier for the man on the street to get cheap loans , buy homes and also health insurance . however , it soon became clear that on the domestic front , as well as in the international arena , ahmadinejad would be no trouble-free president .
he appointed old companions from his time with the revolutionary guards in ministerial and other posts - some of whom he then had to replace again after embarrassing displays of incompetence - and he began to distinguish himself in the wider world , making enemies and friends in equal measure . a damning appraisal of the un " justice should be of the utmost importance in this organization and according to its charter , all member states should have the same rights , " he told the united nations assembly during his first speech at the un .
" bigger power or bigger wealth should not provide any member with more rights than any other . " his speech set a precedent for bating the un .
as tensions increased over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad resolutely rejected every compromise offered as an unreasonable capitulation .
he then further angered the international community by ostentatiously celebrating iran 's first successful enrichment of uranium . at the same time , ahmadinejad opened a second front by launching scathing attacks on israel , quoting the revolutionary leader ayatollah khomeini by stating the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and adding his own words on holocaust denial . holocaust denial caused outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad favors explosive rhetoric " if the europeans say that they killed 6 million jews in the second world war ; if you have really burned 6 million jews in the ovens … and this seems to be correct because you maintain this over and over again and punish everybody which is of another opinion , you even condemn your scholars who are of another opinion … .so , we ask you : if you have really committed this big crime - why should the suppressed palestinian people be punished for it ? " " if you have committed a crime , you yourselves should pay for it .
our suggestion remains unchanged : if you have committed a crime , it is only right that you make part of your own land available - in europe , the usa , canada or alaska - and establish -lrb- a jewish state -rrb- there .
you could be assured that the iranian people have nothing against it . " ahmadinejad 's comments caused an international storm of outrage , which gave the iranian president the affirmation he needed to increase his attacks .
he compared the us administration , for example , to genghis khan and then likened israel to hitler 's third reich .
in the muslim world , ahmadinejad scored many points with his provocation , even in arab countries which had a natural distrust of iran but saw he was a man of conviction who was ready to take on the us and israel . stance has further alienated iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attitudes to iran in the west have hardened catastrophically , that loathing and irritation of the west colored the nuclear question and the west 's posture towards iran began to harden . a year after mahmoud ahmadinejad took office ; he has inspired much debate and has acquired mass support in his own country but has consequently painted iran into a corner .
if one is searching for a reason why , the most logical explanation would be that ahmadinejad would like to restore the atmosphere of the early islamic republic .

parrots are practically the new chihuahuas .
dw-world.de - your fashion-conscious news source - is heading the trend in bringing you the latest and juiciest bits from the fascinating world of name-dropping birds . as an animal , you ca n't go any higher in the fashion world than becoming a must-have accessory of the cutting-edge tokyo teenage fashion mafia .
parrots are yet to achieve the cult status of the taco bell dog , but - judging by the recent media coverage - they seem to have taken their first steps on the way to stardom . hats off to parrots .
for centuries , they 've been stuck with a single , utterly demeaning and confidence-crushing role of a pirate 's sidekick .
year after year , generation after generation , they 've been hanging out exclusively with men who call themselves captain randal chumbucket , no-eyes herb or jelly-legs wade ; the seafaring demimonde whose fashion accoutrement consists of a peg leg , an eye patch and a hook ; and pre-metrosexual creatures who never shave or bathe , let alone condition or exfoliate . but those days are over .
all of a sudden , parrots are all the rage . " i wanna hold you and hug you and call you george " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , no language lab will be complete without a course in parrot phonology only days after a parrot in the german city of koblenz earned his celebrity status by almost getting its owner arrested when one elderly lady mistook its voice for that of a neglected child - yelling " mother !
mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time . " the birds definitely use a particular call exclusively with a particular bird and never for any other birds , " says rolf wanker , head of the hamburg university zoological institute 's behavioral research lab . " what is not yet clear , however , is whether these calls can be equated with what we would call names such as hans or fritz or whether they could be more generic labels such as ' my baby ' or ' my mate , " ' wanker said . a rose by any other name … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star chef jamie " fresh herbs " oliver is also creative when it comes to children 's names first of all , if parrots were giving conventional names to their children , one would certainly hope that they would be a little more inventive than hans or fritz .
no respectable avian wants to call their children hans or fritz .
if they did , they would be the laughing stock of the entire tropical forest . judging by their fabulous , flashy attire , parrots would probably go for something more exotic and glamorous - like all celebrities do .
just ask dweezle -lrb- zappa -rrb- , fifi-trixibelle -lrb- geldof -rrb- , jermajesty -lrb- jackson -rrb- or daisy boo -lrb- oliver -rrb- . and if they had to chose a german name , they would - in order to raise the community intellectual bar a notch higher - probably do it in the fashion of tommy lee jones by calling the parrot chick something along the lines of kafka lee jones . what are they talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parrots are slowly breaking out of the shackles of history secondly , if parrots are using generic labels , we ca n't be too sure that they are actually using affectionate platitudes such as " honey " or " sweetie . "
for all we know , they could be hurling profanities at each other , telling their kids to shut up for once or uttering cries of parental despair -lrb- " shive me timbers ! " -rrb-
centuries of piracy must have left some kind of cultural trace on the species . other studies have shown that birds develop regional " accents " and " dialects " as well .
in the united states , sparrows on the east coast can laugh for days when one of the local clowns starts imitating their distant cousins from the south . the discovery by german scientists remains , nonetheless , a fascinating one .
too bad the elderly lady from koblenz , who called law enforcement because she did n't realize she was eavesdropping on the neighbor 's parrot , did n't know about it . yo-ho-ho .

television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.08.2006 european central bank raises rates on inflation fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's gotten more expensive to borrow money in europe the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised the key euro-zone interest rate by a quarter point to 3.0 percent on thursday , making borrowing costs the highest in three-and-a-half years in order to curb inflation . as widely expected , the ecb decided to raise its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to 3.00 percent , the highest level since december 2002 , to counter inflationary high oil prices and accelerating economic growth . less than an hour earlier , the bank of england had also tightened its monetary policy , raising its own key rate for the first time in a year by 0.25 percentage points to 4.75 percent . the ecb 's move is the fourth quarter-point rise in euro-zone borrowing costs since december .
the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .
but this year , the 18-strong board was convening in person at the ecb 's eurotower headquarters in frankfurt , a sure sign that a move in interest rates was on the cards . the meeting was also attended by eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . worries about inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president jean-claude trichet said the rate could go up even further in the future inflationary risks are rising in the 12-country euro zone , primarily as a result of high oil prices , european central bank president jean-claude trichet said on thursday .

his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .
he presented kundry -lrb- evelyn herlitzius -rrb- , a helper to the knight searching for the holy grail , as a fundamentalist islamic fighter clad in black . " it may be a lot to expect of the people in the expensive seats , " the avant-garde producer said about his first opera in an interview with german news agency dpa thursday , " but i have reconciled nietzsche with wagner by negating wagner 's silly buddhist dream . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alfons eberz is parsifal , left , and robert holl is gurnemanz a biography of the producer that appears on his personal web site describes him as " a moralist with messages of an almost biblical tone " who " creates a permanent state of insecurity by blurring borders between reality and fiction , art and offense , intention and action . " in the interview , schlingensief added that , despite any controversy and " insecurity " that may have arisen , the festival heads had given his production " a high artistic rating , " which " would n't have been possible after the premiere in 2004 . "
then again , he has thoroughly reworked the opera since then . parsifal was the self-proclaimed wagner fan 's first opera production .
he said he now finds opera more exciting than theater and does n't exclude the possibility of returning to bayreuth for another project in the future . once again , applause for musical excellence hungarian-born conductor adam fischer , who conducted the ring in bayreuth from 2001 to 2004 , was praised by critics for a " precise , " even " consecrated " performance , though he may have " lacked tension " at times . as in the ring , both the conductor and the singers came away with high marks .
only the two producers - schlingensief and tankred dorst - have ruffled feathers and polarized critics . wagner 's parsifal is loosely based on wolfram von eschenbach 's middle high german epic parzival .
the work by the 12th century poet , probably inspired by chrétien de troyes ' perceval in french , is the first known german composition to thematicize the holy grail . it is speculated that wagner created a word play by changing the spelling of the epic : " parsi " is similar to the persian word for " persian " and " fal " is close to the german and english word " fall , " thus alluding to a " fall of the persians . " competition strategies for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief made a few revisions since the 2004 version shown here this parsifal rendition is certainly the most unusual production ever to be performed in bayreuth , wrote news agency dpa thursday .
other opera companies also perform wagner and , in spite of the advantage of having a long tradition , the bayreuth festival has to remain competitive . shortened runtimes for new productions should also add to the festival 's competitive edge by allowing for a greater sense of novelty in the program .
parsifal will be remade in 2008 , but it is unclear who will be entrusted with the production . the next fresh addition to look forward to is katharina wagner 's production of the mastersingers of nuremberg , planned to premiere in 2007 .
she is the daughter of the current festival director , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , and richard wagner 's great-granddaughter .
katharina 's bayreuth debut will be closely observed , as she is likely to succeed her father in running the festival . wednesday 's performance of parsifal concluded the first round of operas at this year 's wagner festival .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the wagner festival in bayreuth drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth " germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy " bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.08.2006 schlingensief 's " parsifal " deepens divide at wagner festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religious symbols abound in schlingensief 's " parsifal " christoph schlingensief 's controversial rendition of " parsifal " concluded the first round of the program at the wagner festival wednesday in what may be the most daring production to come from bayreuth . after monday 's conclusion to the first complete performance of the ring cycle on bayreuth 's " green hill " brought mixed reviews , christoph schlingensief 's controversial production of parsifal deepened the divide wednesday . the 45-year-old german director was met with boos , but also applause when he appeared on stage after the performance .
his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .
he presented kundry -lrb- evelyn herlitzius -rrb- , a helper to the knight searching for the holy grail , as a fundamentalist islamic fighter clad in black . " it may be a lot to expect of the people in the expensive seats , " the avant-garde producer said about his first opera in an interview with german news agency dpa thursday , " but i have reconciled nietzsche with wagner by negating wagner 's silly buddhist dream . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alfons eberz is parsifal , left , and robert holl is gurnemanz a biography of the producer that appears on his personal web site describes him as " a moralist with messages of an almost biblical tone " who " creates a permanent state of insecurity by blurring borders between reality and fiction , art and offense , intention and action . " in the interview , schlingensief added that , despite any controversy and " insecurity " that may have arisen , the festival heads had given his production " a high artistic rating , " which " would n't have been possible after the premiere in 2004 . "
then again , he has thoroughly reworked the opera since then . parsifal was the self-proclaimed wagner fan 's first opera production .
he said he now finds opera more exciting than theater and does n't exclude the possibility of returning to bayreuth for another project in the future . once again , applause for musical excellence hungarian-born conductor adam fischer , who conducted the ring in bayreuth from 2001 to 2004 , was praised by critics for a " precise , " even " consecrated " performance , though he may have " lacked tension " at times . as in the ring , both the conductor and the singers came away with high marks .
only the two producers - schlingensief and tankred dorst - have ruffled feathers and polarized critics . wagner 's parsifal is loosely based on wolfram von eschenbach 's middle high german epic parzival .
the work by the 12th century poet , probably inspired by chrétien de troyes ' perceval in french , is the first known german composition to thematicize the holy grail . it is speculated that wagner created a word play by changing the spelling of the epic : " parsi " is similar to the persian word for " persian " and " fal " is close to the german and english word " fall , " thus alluding to a " fall of the persians . " competition strategies for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief made a few revisions since the 2004 version shown here this parsifal rendition is certainly the most unusual production ever to be performed in bayreuth , wrote news agency dpa thursday .
other opera companies also perform wagner and , in spite of the advantage of having a long tradition , the bayreuth festival has to remain competitive . shortened runtimes for new productions should also add to the festival 's competitive edge by allowing for a greater sense of novelty in the program .
parsifal will be remade in 2008 , but it is unclear who will be entrusted with the production . the next fresh addition to look forward to is katharina wagner 's production of the mastersingers of nuremberg , planned to premiere in 2007 .
she is the daughter of the current festival director , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , and richard wagner 's great-granddaughter .
katharina 's bayreuth debut will be closely observed , as she is likely to succeed her father in running the festival . wednesday 's performance of parsifal concluded the first round of operas at this year 's wagner festival .
the ring , the flying dutchman , tristan and isolde and parsifal will be repeated in a total of 22 more performances until the festival ends on august 28 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth the first " ring " cycle concluded monday to mixed reviews and a polarized audience .
most agree , however , that conductor christian thielemann and the singers saved the underdeveloped production .

2 , 2006 -rrb- debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth nike wagner , the niece of bayreuth festival director wolfgang wagner , advocated cuts to the opera festival 's state subsidies .
her appeal aggravated family tensions , but raised valid questions on german art subsidies .
-lrb- july 27 , 2006 -rrb- " germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy " culture researcher andreas wiesand talked with dw-world.de about the wagner family " soap opera " and said that germany 's arts subsidies are deeply rooted in history so the general public does n't question them .

" no country denies iran 's right , " he said during the discussions in tehran , adding that only confidence-building measures were required to make a difference in the disintegrating relationship between iran and the west .

" no country denies iran 's right , " he said during the discussions in tehran , adding that only confidence-building measures were required to make a difference in the disintegrating relationship between iran and the west . " if such confidence-building is realized , great advantages either in terms of peaceful use of nuclear energy or in other political and economic domains would be provided for iran , " fischer added . ira n should help build co n fide n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with iran 's former negotiator hossein mousavian " if iran cooperates in confidence-building matters - as the un security council and the international atomic energy agency have requested - europe and all permanent members of the un security council would be ready to support iran 's right to peaceful use of nuclear energy . " " if iran cooperates with the international community , it will be the big winner , " he said " europe has accepted iran 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and respects the right , but iran 's hasty construction of heavy water reactor in arak and enrichment of uranium up to the level of 3.5 percent have worried europe . " fischer told the assembled academics and diplomats at the meeting that the west feared that an iran armed with nuclear weapons might prompt other regional states to enter into a race to acquire nuclear arms .
he warned that , as a result , the region could turn into a warehouse of nuclear weapons , which would be extremely detrimental to peace , stability and security in the middle east region . weapo n s fear must be removed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has been stepping up missile tests this year " relieving such a concern would be in favor of iran-europe relations , " he said .
" europe is ready to use all its capacity to support iran 's peaceful nuclear technology and cooperate with the country . " fischer explained that iran was facing an important moment in its history .
it could choose to take on a large and outstanding role in the middle east and the world , and assume a leading role in protecting peace , stability and security in the region , or choose to be a detrimental force , complicating and exacerbating its problems .
the country 's choice , he said , could be influenced by how other nations treat iran . " this is the time for clever diplomacy , " he said .
" in essence this will depend on the united states ' conduct towards iran .
and here there is cause for skepticism . " iran would also have to meet the west halfway to ensure a peaceful resolution to the nuclear stand-off . curre n t ira n sta n ce " clearly n egative " in the interview in thursday 's süddeutsche zeitu n g , fischer said that tehran 's current stance had given him " little cause for optimism " and that " iran 's official announcements on the un resolution are clearly negative . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad said iran would not bow to " force and threats " the un security council gave iran until aug .
31 to halt its controversial nuclear enrichment activities , which the west sees as a bid to acquire nuclear weapons .
hard-line iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday vowed that iran would not bow to " force and threats , " while iran 's parliament speaker gholam-ali hadad-adel called the un resolution " worthless . " despite such statements , fischer urged western diplomats to pursue contacts on all levels in iran because " radical and reform-minded politicians are having a heated debate behind closed doors " on the matter . " if the talks start more speedily and even in several phases , the chance for reaching mutual understanding will not be missed , " he added . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer visits iran as calls for a diplomatic role gather pace former german foreign minister joschka fischer began a four-day visit to iran monday as the guest of a tehran think-tank with a growing chorus calling for him to return to the middle east in a more official capacity .

but the reform plan she 's released has been roundly condemned and even brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets . germany has one of the best health care systems in the world , but experts have said for years that it wo n't stay that way unless it is substantially reformed .
the system faces a massive budget shortfall , largely due to a financing structure that no longer works in today 's germany due to rising costs , low birth rates and stubbornly high unemployment . a reform plan hammered out by merkel 's coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and conservative christian democrats was released last month to the public and immediately was subjected to scathing criticism by everyone from health care providers , unions and analysts to business leaders and even parts of merkel 's own government . it brought health care employees onto the streets , protesting at what they fear will be huge job losses , and sparked a highly visible feud between the heads of public health insurance companies and german health minister ulla schmidt , who has threatened to use legal means to punish those companies if they use patients ' health care contributions to fund a campaign critical of the government 's plan . the whole thing has left most members of the public shaking their heads , unsure of what the changes mean or if the high-quality health care to which they 've become accustomed is terminally ill . the problem germany 's health care system consists of 252 public health insurance companies , which cover almost 90 percent of the population , about 73 million people .
the other 10 percent – mostly high earners and the self-employed - are covered by private insurance plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no magic pill to make it all better , unfortunately the system is funded by contributions from employers and employees , who pay just under 14 percent of their salaries into it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.08.2006 german health care reform : mission impossible ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care system needs some major surgery - it 's not getting it chancellor angela merkel put health care reform at the top of her government 's agenda .
but the reform plan she 's released has been roundly condemned and even brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets . germany has one of the best health care systems in the world , but experts have said for years that it wo n't stay that way unless it is substantially reformed .
the system faces a massive budget shortfall , largely due to a financing structure that no longer works in today 's germany due to rising costs , low birth rates and stubbornly high unemployment . a reform plan hammered out by merkel 's coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and conservative christian democrats was released last month to the public and immediately was subjected to scathing criticism by everyone from health care providers , unions and analysts to business leaders and even parts of merkel 's own government . it brought health care employees onto the streets , protesting at what they fear will be huge job losses , and sparked a highly visible feud between the heads of public health insurance companies and german health minister ulla schmidt , who has threatened to use legal means to punish those companies if they use patients ' health care contributions to fund a campaign critical of the government 's plan . the whole thing has left most members of the public shaking their heads , unsure of what the changes mean or if the high-quality health care to which they 've become accustomed is terminally ill . the problem germany 's health care system consists of 252 public health insurance companies , which cover almost 90 percent of the population , about 73 million people .
the other 10 percent – mostly high earners and the self-employed - are covered by private insurance plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no magic pill to make it all better , unfortunately the system is funded by contributions from employers and employees , who pay just under 14 percent of their salaries into it .
still , next year , there will be an expected shortfall of 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " there have to be difference sources of revenue .
we 've basically said the financing basis has to be broadened , " said barbara marnach , deputy spokesman of the aok public health plan , one of germany 's largest , which began lobbying hard as politicians took up the health care reform issue seriously in the spring . july saw the end of months of haggling over how to fill up quickly draining health care coffers , and several competing plans were put forward .
there was talk of introducing a flat health insurance fee , doing away with private plans to bring the well-off – and their money - back into the public fold , raising taxes or increasing employee contribution rates . everyone agreed something had to be done ; no one could agree what that something was .
all the proposals were potential political minefields . the proposed solution instead of raising taxes , which proved politically impossible due to an already scheduled increase in value-added tax in 2007 , the reform plan will ask that employer / employee contributions be increased by 0.5 percent next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will have to start paying for more services that were once covered by basic plans a new " health fund " will be introduced in 2008 into which those contributions will be paid , sweetened with some tax revenues -lrb- 1.5 billion euros in 2008 -rrb- from the federal government , mainly to cover health insurance for children .
the fund will pay out a flat fee , set by the government , for every insured person to the public insurance companies .
previously , individual health plans have collected workers ' contributions on their own . merkel called it a " breakthrough " and health minister schmidt has said it will reduce bureaucracy , boost competition and cut cost in a system which swallows around 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 179 billion -rrb- a year and employs 4.2 million people . the uproar but others are calling it by different names - " wasteful " , for example , saying the plan does little to cure the system 's ailments in the long term .
instead of cutting bureaucracy , it creates a whole new one , said aok 's marnach . " and that means now new organizations and procedures will have to be created , which brings with it more costs , " she said .
" the simple question is , what good is it going to do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's little love lost these days between health minister ulla schmidt and health insurance companies public insurers argue the reform plan runs counter to the goals set out by the government , since it will put more power in the government 's hands and give public insurance companies less ability to compete . " we have n't gotten more authority to act on the free market , rather this reform leads to further socialization .
it will simply be less efficient , " said marnach . some say the proposed reforms are a decent start , given the monumental nature of the task , although they are few .
sophia schlette , head of health care policy for the bertelsmann foundation , says the fears of creating a lumbering new bureaucracy are overblown . " the countries that do better when it comes to costs and various health care indicators are interestingly enough those country that have what here is being described as the horror scenario of the single health fund system , " she told german public radio . it also has some of those four million health insurance company employees worried about their jobs .
last week , 21,000 of them took to the streets in five cities demanding that the government rethink its reform plan , which according to marnach , could lead to a loss of some 25,000 jobs . if not this reform , which ? the reform plan 's vocal critics claim they are not just complaining about change and fully agree that reform is needed - just not this jumble of reforms that no one , not even members of the coalition government , seem particularly happy about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say political realities of germany 's left-right coalition goverment are standing in the way of real reform competing interests and political moves to keep the governing coalition from collapsing in a health care fight are both to blame for the watered-down compromise that was put forward , according to herbert weisbrod-frey , head of the health care policy department at the ver.di service union . " this is causing lots of problems , because this reform is all about political decisions , not decisions that were based on what actual health care experts had to say .

" even if our ministry of finance , our bank accounts and our households should be empty one day , as god is my witness , ahmadinejad and his government are ready to come here and work with their hands to build up lorestan .
we would be proud to do it . " it was another example of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's skill at gathering the population to him and whipping them into a frenzy of support with populist rhetoric .
speaking at a rally in the province of lorestan in march , ahmadinejad showed again how easy it was to get the iranian people on side - by showing that he was one of them . his simple lifestyle and his ability to distance himself from the corruption that has dogged many other politicians in his country adds credibility to his " man of the people " approach and sets him apart from his predecessors . these qualities and this approach were the primary forces behind ahmadinejad 's election victory on june 25 , 2005 .
in only the second round of the ballot , ahmadinejad secured 61 percent of the vote to end the challenges of the favorite ali akbar rafsanjani , leading to former parliamentary leader mehdi karroubi accusing the newly anointed president of electoral fraud . such claims and other voices of dissent have been silent for some time .

the qualified engineer-turned-president , who was only two years before made mayor of tehran , made it easier for the man on the street to get cheap loans , buy homes and also health insurance . however , it soon became clear that on the domestic front , as well as in the international arena , ahmadinejad would be no trouble-free president .

one year on , deutsche welle 's peter philipp looks back on ahmadinejad 's impact on his country and on the wider international community . " even if our ministry of finance , our bank accounts and our households should be empty one day , as god is my witness , ahmadinejad and his government are ready to come here and work with their hands to build up lorestan .
we would be proud to do it . " it was another example of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's skill at gathering the population to him and whipping them into a frenzy of support with populist rhetoric .
speaking at a rally in the province of lorestan in march , ahmadinejad showed again how easy it was to get the iranian people on side - by showing that he was one of them . his simple lifestyle and his ability to distance himself from the corruption that has dogged many other politicians in his country adds credibility to his " man of the people " approach and sets him apart from his predecessors . these qualities and this approach were the primary forces behind ahmadinejad 's election victory on june 25 , 2005 .
in only the second round of the ballot , ahmadinejad secured 61 percent of the vote to end the challenges of the favorite ali akbar rafsanjani , leading to former parliamentary leader mehdi karroubi accusing the newly anointed president of electoral fraud . such claims and other voices of dissent have been silent for some time .
ahmadinejad became the islamic republic 's sixth president last year on aug .
3 ; since then , his words and actions have made his country and the wider world captive audiences . usa : ahmadinejad 's public enemy no.1 with populist outpourings , virulent anti-israeli and anti-american rhetoric and a self-confident and provocative posture in the crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad has created more foreign policy problems for his country in just one year than any of his predecessors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a point of antagonizing bush the target of most of his vitriol is the west and , specifically , the united states : " they accuse our people of violating human rights and freedom .
if god wants it , we will put -lrb- the americans -rrb- before people 's courts .
our people have culture and civilization ; ours are free and revolutionary people . " these people were promised a remedy for the unfulfilled hopes and the underprivileged existence of many of their number after ahmadinejad 's election victory .
the qualified engineer-turned-president , who was only two years before made mayor of tehran , made it easier for the man on the street to get cheap loans , buy homes and also health insurance . however , it soon became clear that on the domestic front , as well as in the international arena , ahmadinejad would be no trouble-free president .
he appointed old companions from his time with the revolutionary guards in ministerial and other posts - some of whom he then had to replace again after embarrassing displays of incompetence - and he began to distinguish himself in the wider world , making enemies and friends in equal measure . a damning appraisal of the un " justice should be of the utmost importance in this organization and according to its charter , all member states should have the same rights , " he told the united nations assembly during his first speech at the un .
" bigger power or bigger wealth should not provide any member with more rights than any other . " his speech set a precedent for bating the un .
as tensions increased over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad resolutely rejected every compromise offered as an unreasonable capitulation .
he then further angered the international community by ostentatiously celebrating iran 's first successful enrichment of uranium . at the same time , ahmadinejad opened a second front by launching scathing attacks on israel , quoting the revolutionary leader ayatollah khomeini by stating the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and adding his own words on holocaust denial . holocaust denial caused outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad favors explosive rhetoric " if the europeans say that they killed 6 million jews in the second world war ; if you have really burned 6 million jews in the ovens … and this seems to be correct because you maintain this over and over again and punish everybody which is of another opinion , you even condemn your scholars who are of another opinion … .so , we ask you : if you have really committed this big crime - why should the suppressed palestinian people be punished for it ? " " if you have committed a crime , you yourselves should pay for it .
our suggestion remains unchanged : if you have committed a crime , it is only right that you make part of your own land available - in europe , the usa , canada or alaska - and establish -lrb- a jewish state -rrb- there .

but the reform plan she 's released has been roundly condemned and even brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets . germany has one of the best health care systems in the world , but experts have said for years that it wo n't stay that way unless it is substantially reformed .
the system faces a massive budget shortfall , largely due to a financing structure that no longer works in today 's germany due to rising costs , low birth rates and stubbornly high unemployment . a reform plan hammered out by merkel 's coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and conservative christian democrats was released last month to the public and immediately was subjected to scathing criticism by everyone from health care providers , unions and analysts to business leaders and even parts of merkel 's own government . it brought health care employees onto the streets , protesting at what they fear will be huge job losses , and sparked a highly visible feud between the heads of public health insurance companies and german health minister ulla schmidt , who has threatened to use legal means to punish those companies if they use patients ' health care contributions to fund a campaign critical of the government 's plan . the whole thing has left most members of the public shaking their heads , unsure of what the changes mean or if the high-quality health care to which they 've become accustomed is terminally ill . the problem germany 's health care system consists of 252 public health insurance companies , which cover almost 90 percent of the population , about 73 million people .
the other 10 percent – mostly high earners and the self-employed - are covered by private insurance plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no magic pill to make it all better , unfortunately the system is funded by contributions from employers and employees , who pay just under 14 percent of their salaries into it .
still , next year , there will be an expected shortfall of 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " there have to be difference sources of revenue .
we 've basically said the financing basis has to be broadened , " said barbara marnach , deputy spokesman of the aok public health plan , one of germany 's largest , which began lobbying hard as politicians took up the health care reform issue seriously in the spring . july saw the end of months of haggling over how to fill up quickly draining health care coffers , and several competing plans were put forward .
there was talk of introducing a flat health insurance fee , doing away with private plans to bring the well-off – and their money - back into the public fold , raising taxes or increasing employee contribution rates . everyone agreed something had to be done ; no one could agree what that something was .
all the proposals were potential political minefields . the proposed solution instead of raising taxes , which proved politically impossible due to an already scheduled increase in value-added tax in 2007 , the reform plan will ask that employer / employee contributions be increased by 0.5 percent next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will have to start paying for more services that were once covered by basic plans a new " health fund " will be introduced in 2008 into which those contributions will be paid , sweetened with some tax revenues -lrb- 1.5 billion euros in 2008 -rrb- from the federal government , mainly to cover health insurance for children .
the fund will pay out a flat fee , set by the government , for every insured person to the public insurance companies .
previously , individual health plans have collected workers ' contributions on their own . merkel called it a " breakthrough " and health minister schmidt has said it will reduce bureaucracy , boost competition and cut cost in a system which swallows around 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 179 billion -rrb- a year and employs 4.2 million people . the uproar but others are calling it by different names - " wasteful " , for example , saying the plan does little to cure the system 's ailments in the long term .
instead of cutting bureaucracy , it creates a whole new one , said aok 's marnach . " and that means now new organizations and procedures will have to be created , which brings with it more costs , " she said .
" the simple question is , what good is it going to do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's little love lost these days between health minister ulla schmidt and health insurance companies public insurers argue the reform plan runs counter to the goals set out by the government , since it will put more power in the government 's hands and give public insurance companies less ability to compete . " we have n't gotten more authority to act on the free market , rather this reform leads to further socialization .
it will simply be less efficient , " said marnach . some say the proposed reforms are a decent start , given the monumental nature of the task , although they are few .
sophia schlette , head of health care policy for the bertelsmann foundation , says the fears of creating a lumbering new bureaucracy are overblown . " the countries that do better when it comes to costs and various health care indicators are interestingly enough those country that have what here is being described as the horror scenario of the single health fund system , " she told german public radio . it also has some of those four million health insurance company employees worried about their jobs .
last week , 21,000 of them took to the streets in five cities demanding that the government rethink its reform plan , which according to marnach , could lead to a loss of some 25,000 jobs . if not this reform , which ? the reform plan 's vocal critics claim they are not just complaining about change and fully agree that reform is needed - just not this jumble of reforms that no one , not even members of the coalition government , seem particularly happy about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say political realities of germany 's left-right coalition goverment are standing in the way of real reform competing interests and political moves to keep the governing coalition from collapsing in a health care fight are both to blame for the watered-down compromise that was put forward , according to herbert weisbrod-frey , head of the health care policy department at the ver.di service union .

parrots are practically the new chihuahuas .
dw-world.de - your fashion-conscious news source - is heading the trend in bringing you the latest and juiciest bits from the fascinating world of name-dropping birds . as an animal , you ca n't go any higher in the fashion world than becoming a must-have accessory of the cutting-edge tokyo teenage fashion mafia .
parrots are yet to achieve the cult status of the taco bell dog , but - judging by the recent media coverage - they seem to have taken their first steps on the way to stardom . hats off to parrots .
for centuries , they 've been stuck with a single , utterly demeaning and confidence-crushing role of a pirate 's sidekick .
year after year , generation after generation , they 've been hanging out exclusively with men who call themselves captain randal chumbucket , no-eyes herb or jelly-legs wade ; the seafaring demimonde whose fashion accoutrement consists of a peg leg , an eye patch and a hook ; and pre-metrosexual creatures who never shave or bathe , let alone condition or exfoliate . but those days are over .
all of a sudden , parrots are all the rage . " i wanna hold you and hug you and call you george " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , no language lab will be complete without a course in parrot phonology only days after a parrot in the german city of koblenz earned his celebrity status by almost getting its owner arrested when one elderly lady mistook its voice for that of a neglected child - yelling " mother !
mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time . " the birds definitely use a particular call exclusively with a particular bird and never for any other birds , " says rolf wanker , head of the hamburg university zoological institute 's behavioral research lab . " what is not yet clear , however , is whether these calls can be equated with what we would call names such as hans or fritz or whether they could be more generic labels such as ' my baby ' or ' my mate , " ' wanker said . a rose by any other name … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star chef jamie " fresh herbs " oliver is also creative when it comes to children 's names first of all , if parrots were giving conventional names to their children , one would certainly hope that they would be a little more inventive than hans or fritz .
no respectable avian wants to call their children hans or fritz .
if they did , they would be the laughing stock of the entire tropical forest . judging by their fabulous , flashy attire , parrots would probably go for something more exotic and glamorous - like all celebrities do .
just ask dweezle -lrb- zappa -rrb- , fifi-trixibelle -lrb- geldof -rrb- , jermajesty -lrb- jackson -rrb- or daisy boo -lrb- oliver -rrb- . and if they had to chose a german name , they would - in order to raise the community intellectual bar a notch higher - probably do it in the fashion of tommy lee jones by calling the parrot chick something along the lines of kafka lee jones . what are they talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parrots are slowly breaking out of the shackles of history secondly , if parrots are using generic labels , we ca n't be too sure that they are actually using affectionate platitudes such as " honey " or " sweetie . "
for all we know , they could be hurling profanities at each other , telling their kids to shut up for once or uttering cries of parental despair -lrb- " shive me timbers ! " -rrb-
centuries of piracy must have left some kind of cultural trace on the species . other studies have shown that birds develop regional " accents " and " dialects " as well .
in the united states , sparrows on the east coast can laugh for days when one of the local clowns starts imitating their distant cousins from the south . the discovery by german scientists remains , nonetheless , a fascinating one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the wagner festival in bayreuth drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth " germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy " bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.08.2006 schlingensief 's " parsifal " deepens divide at wagner festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religious symbols abound in schlingensief 's " parsifal " christoph schlingensief 's controversial rendition of " parsifal " concluded the first round of the program at the wagner festival wednesday in what may be the most daring production to come from bayreuth . after monday 's conclusion to the first complete performance of the ring cycle on bayreuth 's " green hill " brought mixed reviews , christoph schlingensief 's controversial production of parsifal deepened the divide wednesday . the 45-year-old german director was met with boos , but also applause when he appeared on stage after the performance .
his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .
he presented kundry -lrb- evelyn herlitzius -rrb- , a helper to the knight searching for the holy grail , as a fundamentalist islamic fighter clad in black . " it may be a lot to expect of the people in the expensive seats , " the avant-garde producer said about his first opera in an interview with german news agency dpa thursday , " but i have reconciled nietzsche with wagner by negating wagner 's silly buddhist dream . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alfons eberz is parsifal , left , and robert holl is gurnemanz a biography of the producer that appears on his personal web site describes him as " a moralist with messages of an almost biblical tone " who " creates a permanent state of insecurity by blurring borders between reality and fiction , art and offense , intention and action . " in the interview , schlingensief added that , despite any controversy and " insecurity " that may have arisen , the festival heads had given his production " a high artistic rating , " which " would n't have been possible after the premiere in 2004 . "
then again , he has thoroughly reworked the opera since then . parsifal was the self-proclaimed wagner fan 's first opera production .
he said he now finds opera more exciting than theater and does n't exclude the possibility of returning to bayreuth for another project in the future . once again , applause for musical excellence hungarian-born conductor adam fischer , who conducted the ring in bayreuth from 2001 to 2004 , was praised by critics for a " precise , " even " consecrated " performance , though he may have " lacked tension " at times . as in the ring , both the conductor and the singers came away with high marks .
only the two producers - schlingensief and tankred dorst - have ruffled feathers and polarized critics . wagner 's parsifal is loosely based on wolfram von eschenbach 's middle high german epic parzival .
the work by the 12th century poet , probably inspired by chrétien de troyes ' perceval in french , is the first known german composition to thematicize the holy grail . it is speculated that wagner created a word play by changing the spelling of the epic : " parsi " is similar to the persian word for " persian " and " fal " is close to the german and english word " fall , " thus alluding to a " fall of the persians . " competition strategies for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief made a few revisions since the 2004 version shown here this parsifal rendition is certainly the most unusual production ever to be performed in bayreuth , wrote news agency dpa thursday .
other opera companies also perform wagner and , in spite of the advantage of having a long tradition , the bayreuth festival has to remain competitive . shortened runtimes for new productions should also add to the festival 's competitive edge by allowing for a greater sense of novelty in the program .
parsifal will be remade in 2008 , but it is unclear who will be entrusted with the production . the next fresh addition to look forward to is katharina wagner 's production of the mastersingers of nuremberg , planned to premiere in 2007 .
she is the daughter of the current festival director , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , and richard wagner 's great-granddaughter .
katharina 's bayreuth debut will be closely observed , as she is likely to succeed her father in running the festival . wednesday 's performance of parsifal concluded the first round of operas at this year 's wagner festival .
the ring , the flying dutchman , tristan and isolde and parsifal will be repeated in a total of 22 more performances until the festival ends on august 28 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth the first " ring " cycle concluded monday to mixed reviews and a polarized audience .

but the reform plan she 's released has been roundly condemned and even brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets . germany has one of the best health care systems in the world , but experts have said for years that it wo n't stay that way unless it is substantially reformed .
the system faces a massive budget shortfall , largely due to a financing structure that no longer works in today 's germany due to rising costs , low birth rates and stubbornly high unemployment . a reform plan hammered out by merkel 's coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and conservative christian democrats was released last month to the public and immediately was subjected to scathing criticism by everyone from health care providers , unions and analysts to business leaders and even parts of merkel 's own government . it brought health care employees onto the streets , protesting at what they fear will be huge job losses , and sparked a highly visible feud between the heads of public health insurance companies and german health minister ulla schmidt , who has threatened to use legal means to punish those companies if they use patients ' health care contributions to fund a campaign critical of the government 's plan . the whole thing has left most members of the public shaking their heads , unsure of what the changes mean or if the high-quality health care to which they 've become accustomed is terminally ill . the problem germany 's health care system consists of 252 public health insurance companies , which cover almost 90 percent of the population , about 73 million people .
the other 10 percent – mostly high earners and the self-employed - are covered by private insurance plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no magic pill to make it all better , unfortunately the system is funded by contributions from employers and employees , who pay just under 14 percent of their salaries into it .
still , next year , there will be an expected shortfall of 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " there have to be difference sources of revenue .
we 've basically said the financing basis has to be broadened , " said barbara marnach , deputy spokesman of the aok public health plan , one of germany 's largest , which began lobbying hard as politicians took up the health care reform issue seriously in the spring . july saw the end of months of haggling over how to fill up quickly draining health care coffers , and several competing plans were put forward .
there was talk of introducing a flat health insurance fee , doing away with private plans to bring the well-off – and their money - back into the public fold , raising taxes or increasing employee contribution rates . everyone agreed something had to be done ; no one could agree what that something was .
all the proposals were potential political minefields . the proposed solution instead of raising taxes , which proved politically impossible due to an already scheduled increase in value-added tax in 2007 , the reform plan will ask that employer / employee contributions be increased by 0.5 percent next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will have to start paying for more services that were once covered by basic plans a new " health fund " will be introduced in 2008 into which those contributions will be paid , sweetened with some tax revenues -lrb- 1.5 billion euros in 2008 -rrb- from the federal government , mainly to cover health insurance for children .
the fund will pay out a flat fee , set by the government , for every insured person to the public insurance companies .
previously , individual health plans have collected workers ' contributions on their own . merkel called it a " breakthrough " and health minister schmidt has said it will reduce bureaucracy , boost competition and cut cost in a system which swallows around 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 179 billion -rrb- a year and employs 4.2 million people . the uproar but others are calling it by different names - " wasteful " , for example , saying the plan does little to cure the system 's ailments in the long term .
instead of cutting bureaucracy , it creates a whole new one , said aok 's marnach . " and that means now new organizations and procedures will have to be created , which brings with it more costs , " she said .
" the simple question is , what good is it going to do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's little love lost these days between health minister ulla schmidt and health insurance companies public insurers argue the reform plan runs counter to the goals set out by the government , since it will put more power in the government 's hands and give public insurance companies less ability to compete . " we have n't gotten more authority to act on the free market , rather this reform leads to further socialization .
it will simply be less efficient , " said marnach . some say the proposed reforms are a decent start , given the monumental nature of the task , although they are few .
sophia schlette , head of health care policy for the bertelsmann foundation , says the fears of creating a lumbering new bureaucracy are overblown . " the countries that do better when it comes to costs and various health care indicators are interestingly enough those country that have what here is being described as the horror scenario of the single health fund system , " she told german public radio . it also has some of those four million health insurance company employees worried about their jobs .
last week , 21,000 of them took to the streets in five cities demanding that the government rethink its reform plan , which according to marnach , could lead to a loss of some 25,000 jobs . if not this reform , which ? the reform plan 's vocal critics claim they are not just complaining about change and fully agree that reform is needed - just not this jumble of reforms that no one , not even members of the coalition government , seem particularly happy about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say political realities of germany 's left-right coalition goverment are standing in the way of real reform competing interests and political moves to keep the governing coalition from collapsing in a health care fight are both to blame for the watered-down compromise that was put forward , according to herbert weisbrod-frey , head of the health care policy department at the ver.di service union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.08.2006 german health care reform : mission impossible ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german health care system needs some major surgery - it 's not getting it chancellor angela merkel put health care reform at the top of her government 's agenda .
but the reform plan she 's released has been roundly condemned and even brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets . germany has one of the best health care systems in the world , but experts have said for years that it wo n't stay that way unless it is substantially reformed .
the system faces a massive budget shortfall , largely due to a financing structure that no longer works in today 's germany due to rising costs , low birth rates and stubbornly high unemployment . a reform plan hammered out by merkel 's coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and conservative christian democrats was released last month to the public and immediately was subjected to scathing criticism by everyone from health care providers , unions and analysts to business leaders and even parts of merkel 's own government . it brought health care employees onto the streets , protesting at what they fear will be huge job losses , and sparked a highly visible feud between the heads of public health insurance companies and german health minister ulla schmidt , who has threatened to use legal means to punish those companies if they use patients ' health care contributions to fund a campaign critical of the government 's plan . the whole thing has left most members of the public shaking their heads , unsure of what the changes mean or if the high-quality health care to which they 've become accustomed is terminally ill . the problem germany 's health care system consists of 252 public health insurance companies , which cover almost 90 percent of the population , about 73 million people .
the other 10 percent – mostly high earners and the self-employed - are covered by private insurance plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no magic pill to make it all better , unfortunately the system is funded by contributions from employers and employees , who pay just under 14 percent of their salaries into it .
still , next year , there will be an expected shortfall of 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " there have to be difference sources of revenue .
we 've basically said the financing basis has to be broadened , " said barbara marnach , deputy spokesman of the aok public health plan , one of germany 's largest , which began lobbying hard as politicians took up the health care reform issue seriously in the spring . july saw the end of months of haggling over how to fill up quickly draining health care coffers , and several competing plans were put forward .
there was talk of introducing a flat health insurance fee , doing away with private plans to bring the well-off – and their money - back into the public fold , raising taxes or increasing employee contribution rates . everyone agreed something had to be done ; no one could agree what that something was .
all the proposals were potential political minefields . the proposed solution instead of raising taxes , which proved politically impossible due to an already scheduled increase in value-added tax in 2007 , the reform plan will ask that employer / employee contributions be increased by 0.5 percent next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will have to start paying for more services that were once covered by basic plans a new " health fund " will be introduced in 2008 into which those contributions will be paid , sweetened with some tax revenues -lrb- 1.5 billion euros in 2008 -rrb- from the federal government , mainly to cover health insurance for children .
the fund will pay out a flat fee , set by the government , for every insured person to the public insurance companies .
previously , individual health plans have collected workers ' contributions on their own . merkel called it a " breakthrough " and health minister schmidt has said it will reduce bureaucracy , boost competition and cut cost in a system which swallows around 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 179 billion -rrb- a year and employs 4.2 million people . the uproar but others are calling it by different names - " wasteful " , for example , saying the plan does little to cure the system 's ailments in the long term .
instead of cutting bureaucracy , it creates a whole new one , said aok 's marnach . " and that means now new organizations and procedures will have to be created , which brings with it more costs , " she said .
" the simple question is , what good is it going to do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's little love lost these days between health minister ulla schmidt and health insurance companies public insurers argue the reform plan runs counter to the goals set out by the government , since it will put more power in the government 's hands and give public insurance companies less ability to compete . " we have n't gotten more authority to act on the free market , rather this reform leads to further socialization .
it will simply be less efficient , " said marnach . some say the proposed reforms are a decent start , given the monumental nature of the task , although they are few .
sophia schlette , head of health care policy for the bertelsmann foundation , says the fears of creating a lumbering new bureaucracy are overblown . " the countries that do better when it comes to costs and various health care indicators are interestingly enough those country that have what here is being described as the horror scenario of the single health fund system , " she told german public radio . it also has some of those four million health insurance company employees worried about their jobs .
last week , 21,000 of them took to the streets in five cities demanding that the government rethink its reform plan , which according to marnach , could lead to a loss of some 25,000 jobs . if not this reform , which ? the reform plan 's vocal critics claim they are not just complaining about change and fully agree that reform is needed - just not this jumble of reforms that no one , not even members of the coalition government , seem particularly happy about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say political realities of germany 's left-right coalition goverment are standing in the way of real reform competing interests and political moves to keep the governing coalition from collapsing in a health care fight are both to blame for the watered-down compromise that was put forward , according to herbert weisbrod-frey , head of the health care policy department at the ver.di service union .

one year on , deutsche welle 's peter philipp looks back on ahmadinejad 's impact on his country and on the wider international community . " even if our ministry of finance , our bank accounts and our households should be empty one day , as god is my witness , ahmadinejad and his government are ready to come here and work with their hands to build up lorestan .
we would be proud to do it . " it was another example of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's skill at gathering the population to him and whipping them into a frenzy of support with populist rhetoric .
speaking at a rally in the province of lorestan in march , ahmadinejad showed again how easy it was to get the iranian people on side - by showing that he was one of them . his simple lifestyle and his ability to distance himself from the corruption that has dogged many other politicians in his country adds credibility to his " man of the people " approach and sets him apart from his predecessors . these qualities and this approach were the primary forces behind ahmadinejad 's election victory on june 25 , 2005 .
in only the second round of the ballot , ahmadinejad secured 61 percent of the vote to end the challenges of the favorite ali akbar rafsanjani , leading to former parliamentary leader mehdi karroubi accusing the newly anointed president of electoral fraud . such claims and other voices of dissent have been silent for some time .
ahmadinejad became the islamic republic 's sixth president last year on aug .
3 ; since then , his words and actions have made his country and the wider world captive audiences . usa : ahmadinejad 's public enemy no.1 with populist outpourings , virulent anti-israeli and anti-american rhetoric and a self-confident and provocative posture in the crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad has created more foreign policy problems for his country in just one year than any of his predecessors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a point of antagonizing bush the target of most of his vitriol is the west and , specifically , the united states : " they accuse our people of violating human rights and freedom .
if god wants it , we will put -lrb- the americans -rrb- before people 's courts .
our people have culture and civilization ; ours are free and revolutionary people . " these people were promised a remedy for the unfulfilled hopes and the underprivileged existence of many of their number after ahmadinejad 's election victory .
the qualified engineer-turned-president , who was only two years before made mayor of tehran , made it easier for the man on the street to get cheap loans , buy homes and also health insurance . however , it soon became clear that on the domestic front , as well as in the international arena , ahmadinejad would be no trouble-free president .
he appointed old companions from his time with the revolutionary guards in ministerial and other posts - some of whom he then had to replace again after embarrassing displays of incompetence - and he began to distinguish himself in the wider world , making enemies and friends in equal measure . a damning appraisal of the un " justice should be of the utmost importance in this organization and according to its charter , all member states should have the same rights , " he told the united nations assembly during his first speech at the un .
" bigger power or bigger wealth should not provide any member with more rights than any other . " his speech set a precedent for bating the un .
as tensions increased over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad resolutely rejected every compromise offered as an unreasonable capitulation .
he then further angered the international community by ostentatiously celebrating iran 's first successful enrichment of uranium . at the same time , ahmadinejad opened a second front by launching scathing attacks on israel , quoting the revolutionary leader ayatollah khomeini by stating the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and adding his own words on holocaust denial . holocaust denial caused outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad favors explosive rhetoric " if the europeans say that they killed 6 million jews in the second world war ; if you have really burned 6 million jews in the ovens … and this seems to be correct because you maintain this over and over again and punish everybody which is of another opinion , you even condemn your scholars who are of another opinion … .so , we ask you : if you have really committed this big crime - why should the suppressed palestinian people be punished for it ? " " if you have committed a crime , you yourselves should pay for it .
our suggestion remains unchanged : if you have committed a crime , it is only right that you make part of your own land available - in europe , the usa , canada or alaska - and establish -lrb- a jewish state -rrb- there .
you could be assured that the iranian people have nothing against it . " ahmadinejad 's comments caused an international storm of outrage , which gave the iranian president the affirmation he needed to increase his attacks .
he compared the us administration , for example , to genghis khan and then likened israel to hitler 's third reich .
in the muslim world , ahmadinejad scored many points with his provocation , even in arab countries which had a natural distrust of iran but saw he was a man of conviction who was ready to take on the us and israel . stance has further alienated iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attitudes to iran in the west have hardened catastrophically , that loathing and irritation of the west colored the nuclear question and the west 's posture towards iran began to harden . a year after mahmoud ahmadinejad took office ; he has inspired much debate and has acquired mass support in his own country but has consequently painted iran into a corner .
if one is searching for a reason why , the most logical explanation would be that ahmadinejad would like to restore the atmosphere of the early islamic republic .
only in self-imposed isolation can such a theocracy survive on a continuing basis . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian president faces holocaust denial charges in germany a joint team of israeli and german lawyers has filed a criminal indictment against the iranian president in germany , requesting he be tried for holocaust denial .

his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .
he presented kundry -lrb- evelyn herlitzius -rrb- , a helper to the knight searching for the holy grail , as a fundamentalist islamic fighter clad in black . " it may be a lot to expect of the people in the expensive seats , " the avant-garde producer said about his first opera in an interview with german news agency dpa thursday , " but i have reconciled nietzsche with wagner by negating wagner 's silly buddhist dream . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alfons eberz is parsifal , left , and robert holl is gurnemanz a biography of the producer that appears on his personal web site describes him as " a moralist with messages of an almost biblical tone " who " creates a permanent state of insecurity by blurring borders between reality and fiction , art and offense , intention and action . " in the interview , schlingensief added that , despite any controversy and " insecurity " that may have arisen , the festival heads had given his production " a high artistic rating , " which " would n't have been possible after the premiere in 2004 . "
then again , he has thoroughly reworked the opera since then . parsifal was the self-proclaimed wagner fan 's first opera production .
he said he now finds opera more exciting than theater and does n't exclude the possibility of returning to bayreuth for another project in the future . once again , applause for musical excellence hungarian-born conductor adam fischer , who conducted the ring in bayreuth from 2001 to 2004 , was praised by critics for a " precise , " even " consecrated " performance , though he may have " lacked tension " at times . as in the ring , both the conductor and the singers came away with high marks .
only the two producers - schlingensief and tankred dorst - have ruffled feathers and polarized critics . wagner 's parsifal is loosely based on wolfram von eschenbach 's middle high german epic parzival .
the work by the 12th century poet , probably inspired by chrétien de troyes ' perceval in french , is the first known german composition to thematicize the holy grail . it is speculated that wagner created a word play by changing the spelling of the epic : " parsi " is similar to the persian word for " persian " and " fal " is close to the german and english word " fall , " thus alluding to a " fall of the persians . " competition strategies for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief made a few revisions since the 2004 version shown here this parsifal rendition is certainly the most unusual production ever to be performed in bayreuth , wrote news agency dpa thursday .
other opera companies also perform wagner and , in spite of the advantage of having a long tradition , the bayreuth festival has to remain competitive . shortened runtimes for new productions should also add to the festival 's competitive edge by allowing for a greater sense of novelty in the program .
parsifal will be remade in 2008 , but it is unclear who will be entrusted with the production . the next fresh addition to look forward to is katharina wagner 's production of the mastersingers of nuremberg , planned to premiere in 2007 .
she is the daughter of the current festival director , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , and richard wagner 's great-granddaughter .
katharina 's bayreuth debut will be closely observed , as she is likely to succeed her father in running the festival . wednesday 's performance of parsifal concluded the first round of operas at this year 's wagner festival .

his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .
he presented kundry -lrb- evelyn herlitzius -rrb- , a helper to the knight searching for the holy grail , as a fundamentalist islamic fighter clad in black . " it may be a lot to expect of the people in the expensive seats , " the avant-garde producer said about his first opera in an interview with german news agency dpa thursday , " but i have reconciled nietzsche with wagner by negating wagner 's silly buddhist dream . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alfons eberz is parsifal , left , and robert holl is gurnemanz a biography of the producer that appears on his personal web site describes him as " a moralist with messages of an almost biblical tone " who " creates a permanent state of insecurity by blurring borders between reality and fiction , art and offense , intention and action . " in the interview , schlingensief added that , despite any controversy and " insecurity " that may have arisen , the festival heads had given his production " a high artistic rating , " which " would n't have been possible after the premiere in 2004 . "
then again , he has thoroughly reworked the opera since then . parsifal was the self-proclaimed wagner fan 's first opera production .
he said he now finds opera more exciting than theater and does n't exclude the possibility of returning to bayreuth for another project in the future . once again , applause for musical excellence hungarian-born conductor adam fischer , who conducted the ring in bayreuth from 2001 to 2004 , was praised by critics for a " precise , " even " consecrated " performance , though he may have " lacked tension " at times . as in the ring , both the conductor and the singers came away with high marks .
only the two producers - schlingensief and tankred dorst - have ruffled feathers and polarized critics . wagner 's parsifal is loosely based on wolfram von eschenbach 's middle high german epic parzival .
the work by the 12th century poet , probably inspired by chrétien de troyes ' perceval in french , is the first known german composition to thematicize the holy grail . it is speculated that wagner created a word play by changing the spelling of the epic : " parsi " is similar to the persian word for " persian " and " fal " is close to the german and english word " fall , " thus alluding to a " fall of the persians . " competition strategies for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief made a few revisions since the 2004 version shown here this parsifal rendition is certainly the most unusual production ever to be performed in bayreuth , wrote news agency dpa thursday .
other opera companies also perform wagner and , in spite of the advantage of having a long tradition , the bayreuth festival has to remain competitive . shortened runtimes for new productions should also add to the festival 's competitive edge by allowing for a greater sense of novelty in the program .
parsifal will be remade in 2008 , but it is unclear who will be entrusted with the production . the next fresh addition to look forward to is katharina wagner 's production of the mastersingers of nuremberg , planned to premiere in 2007 .
she is the daughter of the current festival director , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , and richard wagner 's great-granddaughter .
katharina 's bayreuth debut will be closely observed , as she is likely to succeed her father in running the festival . wednesday 's performance of parsifal concluded the first round of operas at this year 's wagner festival .

speaking at a rally in the province of lorestan in march , ahmadinejad showed again how easy it was to get the iranian people on side - by showing that he was one of them . his simple lifestyle and his ability to distance himself from the corruption that has dogged many other politicians in his country adds credibility to his " man of the people " approach and sets him apart from his predecessors . these qualities and this approach were the primary forces behind ahmadinejad 's election victory on june 25 , 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.08.2006 european central bank raises rates on inflation fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's gotten more expensive to borrow money in europe the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised the key euro-zone interest rate by a quarter point to 3.0 percent on thursday , making borrowing costs the highest in three-and-a-half years in order to curb inflation . as widely expected , the ecb decided to raise its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to 3.00 percent , the highest level since december 2002 , to counter inflationary high oil prices and accelerating economic growth . less than an hour earlier , the bank of england had also tightened its monetary policy , raising its own key rate for the first time in a year by 0.25 percentage points to 4.75 percent . the ecb 's move is the fourth quarter-point rise in euro-zone borrowing costs since december .
the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .
but this year , the 18-strong board was convening in person at the ecb 's eurotower headquarters in frankfurt , a sure sign that a move in interest rates was on the cards . the meeting was also attended by eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . worries about inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president jean-claude trichet said the rate could go up even further in the future inflationary risks are rising in the 12-country euro zone , primarily as a result of high oil prices , european central bank president jean-claude trichet said on thursday . " the risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented , " the ecb chief told a news conference after the increase was announced . the main risks included " further increases in oil prices , a stronger-than-anticipated pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices , and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , " the frenchman said . he added that euro-zone interest rates are likely to be rise still further . with area-wide growth currently above trend , inflation above target and credit and money supply growth accelerating strongly , the ecb believes higher borrowing costs are necessary to nip inflation the bud . area-wide inflation stood at 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in june , far above the ecb 's ceiling of 2.0 percent , fuelled by runaway energy prices . the bank is concerned that energy price developments may trigger so-called " second-round " effects , with demands for higher wages to compensate for the high price of petrol and heating oil leading to an inflation spiral . as yet , there is no sign of that happening , but the ecb believes that prevention is better than cure . about time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sky-high energy prices have economists worried commerzbank chief economist jörg krämer said the tightening move on thursday was " long overdue " . " the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum . " in recent months , economic activity in the euro area , and in germany in particular , has increasingly gained strength , " glos said in a short statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers find world cup triggers stock market response like many a soccer ball in germany right now , the german stock market has been bouncing up and down and round this week .

parrots are practically the new chihuahuas .
dw-world.de - your fashion-conscious news source - is heading the trend in bringing you the latest and juiciest bits from the fascinating world of name-dropping birds . as an animal , you ca n't go any higher in the fashion world than becoming a must-have accessory of the cutting-edge tokyo teenage fashion mafia .
parrots are yet to achieve the cult status of the taco bell dog , but - judging by the recent media coverage - they seem to have taken their first steps on the way to stardom . hats off to parrots .
for centuries , they 've been stuck with a single , utterly demeaning and confidence-crushing role of a pirate 's sidekick .
year after year , generation after generation , they 've been hanging out exclusively with men who call themselves captain randal chumbucket , no-eyes herb or jelly-legs wade ; the seafaring demimonde whose fashion accoutrement consists of a peg leg , an eye patch and a hook ; and pre-metrosexual creatures who never shave or bathe , let alone condition or exfoliate . but those days are over .
all of a sudden , parrots are all the rage . " i wanna hold you and hug you and call you george " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , no language lab will be complete without a course in parrot phonology only days after a parrot in the german city of koblenz earned his celebrity status by almost getting its owner arrested when one elderly lady mistook its voice for that of a neglected child - yelling " mother !
mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time . " the birds definitely use a particular call exclusively with a particular bird and never for any other birds , " says rolf wanker , head of the hamburg university zoological institute 's behavioral research lab . " what is not yet clear , however , is whether these calls can be equated with what we would call names such as hans or fritz or whether they could be more generic labels such as ' my baby ' or ' my mate , " ' wanker said . a rose by any other name … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star chef jamie " fresh herbs " oliver is also creative when it comes to children 's names first of all , if parrots were giving conventional names to their children , one would certainly hope that they would be a little more inventive than hans or fritz .
no respectable avian wants to call their children hans or fritz .
if they did , they would be the laughing stock of the entire tropical forest . judging by their fabulous , flashy attire , parrots would probably go for something more exotic and glamorous - like all celebrities do .
just ask dweezle -lrb- zappa -rrb- , fifi-trixibelle -lrb- geldof -rrb- , jermajesty -lrb- jackson -rrb- or daisy boo -lrb- oliver -rrb- . and if they had to chose a german name , they would - in order to raise the community intellectual bar a notch higher - probably do it in the fashion of tommy lee jones by calling the parrot chick something along the lines of kafka lee jones . what are they talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parrots are slowly breaking out of the shackles of history secondly , if parrots are using generic labels , we ca n't be too sure that they are actually using affectionate platitudes such as " honey " or " sweetie . "
for all we know , they could be hurling profanities at each other , telling their kids to shut up for once or uttering cries of parental despair -lrb- " shive me timbers ! " -rrb-
centuries of piracy must have left some kind of cultural trace on the species . other studies have shown that birds develop regional " accents " and " dialects " as well .
in the united states , sparrows on the east coast can laugh for days when one of the local clowns starts imitating their distant cousins from the south . the discovery by german scientists remains , nonetheless , a fascinating one .
too bad the elderly lady from koblenz , who called law enforcement because she did n't realize she was eavesdropping on the neighbor 's parrot , did n't know about it . yo-ho-ho .
and a bottle of rum . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mama , can you hear me ?
television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .
this is a story about a neighborhood-watching german lady who also may have watched too much court tv .
-lrb- july 31 , 2006 -rrb- the best of " from the fringe " from expensive , second-hand chewing gum to strange ferrari auctions , from friendly berliners to the other tennis player named b. becker , from exotic " summer hole " stars to wheelchair cons , we 've gathered a selection of our " from the fringe " stories so you 'll always be up to date on the quirkiest news items to come out of germany .
call it like it is despite germany 's restrictive laws on acceptable names for children , quirky ones squeak through .

dw-world.de - your fashion-conscious news source - is heading the trend in bringing you the latest and juiciest bits from the fascinating world of name-dropping birds . as an animal , you ca n't go any higher in the fashion world than becoming a must-have accessory of the cutting-edge tokyo teenage fashion mafia .
parrots are yet to achieve the cult status of the taco bell dog , but - judging by the recent media coverage - they seem to have taken their first steps on the way to stardom . hats off to parrots .
for centuries , they 've been stuck with a single , utterly demeaning and confidence-crushing role of a pirate 's sidekick .
year after year , generation after generation , they 've been hanging out exclusively with men who call themselves captain randal chumbucket , no-eyes herb or jelly-legs wade ; the seafaring demimonde whose fashion accoutrement consists of a peg leg , an eye patch and a hook ; and pre-metrosexual creatures who never shave or bathe , let alone condition or exfoliate . but those days are over .

mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time . " the birds definitely use a particular call exclusively with a particular bird and never for any other birds , " says rolf wanker , head of the hamburg university zoological institute 's behavioral research lab . " what is not yet clear , however , is whether these calls can be equated with what we would call names such as hans or fritz or whether they could be more generic labels such as ' my baby ' or ' my mate , " ' wanker said . a rose by any other name … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star chef jamie " fresh herbs " oliver is also creative when it comes to children 's names first of all , if parrots were giving conventional names to their children , one would certainly hope that they would be a little more inventive than hans or fritz .
no respectable avian wants to call their children hans or fritz .
if they did , they would be the laughing stock of the entire tropical forest . judging by their fabulous , flashy attire , parrots would probably go for something more exotic and glamorous - like all celebrities do .

" the troops should be lead by the french , " primor said in an interview for the german television news program tagesschau on wednesday .
" the french have a real interest in lebanon , but they need support .
and the only support that is valuable to the french is german support . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor the german army is already involved in several international operations today - most notably in kosovo , afghanistan and congo .
but the question of its possible deployment near the israeli border is an extremely sensitive issue in both countries . " i do n't think that the german troops could be stationed on the border between israel and germany because of possible frictions .
but the german army could be helpful in logistical matters and perhaps also help prevent the influx of weapons into northern lebanon from syria . " but in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily to be published on friday , israeli leader ehud olmert said his country would have no problem with german soldiers taking part in peacekeeping operations in southern lebanon . " i would be very happy if germany took part , " he said .
" there is at present no other country that acts more friendly toward israel than germany . " diplomatic indecision the difficulty of assembling such an international peacekeeping force was highlighted when differences between france and the united states forced the united nations to again postpone a planned meeting thursday with potential contributors to the mission . france , which is considered a probable leader of the international force , had refused to attend thursday 's meeting because there was no agreement on a political accord . " france believes that the conditions for the force 's deployment have not been met and so this meeting is premature , " french foreign ministry spokesman denis simonneau said in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council is yet to pass a resolution on the current situation in lebanon diplomats said france had distributed a new draft resolution on the middle east crisis , which was to be discussed at a un security council meeting .

the us , on the other hand , wants to see the forces in place before a political settlement is reached . double standards the un failure to act drew the ire of the muslim nations . " they are perplexed in the face of gross double standards applied by the international community , " said ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , the turkish head of the organization of islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- . prominent members of the 57-nation bloc , including iran as well as allies of the us " war on terror " such as turkey and pakistan , condemned what they called the " relentless israeli aggression " and called for an immediate truce . beirut under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert meanwhile , israeli warplanes thundered over beirut on thursday after a six-day lull in an onslaught that lebanese officials say has killed more than 900 nationals and wounded over 3,000 others over three weeks . fifty israelis have died . israeli premier ehud olmert said his country would pursue its drive against hezbollah guerrillas in south lebanon until an international force of some 15,000 combat-ready troops was deployed there . " there should be overlap in terms of time so that we will pull out and they will come in without a time gap that will allow hezbollah to rebuild their position in the south of lebanon , " he told the times of london . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel pushes deep into lebanon as eu envoy arrives for talks in its deepest incursion since hostilities erupted 22 days ago , the israeli defense force hit hezbollah positions and captured prisoners in lebanon as spain 's foreign minister held crisis talks with officials in beirut .

the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .
but this year , the 18-strong board was convening in person at the ecb 's eurotower headquarters in frankfurt , a sure sign that a move in interest rates was on the cards . the meeting was also attended by eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . worries about inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president jean-claude trichet said the rate could go up even further in the future inflationary risks are rising in the 12-country euro zone , primarily as a result of high oil prices , european central bank president jean-claude trichet said on thursday . " the risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented , " the ecb chief told a news conference after the increase was announced . the main risks included " further increases in oil prices , a stronger-than-anticipated pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices , and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , " the frenchman said . he added that euro-zone interest rates are likely to be rise still further . with area-wide growth currently above trend , inflation above target and credit and money supply growth accelerating strongly , the ecb believes higher borrowing costs are necessary to nip inflation the bud . area-wide inflation stood at 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in june , far above the ecb 's ceiling of 2.0 percent , fuelled by runaway energy prices . the bank is concerned that energy price developments may trigger so-called " second-round " effects , with demands for higher wages to compensate for the high price of petrol and heating oil leading to an inflation spiral . as yet , there is no sign of that happening , but the ecb believes that prevention is better than cure . about time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sky-high energy prices have economists worried commerzbank chief economist jörg krämer said the tightening move on thursday was " long overdue " . " the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum .

the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .
but this year , the 18-strong board was convening in person at the ecb 's eurotower headquarters in frankfurt , a sure sign that a move in interest rates was on the cards . the meeting was also attended by eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . worries about inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president jean-claude trichet said the rate could go up even further in the future inflationary risks are rising in the 12-country euro zone , primarily as a result of high oil prices , european central bank president jean-claude trichet said on thursday . " the risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented , " the ecb chief told a news conference after the increase was announced . the main risks included " further increases in oil prices , a stronger-than-anticipated pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices , and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , " the frenchman said . he added that euro-zone interest rates are likely to be rise still further . with area-wide growth currently above trend , inflation above target and credit and money supply growth accelerating strongly , the ecb believes higher borrowing costs are necessary to nip inflation the bud . area-wide inflation stood at 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in june , far above the ecb 's ceiling of 2.0 percent , fuelled by runaway energy prices . the bank is concerned that energy price developments may trigger so-called " second-round " effects , with demands for higher wages to compensate for the high price of petrol and heating oil leading to an inflation spiral . as yet , there is no sign of that happening , but the ecb believes that prevention is better than cure . about time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sky-high energy prices have economists worried commerzbank chief economist jörg krämer said the tightening move on thursday was " long overdue " . " the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum . " in recent months , economic activity in the euro area , and in germany in particular , has increasingly gained strength , " glos said in a short statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers find world cup triggers stock market response like many a soccer ball in germany right now , the german stock market has been bouncing up and down and round this week .

parrots are practically the new chihuahuas .
dw-world.de - your fashion-conscious news source - is heading the trend in bringing you the latest and juiciest bits from the fascinating world of name-dropping birds . as an animal , you ca n't go any higher in the fashion world than becoming a must-have accessory of the cutting-edge tokyo teenage fashion mafia .
parrots are yet to achieve the cult status of the taco bell dog , but - judging by the recent media coverage - they seem to have taken their first steps on the way to stardom . hats off to parrots .
for centuries , they 've been stuck with a single , utterly demeaning and confidence-crushing role of a pirate 's sidekick .
year after year , generation after generation , they 've been hanging out exclusively with men who call themselves captain randal chumbucket , no-eyes herb or jelly-legs wade ; the seafaring demimonde whose fashion accoutrement consists of a peg leg , an eye patch and a hook ; and pre-metrosexual creatures who never shave or bathe , let alone condition or exfoliate . but those days are over .
all of a sudden , parrots are all the rage . " i wanna hold you and hug you and call you george " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , no language lab will be complete without a course in parrot phonology only days after a parrot in the german city of koblenz earned his celebrity status by almost getting its owner arrested when one elderly lady mistook its voice for that of a neglected child - yelling " mother !
mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time . " the birds definitely use a particular call exclusively with a particular bird and never for any other birds , " says rolf wanker , head of the hamburg university zoological institute 's behavioral research lab . " what is not yet clear , however , is whether these calls can be equated with what we would call names such as hans or fritz or whether they could be more generic labels such as ' my baby ' or ' my mate , " ' wanker said . a rose by any other name … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star chef jamie " fresh herbs " oliver is also creative when it comes to children 's names first of all , if parrots were giving conventional names to their children , one would certainly hope that they would be a little more inventive than hans or fritz .
no respectable avian wants to call their children hans or fritz .
if they did , they would be the laughing stock of the entire tropical forest . judging by their fabulous , flashy attire , parrots would probably go for something more exotic and glamorous - like all celebrities do .
just ask dweezle -lrb- zappa -rrb- , fifi-trixibelle -lrb- geldof -rrb- , jermajesty -lrb- jackson -rrb- or daisy boo -lrb- oliver -rrb- . and if they had to chose a german name , they would - in order to raise the community intellectual bar a notch higher - probably do it in the fashion of tommy lee jones by calling the parrot chick something along the lines of kafka lee jones . what are they talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parrots are slowly breaking out of the shackles of history secondly , if parrots are using generic labels , we ca n't be too sure that they are actually using affectionate platitudes such as " honey " or " sweetie . "
for all we know , they could be hurling profanities at each other , telling their kids to shut up for once or uttering cries of parental despair -lrb- " shive me timbers ! " -rrb-
centuries of piracy must have left some kind of cultural trace on the species . other studies have shown that birds develop regional " accents " and " dialects " as well .
in the united states , sparrows on the east coast can laugh for days when one of the local clowns starts imitating their distant cousins from the south . the discovery by german scientists remains , nonetheless , a fascinating one .

television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .

the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .
but this year , the 18-strong board was convening in person at the ecb 's eurotower headquarters in frankfurt , a sure sign that a move in interest rates was on the cards . the meeting was also attended by eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . worries about inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president jean-claude trichet said the rate could go up even further in the future inflationary risks are rising in the 12-country euro zone , primarily as a result of high oil prices , european central bank president jean-claude trichet said on thursday . " the risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented , " the ecb chief told a news conference after the increase was announced . the main risks included " further increases in oil prices , a stronger-than-anticipated pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices , and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , " the frenchman said . he added that euro-zone interest rates are likely to be rise still further . with area-wide growth currently above trend , inflation above target and credit and money supply growth accelerating strongly , the ecb believes higher borrowing costs are necessary to nip inflation the bud . area-wide inflation stood at 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in june , far above the ecb 's ceiling of 2.0 percent , fuelled by runaway energy prices . the bank is concerned that energy price developments may trigger so-called " second-round " effects , with demands for higher wages to compensate for the high price of petrol and heating oil leading to an inflation spiral . as yet , there is no sign of that happening , but the ecb believes that prevention is better than cure . about time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sky-high energy prices have economists worried commerzbank chief economist jörg krämer said the tightening move on thursday was " long overdue " . " the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum .

" the troops should be lead by the french , " primor said in an interview for the german television news program tagesschau on wednesday .
" the french have a real interest in lebanon , but they need support .
and the only support that is valuable to the french is german support . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor the german army is already involved in several international operations today - most notably in kosovo , afghanistan and congo .
but the question of its possible deployment near the israeli border is an extremely sensitive issue in both countries . " i do n't think that the german troops could be stationed on the border between israel and germany because of possible frictions .
but the german army could be helpful in logistical matters and perhaps also help prevent the influx of weapons into northern lebanon from syria . " but in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily to be published on friday , israeli leader ehud olmert said his country would have no problem with german soldiers taking part in peacekeeping operations in southern lebanon . " i would be very happy if germany took part , " he said .
" there is at present no other country that acts more friendly toward israel than germany . " diplomatic indecision the difficulty of assembling such an international peacekeeping force was highlighted when differences between france and the united states forced the united nations to again postpone a planned meeting thursday with potential contributors to the mission . france , which is considered a probable leader of the international force , had refused to attend thursday 's meeting because there was no agreement on a political accord . " france believes that the conditions for the force 's deployment have not been met and so this meeting is premature , " french foreign ministry spokesman denis simonneau said in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council is yet to pass a resolution on the current situation in lebanon diplomats said france had distributed a new draft resolution on the middle east crisis , which was to be discussed at a un security council meeting .
it still called for an " immediate cessation of hostilities " but also calls for " full respect " by both sides of the blue line , the marker used by the un to confirm the withdrawal of israeli troops from lebanon in may 2000 after a 22-year occupation . a security council resolution on the conflict has been held up by the issue of whether international peacekeepers should move in before an outline of a political settlement between israel , hezbollah and the lebanese government has been arranged . france , which is a key contributor to the current un interim force in southern lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , insists that a political settlement must be in place to give any international force a proper mandate to police the region .
the us , on the other hand , wants to see the forces in place before a political settlement is reached . double standards the un failure to act drew the ire of the muslim nations . " they are perplexed in the face of gross double standards applied by the international community , " said ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , the turkish head of the organization of islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- . prominent members of the 57-nation bloc , including iran as well as allies of the us " war on terror " such as turkey and pakistan , condemned what they called the " relentless israeli aggression " and called for an immediate truce . beirut under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert meanwhile , israeli warplanes thundered over beirut on thursday after a six-day lull in an onslaught that lebanese officials say has killed more than 900 nationals and wounded over 3,000 others over three weeks . fifty israelis have died . israeli premier ehud olmert said his country would pursue its drive against hezbollah guerrillas in south lebanon until an international force of some 15,000 combat-ready troops was deployed there . " there should be overlap in terms of time so that we will pull out and they will come in without a time gap that will allow hezbollah to rebuild their position in the south of lebanon , " he told the times of london . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel pushes deep into lebanon as eu envoy arrives for talks in its deepest incursion since hostilities erupted 22 days ago , the israeli defense force hit hezbollah positions and captured prisoners in lebanon as spain 's foreign minister held crisis talks with officials in beirut .

the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .
but this year , the 18-strong board was convening in person at the ecb 's eurotower headquarters in frankfurt , a sure sign that a move in interest rates was on the cards . the meeting was also attended by eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . worries about inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president jean-claude trichet said the rate could go up even further in the future inflationary risks are rising in the 12-country euro zone , primarily as a result of high oil prices , european central bank president jean-claude trichet said on thursday . " the risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented , " the ecb chief told a news conference after the increase was announced . the main risks included " further increases in oil prices , a stronger-than-anticipated pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices , and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , " the frenchman said . he added that euro-zone interest rates are likely to be rise still further . with area-wide growth currently above trend , inflation above target and credit and money supply growth accelerating strongly , the ecb believes higher borrowing costs are necessary to nip inflation the bud . area-wide inflation stood at 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in june , far above the ecb 's ceiling of 2.0 percent , fuelled by runaway energy prices . the bank is concerned that energy price developments may trigger so-called " second-round " effects , with demands for higher wages to compensate for the high price of petrol and heating oil leading to an inflation spiral . as yet , there is no sign of that happening , but the ecb believes that prevention is better than cure . about time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sky-high energy prices have economists worried commerzbank chief economist jörg krämer said the tightening move on thursday was " long overdue " . " the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum .

" viktor yushchenko emerged from talks in the early hours of thursday morning to announce that the main obstacles had finally been overcome in negotiations that followed march 's parliamentary elections . " i have decided to put forward the candidacy of viktor yushchenko for the post of prime minister , " yushchenko told journalists . yushchenko said he realized submitting his former rival 's name for nomination could cause a misunderstanding among members of the mass " orange revolution " protests , which were responsible for ousting yanukovych two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko said he understood some would be upset with his decision " i ask people to understand that we have a unique chance about which we talked about on independence square , about which we dreamed every day - to unite both sides of the dniper -lrb- river -rrb- in understanding , " yushchenko said , referring to the kiev square that was the center of the orange revolution mass protests and to the river that bisects ukraine . " we have a good chance to escape the political war and pass to political competition , " yushchenko added . other than accepting yanukovych 's candidacy , yushchenko 's only other viable option would have been to dissolve parliament and hope to win new elections while prolonging the crisis that has gripped ukraine since march . he said a pact agreed with yanukovych 's pro-russian regions party would be signed later thursday and would ensure that the country kept to its current pro-western course .
a politician with close ties to the kremlin and big business , yanukovych shares few of revolution 's reforming ideals . a n e n d to draw n out n egotiatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych is seen as an economic pragmatist without going into the details , the ukrainian president said part of the deal with his rival included written promises that yanukovych would not try to turn around the country 's attempts at market reforms or european integration . " concerning the principles determining ukraine 's domestic and foreign policy , its continuity , we have made a full stop today , " yushchenko said .
" i am sure that there will be no more discussions . " yanukovych 's regions party won the most seats at the elections , picking up support in the pro-russian east of the country and opposing yushchenko 's plans for ukraine to join the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- , but it failed to win an overall majority . there were no immediate comments from regions on how it planned to cooperate with yushchenko nor details on the likely distribution of cabinet seats . tymoshe n ko 's place still up i n the air thursday 's talks had extended beyond a constitutional deadline of 15 days for yushchenko to decide either to approve yanukovych 's candidacy or dissolve parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko said she fears the effects of a pro-russian government yanukovych , a 56-year-old former electrician from ukraine 's industrial east , served as prime minister between 2002 and 2004 but was forced to back down from a presidential bid when hundreds of thousands of people staged peaceful protests against the election result . in the recent negotiations yushchenko 's glamorous " orange revolution " ally , yulia tymoshenko , opposed a return to power by pro-russian forces , saying it would be better to dissolve parliament than " betray " those who came onto the streets . the idea of ukrainian membership of the european union and nato has prompted consternation in moscow , which has long considered ukraine part of its sphere of influence . despite warnings that the crisis could deter much-needed investment , the economy has picked up recently .

" viktor yushchenko emerged from talks in the early hours of thursday morning to announce that the main obstacles had finally been overcome in negotiations that followed march 's parliamentary elections . " i have decided to put forward the candidacy of viktor yushchenko for the post of prime minister , " yushchenko told journalists . yushchenko said he realized submitting his former rival 's name for nomination could cause a misunderstanding among members of the mass " orange revolution " protests , which were responsible for ousting yanukovych two years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko said he understood some would be upset with his decision " i ask people to understand that we have a unique chance about which we talked about on independence square , about which we dreamed every day - to unite both sides of the dniper -lrb- river -rrb- in understanding , " yushchenko said , referring to the kiev square that was the center of the orange revolution mass protests and to the river that bisects ukraine . " we have a good chance to escape the political war and pass to political competition , " yushchenko added . other than accepting yanukovych 's candidacy , yushchenko 's only other viable option would have been to dissolve parliament and hope to win new elections while prolonging the crisis that has gripped ukraine since march . he said a pact agreed with yanukovych 's pro-russian regions party would be signed later thursday and would ensure that the country kept to its current pro-western course .
a politician with close ties to the kremlin and big business , yanukovych shares few of revolution 's reforming ideals . a n e n d to draw n out n egotiatio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych is seen as an economic pragmatist without going into the details , the ukrainian president said part of the deal with his rival included written promises that yanukovych would not try to turn around the country 's attempts at market reforms or european integration . " concerning the principles determining ukraine 's domestic and foreign policy , its continuity , we have made a full stop today , " yushchenko said .
" i am sure that there will be no more discussions . " yanukovych 's regions party won the most seats at the elections , picking up support in the pro-russian east of the country and opposing yushchenko 's plans for ukraine to join the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- , but it failed to win an overall majority . there were no immediate comments from regions on how it planned to cooperate with yushchenko nor details on the likely distribution of cabinet seats . tymoshe n ko 's place still up i n the air thursday 's talks had extended beyond a constitutional deadline of 15 days for yushchenko to decide either to approve yanukovych 's candidacy or dissolve parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko said she fears the effects of a pro-russian government yanukovych , a 56-year-old former electrician from ukraine 's industrial east , served as prime minister between 2002 and 2004 but was forced to back down from a presidential bid when hundreds of thousands of people staged peaceful protests against the election result . in the recent negotiations yushchenko 's glamorous " orange revolution " ally , yulia tymoshenko , opposed a return to power by pro-russian forces , saying it would be better to dissolve parliament than " betray " those who came onto the streets . the idea of ukrainian membership of the european union and nato has prompted consternation in moscow , which has long considered ukraine part of its sphere of influence . despite warnings that the crisis could deter much-needed investment , the economy has picked up recently .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.08.2006 european central bank raises rates on inflation fears großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's gotten more expensive to borrow money in europe the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised the key euro-zone interest rate by a quarter point to 3.0 percent on thursday , making borrowing costs the highest in three-and-a-half years in order to curb inflation . as widely expected , the ecb decided to raise its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to 3.00 percent , the highest level since december 2002 , to counter inflationary high oil prices and accelerating economic growth . less than an hour earlier , the bank of england had also tightened its monetary policy , raising its own key rate for the first time in a year by 0.25 percentage points to 4.75 percent . the ecb 's move is the fourth quarter-point rise in euro-zone borrowing costs since december .
the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .
but this year , the 18-strong board was convening in person at the ecb 's eurotower headquarters in frankfurt , a sure sign that a move in interest rates was on the cards . the meeting was also attended by eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . worries about inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president jean-claude trichet said the rate could go up even further in the future inflationary risks are rising in the 12-country euro zone , primarily as a result of high oil prices , european central bank president jean-claude trichet said on thursday . " the risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented , " the ecb chief told a news conference after the increase was announced . the main risks included " further increases in oil prices , a stronger-than-anticipated pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices , and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , " the frenchman said . he added that euro-zone interest rates are likely to be rise still further . with area-wide growth currently above trend , inflation above target and credit and money supply growth accelerating strongly , the ecb believes higher borrowing costs are necessary to nip inflation the bud . area-wide inflation stood at 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in june , far above the ecb 's ceiling of 2.0 percent , fuelled by runaway energy prices . the bank is concerned that energy price developments may trigger so-called " second-round " effects , with demands for higher wages to compensate for the high price of petrol and heating oil leading to an inflation spiral . as yet , there is no sign of that happening , but the ecb believes that prevention is better than cure . about time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sky-high energy prices have economists worried commerzbank chief economist jörg krämer said the tightening move on thursday was " long overdue " . " the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum . " in recent months , economic activity in the euro area , and in germany in particular , has increasingly gained strength , " glos said in a short statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers find world cup triggers stock market response like many a soccer ball in germany right now , the german stock market has been bouncing up and down and round this week .

" no country denies iran 's right , " he said during the discussions in tehran , adding that only confidence-building measures were required to make a difference in the disintegrating relationship between iran and the west . " if such confidence-building is realized , great advantages either in terms of peaceful use of nuclear energy or in other political and economic domains would be provided for iran , " fischer added . ira n should help build co n fide n ce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer with iran 's former negotiator hossein mousavian " if iran cooperates in confidence-building matters - as the un security council and the international atomic energy agency have requested - europe and all permanent members of the un security council would be ready to support iran 's right to peaceful use of nuclear energy . " " if iran cooperates with the international community , it will be the big winner , " he said " europe has accepted iran 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and respects the right , but iran 's hasty construction of heavy water reactor in arak and enrichment of uranium up to the level of 3.5 percent have worried europe . " fischer told the assembled academics and diplomats at the meeting that the west feared that an iran armed with nuclear weapons might prompt other regional states to enter into a race to acquire nuclear arms .
he warned that , as a result , the region could turn into a warehouse of nuclear weapons , which would be extremely detrimental to peace , stability and security in the middle east region . weapo n s fear must be removed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has been stepping up missile tests this year " relieving such a concern would be in favor of iran-europe relations , " he said .
" europe is ready to use all its capacity to support iran 's peaceful nuclear technology and cooperate with the country . " fischer explained that iran was facing an important moment in its history .
it could choose to take on a large and outstanding role in the middle east and the world , and assume a leading role in protecting peace , stability and security in the region , or choose to be a detrimental force , complicating and exacerbating its problems .
the country 's choice , he said , could be influenced by how other nations treat iran . " this is the time for clever diplomacy , " he said .
" in essence this will depend on the united states ' conduct towards iran .
and here there is cause for skepticism . " iran would also have to meet the west halfway to ensure a peaceful resolution to the nuclear stand-off . curre n t ira n sta n ce " clearly n egative " in the interview in thursday 's süddeutsche zeitu n g , fischer said that tehran 's current stance had given him " little cause for optimism " and that " iran 's official announcements on the un resolution are clearly negative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the wagner festival in bayreuth drama and fantasy at bayreuth 's wagner festival debate over subsidies brings drama backstage in bayreuth " germany does n't have a clear cut cultural financing policy " bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.08.2006 schlingensief 's " parsifal " deepens divide at wagner festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : religious symbols abound in schlingensief 's " parsifal " christoph schlingensief 's controversial rendition of " parsifal " concluded the first round of the program at the wagner festival wednesday in what may be the most daring production to come from bayreuth . after monday 's conclusion to the first complete performance of the ring cycle on bayreuth 's " green hill " brought mixed reviews , christoph schlingensief 's controversial production of parsifal deepened the divide wednesday . the 45-year-old german director was met with boos , but also applause when he appeared on stage after the performance .
his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .
he presented kundry -lrb- evelyn herlitzius -rrb- , a helper to the knight searching for the holy grail , as a fundamentalist islamic fighter clad in black . " it may be a lot to expect of the people in the expensive seats , " the avant-garde producer said about his first opera in an interview with german news agency dpa thursday , " but i have reconciled nietzsche with wagner by negating wagner 's silly buddhist dream . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alfons eberz is parsifal , left , and robert holl is gurnemanz a biography of the producer that appears on his personal web site describes him as " a moralist with messages of an almost biblical tone " who " creates a permanent state of insecurity by blurring borders between reality and fiction , art and offense , intention and action . " in the interview , schlingensief added that , despite any controversy and " insecurity " that may have arisen , the festival heads had given his production " a high artistic rating , " which " would n't have been possible after the premiere in 2004 . "
then again , he has thoroughly reworked the opera since then . parsifal was the self-proclaimed wagner fan 's first opera production .
he said he now finds opera more exciting than theater and does n't exclude the possibility of returning to bayreuth for another project in the future . once again , applause for musical excellence hungarian-born conductor adam fischer , who conducted the ring in bayreuth from 2001 to 2004 , was praised by critics for a " precise , " even " consecrated " performance , though he may have " lacked tension " at times . as in the ring , both the conductor and the singers came away with high marks .
only the two producers - schlingensief and tankred dorst - have ruffled feathers and polarized critics . wagner 's parsifal is loosely based on wolfram von eschenbach 's middle high german epic parzival .
the work by the 12th century poet , probably inspired by chrétien de troyes ' perceval in french , is the first known german composition to thematicize the holy grail . it is speculated that wagner created a word play by changing the spelling of the epic : " parsi " is similar to the persian word for " persian " and " fal " is close to the german and english word " fall , " thus alluding to a " fall of the persians . " competition strategies for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief made a few revisions since the 2004 version shown here this parsifal rendition is certainly the most unusual production ever to be performed in bayreuth , wrote news agency dpa thursday .
other opera companies also perform wagner and , in spite of the advantage of having a long tradition , the bayreuth festival has to remain competitive . shortened runtimes for new productions should also add to the festival 's competitive edge by allowing for a greater sense of novelty in the program .
parsifal will be remade in 2008 , but it is unclear who will be entrusted with the production . the next fresh addition to look forward to is katharina wagner 's production of the mastersingers of nuremberg , planned to premiere in 2007 .
she is the daughter of the current festival director , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , and richard wagner 's great-granddaughter .
katharina 's bayreuth debut will be closely observed , as she is likely to succeed her father in running the festival . wednesday 's performance of parsifal concluded the first round of operas at this year 's wagner festival .
the ring , the flying dutchman , tristan and isolde and parsifal will be repeated in a total of 22 more performances until the festival ends on august 28 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth the first " ring " cycle concluded monday to mixed reviews and a polarized audience .

his parsifal rendition premiered at the festival in 2004 and has remained contentious since then . a religious conflict known for politicizing his theatrical works , schlingensief focused on the conflict between christianity and islam with a set rich in religious symbolism .
he presented kundry -lrb- evelyn herlitzius -rrb- , a helper to the knight searching for the holy grail , as a fundamentalist islamic fighter clad in black . " it may be a lot to expect of the people in the expensive seats , " the avant-garde producer said about his first opera in an interview with german news agency dpa thursday , " but i have reconciled nietzsche with wagner by negating wagner 's silly buddhist dream . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alfons eberz is parsifal , left , and robert holl is gurnemanz a biography of the producer that appears on his personal web site describes him as " a moralist with messages of an almost biblical tone " who " creates a permanent state of insecurity by blurring borders between reality and fiction , art and offense , intention and action . " in the interview , schlingensief added that , despite any controversy and " insecurity " that may have arisen , the festival heads had given his production " a high artistic rating , " which " would n't have been possible after the premiere in 2004 . "
then again , he has thoroughly reworked the opera since then . parsifal was the self-proclaimed wagner fan 's first opera production .
he said he now finds opera more exciting than theater and does n't exclude the possibility of returning to bayreuth for another project in the future . once again , applause for musical excellence hungarian-born conductor adam fischer , who conducted the ring in bayreuth from 2001 to 2004 , was praised by critics for a " precise , " even " consecrated " performance , though he may have " lacked tension " at times . as in the ring , both the conductor and the singers came away with high marks .
only the two producers - schlingensief and tankred dorst - have ruffled feathers and polarized critics . wagner 's parsifal is loosely based on wolfram von eschenbach 's middle high german epic parzival .
the work by the 12th century poet , probably inspired by chrétien de troyes ' perceval in french , is the first known german composition to thematicize the holy grail . it is speculated that wagner created a word play by changing the spelling of the epic : " parsi " is similar to the persian word for " persian " and " fal " is close to the german and english word " fall , " thus alluding to a " fall of the persians . " competition strategies for the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief made a few revisions since the 2004 version shown here this parsifal rendition is certainly the most unusual production ever to be performed in bayreuth , wrote news agency dpa thursday .
other opera companies also perform wagner and , in spite of the advantage of having a long tradition , the bayreuth festival has to remain competitive . shortened runtimes for new productions should also add to the festival 's competitive edge by allowing for a greater sense of novelty in the program .
parsifal will be remade in 2008 , but it is unclear who will be entrusted with the production . the next fresh addition to look forward to is katharina wagner 's production of the mastersingers of nuremberg , planned to premiere in 2007 .
she is the daughter of the current festival director , 86-year-old wolfgang wagner , and richard wagner 's great-granddaughter .
katharina 's bayreuth debut will be closely observed , as she is likely to succeed her father in running the festival . wednesday 's performance of parsifal concluded the first round of operas at this year 's wagner festival .
the ring , the flying dutchman , tristan and isolde and parsifal will be repeated in a total of 22 more performances until the festival ends on august 28 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bravos and boos for new " ring " production in bayreuth the first " ring " cycle concluded monday to mixed reviews and a polarized audience .

the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .
but this year , the 18-strong board was convening in person at the ecb 's eurotower headquarters in frankfurt , a sure sign that a move in interest rates was on the cards . the meeting was also attended by eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . worries about inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president jean-claude trichet said the rate could go up even further in the future inflationary risks are rising in the 12-country euro zone , primarily as a result of high oil prices , european central bank president jean-claude trichet said on thursday . " the risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented , " the ecb chief told a news conference after the increase was announced . the main risks included " further increases in oil prices , a stronger-than-anticipated pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices , and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , " the frenchman said . he added that euro-zone interest rates are likely to be rise still further . with area-wide growth currently above trend , inflation above target and credit and money supply growth accelerating strongly , the ecb believes higher borrowing costs are necessary to nip inflation the bud . area-wide inflation stood at 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in june , far above the ecb 's ceiling of 2.0 percent , fuelled by runaway energy prices . the bank is concerned that energy price developments may trigger so-called " second-round " effects , with demands for higher wages to compensate for the high price of petrol and heating oil leading to an inflation spiral . as yet , there is no sign of that happening , but the ecb believes that prevention is better than cure . about time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sky-high energy prices have economists worried commerzbank chief economist jörg krämer said the tightening move on thursday was " long overdue " . " the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum .

parrots are practically the new chihuahuas .
dw-world.de - your fashion-conscious news source - is heading the trend in bringing you the latest and juiciest bits from the fascinating world of name-dropping birds . as an animal , you ca n't go any higher in the fashion world than becoming a must-have accessory of the cutting-edge tokyo teenage fashion mafia .
parrots are yet to achieve the cult status of the taco bell dog , but - judging by the recent media coverage - they seem to have taken their first steps on the way to stardom . hats off to parrots .
for centuries , they 've been stuck with a single , utterly demeaning and confidence-crushing role of a pirate 's sidekick .
year after year , generation after generation , they 've been hanging out exclusively with men who call themselves captain randal chumbucket , no-eyes herb or jelly-legs wade ; the seafaring demimonde whose fashion accoutrement consists of a peg leg , an eye patch and a hook ; and pre-metrosexual creatures who never shave or bathe , let alone condition or exfoliate . but those days are over .
all of a sudden , parrots are all the rage . " i wanna hold you and hug you and call you george " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , no language lab will be complete without a course in parrot phonology only days after a parrot in the german city of koblenz earned his celebrity status by almost getting its owner arrested when one elderly lady mistook its voice for that of a neglected child - yelling " mother !
mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time . " the birds definitely use a particular call exclusively with a particular bird and never for any other birds , " says rolf wanker , head of the hamburg university zoological institute 's behavioral research lab . " what is not yet clear , however , is whether these calls can be equated with what we would call names such as hans or fritz or whether they could be more generic labels such as ' my baby ' or ' my mate , " ' wanker said . a rose by any other name … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star chef jamie " fresh herbs " oliver is also creative when it comes to children 's names first of all , if parrots were giving conventional names to their children , one would certainly hope that they would be a little more inventive than hans or fritz .
no respectable avian wants to call their children hans or fritz .
if they did , they would be the laughing stock of the entire tropical forest . judging by their fabulous , flashy attire , parrots would probably go for something more exotic and glamorous - like all celebrities do .
just ask dweezle -lrb- zappa -rrb- , fifi-trixibelle -lrb- geldof -rrb- , jermajesty -lrb- jackson -rrb- or daisy boo -lrb- oliver -rrb- . and if they had to chose a german name , they would - in order to raise the community intellectual bar a notch higher - probably do it in the fashion of tommy lee jones by calling the parrot chick something along the lines of kafka lee jones . what are they talking about ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parrots are slowly breaking out of the shackles of history secondly , if parrots are using generic labels , we ca n't be too sure that they are actually using affectionate platitudes such as " honey " or " sweetie . "
for all we know , they could be hurling profanities at each other , telling their kids to shut up for once or uttering cries of parental despair -lrb- " shive me timbers ! " -rrb-
centuries of piracy must have left some kind of cultural trace on the species . other studies have shown that birds develop regional " accents " and " dialects " as well .
in the united states , sparrows on the east coast can laugh for days when one of the local clowns starts imitating their distant cousins from the south . the discovery by german scientists remains , nonetheless , a fascinating one .
too bad the elderly lady from koblenz , who called law enforcement because she did n't realize she was eavesdropping on the neighbor 's parrot , did n't know about it . yo-ho-ho .
and a bottle of rum . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mama , can you hear me ?
television is bad for you , not because it dumbs you down , but because it makes you too clever for your own good .
this is a story about a neighborhood-watching german lady who also may have watched too much court tv .

parrots are practically the new chihuahuas .
dw-world.de - your fashion-conscious news source - is heading the trend in bringing you the latest and juiciest bits from the fascinating world of name-dropping birds . as an animal , you ca n't go any higher in the fashion world than becoming a must-have accessory of the cutting-edge tokyo teenage fashion mafia .
parrots are yet to achieve the cult status of the taco bell dog , but - judging by the recent media coverage - they seem to have taken their first steps on the way to stardom . hats off to parrots .
for centuries , they 've been stuck with a single , utterly demeaning and confidence-crushing role of a pirate 's sidekick .
year after year , generation after generation , they 've been hanging out exclusively with men who call themselves captain randal chumbucket , no-eyes herb or jelly-legs wade ; the seafaring demimonde whose fashion accoutrement consists of a peg leg , an eye patch and a hook ; and pre-metrosexual creatures who never shave or bathe , let alone condition or exfoliate . but those days are over .

" i wanna hold you and hug you and call you george " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , no language lab will be complete without a course in parrot phonology only days after a parrot in the german city of koblenz earned his celebrity status by almost getting its owner arrested when one elderly lady mistook its voice for that of a neglected child - yelling " mother !
mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time . " the birds definitely use a particular call exclusively with a particular bird and never for any other birds , " says rolf wanker , head of the hamburg university zoological institute 's behavioral research lab . " what is not yet clear , however , is whether these calls can be equated with what we would call names such as hans or fritz or whether they could be more generic labels such as ' my baby ' or ' my mate , " ' wanker said . a rose by any other name … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star chef jamie " fresh herbs " oliver is also creative when it comes to children 's names first of all , if parrots were giving conventional names to their children , one would certainly hope that they would be a little more inventive than hans or fritz .
no respectable avian wants to call their children hans or fritz .
if they did , they would be the laughing stock of the entire tropical forest . judging by their fabulous , flashy attire , parrots would probably go for something more exotic and glamorous - like all celebrities do .

"
for all we know , they could be hurling profanities at each other , telling their kids to shut up for once or uttering cries of parental despair -lrb- " shive me timbers ! " -rrb-
centuries of piracy must have left some kind of cultural trace on the species . other studies have shown that birds develop regional " accents " and " dialects " as well .
in the united states , sparrows on the east coast can laugh for days when one of the local clowns starts imitating their distant cousins from the south . the discovery by german scientists remains , nonetheless , a fascinating one .

parrots are practically the new chihuahuas .
dw-world.de - your fashion-conscious news source - is heading the trend in bringing you the latest and juiciest bits from the fascinating world of name-dropping birds . as an animal , you ca n't go any higher in the fashion world than becoming a must-have accessory of the cutting-edge tokyo teenage fashion mafia .
parrots are yet to achieve the cult status of the taco bell dog , but - judging by the recent media coverage - they seem to have taken their first steps on the way to stardom . hats off to parrots .
for centuries , they 've been stuck with a single , utterly demeaning and confidence-crushing role of a pirate 's sidekick .
year after year , generation after generation , they 've been hanging out exclusively with men who call themselves captain randal chumbucket , no-eyes herb or jelly-legs wade ; the seafaring demimonde whose fashion accoutrement consists of a peg leg , an eye patch and a hook ; and pre-metrosexual creatures who never shave or bathe , let alone condition or exfoliate . but those days are over .
all of a sudden , parrots are all the rage . " i wanna hold you and hug you and call you george " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , no language lab will be complete without a course in parrot phonology only days after a parrot in the german city of koblenz earned his celebrity status by almost getting its owner arrested when one elderly lady mistook its voice for that of a neglected child - yelling " mother !
mother ! " - parrots are in the news again . german behavioral scientists have discovered that parrots address their children with distinct squeaks or " names , " if you will .
not only does the mother bird appear to have the uncanny ability to call a particular child , but the individual parrot chicks also seem to know when they are being addressed and respond accordingly - despite the natural cacophony of their surroundings .
it is , namely , perfectly acceptable in the parrot world for several interlocutors to speak at the same time . " the birds definitely use a particular call exclusively with a particular bird and never for any other birds , " says rolf wanker , head of the hamburg university zoological institute 's behavioral research lab . " what is not yet clear , however , is whether these calls can be equated with what we would call names such as hans or fritz or whether they could be more generic labels such as ' my baby ' or ' my mate , " ' wanker said . a rose by any other name … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : star chef jamie " fresh herbs " oliver is also creative when it comes to children 's names first of all , if parrots were giving conventional names to their children , one would certainly hope that they would be a little more inventive than hans or fritz .

" the troops should be lead by the french , " primor said in an interview for the german television news program tagesschau on wednesday .
" the french have a real interest in lebanon , but they need support .
and the only support that is valuable to the french is german support . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor the german army is already involved in several international operations today - most notably in kosovo , afghanistan and congo .
but the question of its possible deployment near the israeli border is an extremely sensitive issue in both countries . " i do n't think that the german troops could be stationed on the border between israel and germany because of possible frictions .
but the german army could be helpful in logistical matters and perhaps also help prevent the influx of weapons into northern lebanon from syria . " but in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily to be published on friday , israeli leader ehud olmert said his country would have no problem with german soldiers taking part in peacekeeping operations in southern lebanon . " i would be very happy if germany took part , " he said .
" there is at present no other country that acts more friendly toward israel than germany . " diplomatic indecision the difficulty of assembling such an international peacekeeping force was highlighted when differences between france and the united states forced the united nations to again postpone a planned meeting thursday with potential contributors to the mission . france , which is considered a probable leader of the international force , had refused to attend thursday 's meeting because there was no agreement on a political accord . " france believes that the conditions for the force 's deployment have not been met and so this meeting is premature , " french foreign ministry spokesman denis simonneau said in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council is yet to pass a resolution on the current situation in lebanon diplomats said france had distributed a new draft resolution on the middle east crisis , which was to be discussed at a un security council meeting .
it still called for an " immediate cessation of hostilities " but also calls for " full respect " by both sides of the blue line , the marker used by the un to confirm the withdrawal of israeli troops from lebanon in may 2000 after a 22-year occupation . a security council resolution on the conflict has been held up by the issue of whether international peacekeepers should move in before an outline of a political settlement between israel , hezbollah and the lebanese government has been arranged . france , which is a key contributor to the current un interim force in southern lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , insists that a political settlement must be in place to give any international force a proper mandate to police the region .
the us , on the other hand , wants to see the forces in place before a political settlement is reached . double standards the un failure to act drew the ire of the muslim nations . " they are perplexed in the face of gross double standards applied by the international community , " said ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , the turkish head of the organization of islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- . prominent members of the 57-nation bloc , including iran as well as allies of the us " war on terror " such as turkey and pakistan , condemned what they called the " relentless israeli aggression " and called for an immediate truce . beirut under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert meanwhile , israeli warplanes thundered over beirut on thursday after a six-day lull in an onslaught that lebanese officials say has killed more than 900 nationals and wounded over 3,000 others over three weeks . fifty israelis have died . israeli premier ehud olmert said his country would pursue its drive against hezbollah guerrillas in south lebanon until an international force of some 15,000 combat-ready troops was deployed there .

we would be proud to do it . " it was another example of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's skill at gathering the population to him and whipping them into a frenzy of support with populist rhetoric .
speaking at a rally in the province of lorestan in march , ahmadinejad showed again how easy it was to get the iranian people on side - by showing that he was one of them . his simple lifestyle and his ability to distance himself from the corruption that has dogged many other politicians in his country adds credibility to his " man of the people " approach and sets him apart from his predecessors . these qualities and this approach were the primary forces behind ahmadinejad 's election victory on june 25 , 2005 .
in only the second round of the ballot , ahmadinejad secured 61 percent of the vote to end the challenges of the favorite ali akbar rafsanjani , leading to former parliamentary leader mehdi karroubi accusing the newly anointed president of electoral fraud . such claims and other voices of dissent have been silent for some time .

the qualified engineer-turned-president , who was only two years before made mayor of tehran , made it easier for the man on the street to get cheap loans , buy homes and also health insurance . however , it soon became clear that on the domestic front , as well as in the international arena , ahmadinejad would be no trouble-free president .
he appointed old companions from his time with the revolutionary guards in ministerial and other posts - some of whom he then had to replace again after embarrassing displays of incompetence - and he began to distinguish himself in the wider world , making enemies and friends in equal measure . a damning appraisal of the un " justice should be of the utmost importance in this organization and according to its charter , all member states should have the same rights , " he told the united nations assembly during his first speech at the un .
" bigger power or bigger wealth should not provide any member with more rights than any other . " his speech set a precedent for bating the un .
as tensions increased over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad resolutely rejected every compromise offered as an unreasonable capitulation .
he then further angered the international community by ostentatiously celebrating iran 's first successful enrichment of uranium . at the same time , ahmadinejad opened a second front by launching scathing attacks on israel , quoting the revolutionary leader ayatollah khomeini by stating the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and adding his own words on holocaust denial . holocaust denial caused outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad favors explosive rhetoric " if the europeans say that they killed 6 million jews in the second world war ; if you have really burned 6 million jews in the ovens … and this seems to be correct because you maintain this over and over again and punish everybody which is of another opinion , you even condemn your scholars who are of another opinion … .so , we ask you : if you have really committed this big crime - why should the suppressed palestinian people be punished for it ?

3 ; since then , his words and actions have made his country and the wider world captive audiences . usa : ahmadinejad 's public enemy no.1 with populist outpourings , virulent anti-israeli and anti-american rhetoric and a self-confident and provocative posture in the crisis over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad has created more foreign policy problems for his country in just one year than any of his predecessors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad made a point of antagonizing bush the target of most of his vitriol is the west and , specifically , the united states : " they accuse our people of violating human rights and freedom .
if god wants it , we will put -lrb- the americans -rrb- before people 's courts .
our people have culture and civilization ; ours are free and revolutionary people . " these people were promised a remedy for the unfulfilled hopes and the underprivileged existence of many of their number after ahmadinejad 's election victory .
the qualified engineer-turned-president , who was only two years before made mayor of tehran , made it easier for the man on the street to get cheap loans , buy homes and also health insurance . however , it soon became clear that on the domestic front , as well as in the international arena , ahmadinejad would be no trouble-free president .
he appointed old companions from his time with the revolutionary guards in ministerial and other posts - some of whom he then had to replace again after embarrassing displays of incompetence - and he began to distinguish himself in the wider world , making enemies and friends in equal measure . a damning appraisal of the un " justice should be of the utmost importance in this organization and according to its charter , all member states should have the same rights , " he told the united nations assembly during his first speech at the un .
" bigger power or bigger wealth should not provide any member with more rights than any other . " his speech set a precedent for bating the un .
as tensions increased over iran 's nuclear ambitions , ahmadinejad resolutely rejected every compromise offered as an unreasonable capitulation .
he then further angered the international community by ostentatiously celebrating iran 's first successful enrichment of uranium . at the same time , ahmadinejad opened a second front by launching scathing attacks on israel , quoting the revolutionary leader ayatollah khomeini by stating the jewish state should be " wiped off the map " and adding his own words on holocaust denial . holocaust denial caused outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad favors explosive rhetoric " if the europeans say that they killed 6 million jews in the second world war ; if you have really burned 6 million jews in the ovens … and this seems to be correct because you maintain this over and over again and punish everybody which is of another opinion , you even condemn your scholars who are of another opinion … .so , we ask you : if you have really committed this big crime - why should the suppressed palestinian people be punished for it ? " " if you have committed a crime , you yourselves should pay for it .
our suggestion remains unchanged : if you have committed a crime , it is only right that you make part of your own land available - in europe , the usa , canada or alaska - and establish -lrb- a jewish state -rrb- there .
you could be assured that the iranian people have nothing against it . " ahmadinejad 's comments caused an international storm of outrage , which gave the iranian president the affirmation he needed to increase his attacks .
he compared the us administration , for example , to genghis khan and then likened israel to hitler 's third reich .
in the muslim world , ahmadinejad scored many points with his provocation , even in arab countries which had a natural distrust of iran but saw he was a man of conviction who was ready to take on the us and israel . stance has further alienated iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attitudes to iran in the west have hardened catastrophically , that loathing and irritation of the west colored the nuclear question and the west 's posture towards iran began to harden . a year after mahmoud ahmadinejad took office ; he has inspired much debate and has acquired mass support in his own country but has consequently painted iran into a corner .
if one is searching for a reason why , the most logical explanation would be that ahmadinejad would like to restore the atmosphere of the early islamic republic .

the guardian of the euro is concerned about the inflationary effects of oil prices and economic growth . it also increased its other two key rates - the deposit rate and the marginal lending rate - by 0.25 percentage point to 2.00 percent and 4.00 percent respectively . the announcement had been expected and the euro remained stable at about 1.2770 dollars .
the british rate increase , by contrast , had caught the foreign exchange market by surprise and sterling rose . normally , the ecb council holds its august meeting in the summer holiday period by means of a teleconference .
but this year , the 18-strong board was convening in person at the ecb 's eurotower headquarters in frankfurt , a sure sign that a move in interest rates was on the cards . the meeting was also attended by eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . worries about inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecb president jean-claude trichet said the rate could go up even further in the future inflationary risks are rising in the 12-country euro zone , primarily as a result of high oil prices , european central bank president jean-claude trichet said on thursday . " the risks to the outlook for price developments have augmented , " the ecb chief told a news conference after the increase was announced . the main risks included " further increases in oil prices , a stronger-than-anticipated pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices , and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , " the frenchman said . he added that euro-zone interest rates are likely to be rise still further . with area-wide growth currently above trend , inflation above target and credit and money supply growth accelerating strongly , the ecb believes higher borrowing costs are necessary to nip inflation the bud . area-wide inflation stood at 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in june , far above the ecb 's ceiling of 2.0 percent , fuelled by runaway energy prices . the bank is concerned that energy price developments may trigger so-called " second-round " effects , with demands for higher wages to compensate for the high price of petrol and heating oil leading to an inflation spiral . as yet , there is no sign of that happening , but the ecb believes that prevention is better than cure . about time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sky-high energy prices have economists worried commerzbank chief economist jörg krämer said the tightening move on thursday was " long overdue " . " the euro area economy is growing solidly at 1.8 percent and the money supply has been expanding faster over the past four or five years than the ecb would like .
the rate hike is therefore no danger to the economy , " krämer said on deutsche welle television dw-tv . the rate rise marks an acceleration in the tightening cycle , and commerzbank 's krämer said he believed the " refi " rate could stand at 3.50 percent by the end of the year . " i assume there will be two follow-up moves in october and december , " he said .
german economy minister michael glos said thursday that the european central bank 's decision to raise its key interest rates again was proof the current economic recovery was gathering strength and momentum . " in recent months , economic activity in the euro area , and in germany in particular , has increasingly gained strength , " glos said in a short statement . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers find world cup triggers stock market response like many a soccer ball in germany right now , the german stock market has been bouncing up and down and round this week .

" the troops should be lead by the french , " primor said in an interview for the german television news program tagesschau on wednesday .
" the french have a real interest in lebanon , but they need support .
and the only support that is valuable to the french is german support . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador to germany avi primor the german army is already involved in several international operations today - most notably in kosovo , afghanistan and congo .
but the question of its possible deployment near the israeli border is an extremely sensitive issue in both countries . " i do n't think that the german troops could be stationed on the border between israel and germany because of possible frictions .
but the german army could be helpful in logistical matters and perhaps also help prevent the influx of weapons into northern lebanon from syria . " but in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung daily to be published on friday , israeli leader ehud olmert said his country would have no problem with german soldiers taking part in peacekeeping operations in southern lebanon . " i would be very happy if germany took part , " he said .
" there is at present no other country that acts more friendly toward israel than germany . " diplomatic indecision the difficulty of assembling such an international peacekeeping force was highlighted when differences between france and the united states forced the united nations to again postpone a planned meeting thursday with potential contributors to the mission . france , which is considered a probable leader of the international force , had refused to attend thursday 's meeting because there was no agreement on a political accord . " france believes that the conditions for the force 's deployment have not been met and so this meeting is premature , " french foreign ministry spokesman denis simonneau said in paris . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council is yet to pass a resolution on the current situation in lebanon diplomats said france had distributed a new draft resolution on the middle east crisis , which was to be discussed at a un security council meeting .
it still called for an " immediate cessation of hostilities " but also calls for " full respect " by both sides of the blue line , the marker used by the un to confirm the withdrawal of israeli troops from lebanon in may 2000 after a 22-year occupation . a security council resolution on the conflict has been held up by the issue of whether international peacekeepers should move in before an outline of a political settlement between israel , hezbollah and the lebanese government has been arranged . france , which is a key contributor to the current un interim force in southern lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- , insists that a political settlement must be in place to give any international force a proper mandate to police the region .
the us , on the other hand , wants to see the forces in place before a political settlement is reached . double standards the un failure to act drew the ire of the muslim nations . " they are perplexed in the face of gross double standards applied by the international community , " said ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , the turkish head of the organization of islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- . prominent members of the 57-nation bloc , including iran as well as allies of the us " war on terror " such as turkey and pakistan , condemned what they called the " relentless israeli aggression " and called for an immediate truce . beirut under attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert meanwhile , israeli warplanes thundered over beirut on thursday after a six-day lull in an onslaught that lebanese officials say has killed more than 900 nationals and wounded over 3,000 others over three weeks . fifty israelis have died . israeli premier ehud olmert said his country would pursue its drive against hezbollah guerrillas in south lebanon until an international force of some 15,000 combat-ready troops was deployed there .

but the reform plan she 's released has been roundly condemned and even brought thousands of protesters out onto the streets . germany has one of the best health care systems in the world , but experts have said for years that it wo n't stay that way unless it is substantially reformed .
the system faces a massive budget shortfall , largely due to a financing structure that no longer works in today 's germany due to rising costs , low birth rates and stubbornly high unemployment . a reform plan hammered out by merkel 's coalition government of left-of-center social democrats and conservative christian democrats was released last month to the public and immediately was subjected to scathing criticism by everyone from health care providers , unions and analysts to business leaders and even parts of merkel 's own government . it brought health care employees onto the streets , protesting at what they fear will be huge job losses , and sparked a highly visible feud between the heads of public health insurance companies and german health minister ulla schmidt , who has threatened to use legal means to punish those companies if they use patients ' health care contributions to fund a campaign critical of the government 's plan . the whole thing has left most members of the public shaking their heads , unsure of what the changes mean or if the high-quality health care to which they 've become accustomed is terminally ill . the problem germany 's health care system consists of 252 public health insurance companies , which cover almost 90 percent of the population , about 73 million people .
the other 10 percent – mostly high earners and the self-employed - are covered by private insurance plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no magic pill to make it all better , unfortunately the system is funded by contributions from employers and employees , who pay just under 14 percent of their salaries into it .
still , next year , there will be an expected shortfall of 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9 billion -rrb- . " there have to be difference sources of revenue .
we 've basically said the financing basis has to be broadened , " said barbara marnach , deputy spokesman of the aok public health plan , one of germany 's largest , which began lobbying hard as politicians took up the health care reform issue seriously in the spring . july saw the end of months of haggling over how to fill up quickly draining health care coffers , and several competing plans were put forward .
there was talk of introducing a flat health insurance fee , doing away with private plans to bring the well-off – and their money - back into the public fold , raising taxes or increasing employee contribution rates . everyone agreed something had to be done ; no one could agree what that something was .
all the proposals were potential political minefields . the proposed solution instead of raising taxes , which proved politically impossible due to an already scheduled increase in value-added tax in 2007 , the reform plan will ask that employer / employee contributions be increased by 0.5 percent next year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans will have to start paying for more services that were once covered by basic plans a new " health fund " will be introduced in 2008 into which those contributions will be paid , sweetened with some tax revenues -lrb- 1.5 billion euros in 2008 -rrb- from the federal government , mainly to cover health insurance for children .
the fund will pay out a flat fee , set by the government , for every insured person to the public insurance companies .
previously , individual health plans have collected workers ' contributions on their own . merkel called it a " breakthrough " and health minister schmidt has said it will reduce bureaucracy , boost competition and cut cost in a system which swallows around 140 billion euros -lrb- $ 179 billion -rrb- a year and employs 4.2 million people . the uproar but others are calling it by different names - " wasteful " , for example , saying the plan does little to cure the system 's ailments in the long term .
instead of cutting bureaucracy , it creates a whole new one , said aok 's marnach . " and that means now new organizations and procedures will have to be created , which brings with it more costs , " she said .
" the simple question is , what good is it going to do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's little love lost these days between health minister ulla schmidt and health insurance companies public insurers argue the reform plan runs counter to the goals set out by the government , since it will put more power in the government 's hands and give public insurance companies less ability to compete . " we have n't gotten more authority to act on the free market , rather this reform leads to further socialization .
it will simply be less efficient , " said marnach . some say the proposed reforms are a decent start , given the monumental nature of the task , although they are few .
sophia schlette , head of health care policy for the bertelsmann foundation , says the fears of creating a lumbering new bureaucracy are overblown . " the countries that do better when it comes to costs and various health care indicators are interestingly enough those country that have what here is being described as the horror scenario of the single health fund system , " she told german public radio . it also has some of those four million health insurance company employees worried about their jobs .
last week , 21,000 of them took to the streets in five cities demanding that the government rethink its reform plan , which according to marnach , could lead to a loss of some 25,000 jobs . if not this reform , which ? the reform plan 's vocal critics claim they are not just complaining about change and fully agree that reform is needed - just not this jumble of reforms that no one , not even members of the coalition government , seem particularly happy about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say political realities of germany 's left-right coalition goverment are standing in the way of real reform competing interests and political moves to keep the governing coalition from collapsing in a health care fight are both to blame for the watered-down compromise that was put forward , according to herbert weisbrod-frey , head of the health care policy department at the ver.di service union .

brit abroad ?
get involved have your say share your pictures but when asked about whether they would actually ever go , 13 % said they were hoping to in the near future , almost twice the number asked the question in 2003 .
young people were the most likely to want to leave , with a quarter saying they were hoping to live abroad .
when asked why they would go , the most important reasons were a better quality of life , better weather and a feeling that the uk is too expensive .
some 12 % said they did not like what the uk had become while one in 10 said they already had friends or family overseas .
the most popular choices for emigration were australia , spain , canada , new zealand and the us .
the opinion poll results reflect trends in the limited national statistics on emigration .
according to official figures , record numbers of people have been emigrating with 350,000 having left in 2004 - up a third on ten years .
six-month project the institute of public policy research , a think tank , is trying to count as many expats as possible in a project running through 2006 .

foreign office minister lord triesman , who commissioned the ippr 's research , said that government needed to know not only where people have gone - but also what this tells us about how people migrate in a globalised world .
" it 's clear that more british people are going to live abroad , " said lord triesman .
" up to 14 million britons live overseas for at least part of the year .

this morning on breakfast , we spoke to dominic casciani from the bbc news website - watch that interview again from the link to the right of this page we also heard from zilpah hartley , presenter of channel 4 's place in the sun programme according to the national poll , more than half of british people have considered emigrating in their life time .
brit abroad ?
get involved have your say share your pictures but when asked about whether they would actually ever go , 13 % said they were hoping to in the near future , almost twice the number asked the question in 2003 .
young people were the most likely to want to leave , with a quarter saying they were hoping to live abroad .
when asked why they would go , the most important reasons were a better quality of life , better weather and a feeling that the uk is too expensive .
some 12 % said they did not like what the uk had become while one in 10 said they already had friends or family overseas .
the most popular choices for emigration were australia , spain , canada , new zealand and the us .
the opinion poll results reflect trends in the limited national statistics on emigration .
according to official figures , record numbers of people have been emigrating with 350,000 having left in 2004 - up a third on ten years .
six-month project the institute of public policy research , a think tank , is trying to count as many expats as possible in a project running through 2006 .
the figures are due to be available in depth for the public on the bbc news website at the end of the year and in the meantime it is appealing for readers to contribute with stories and experiences .
the aim is to reveal the untold themes , issues and tales about british life abroad that do not appear in official research sources .
danny sriskandarajah , associate director of ippr , said he believed the uk 's apparent fondness for emigration was the " neglected side " of the migration debate .
" emigration from the uk has important policy implications that have not received enough attention , " he said .
" we need to understand more about what will happen as more young people head off on overseas adventures , more skilled people are lured away by other countries , and more pensioners retire to all corners of the map .
" britain has developed a particularly global outlook thanks to centuries of flows in and out .
" the challenge for british policymakers will be to harness the economic and political potential of one of the largest diasporas in the world . "
foreign office minister lord triesman , who commissioned the ippr 's research , said that government needed to know not only where people have gone - but also what this tells us about how people migrate in a globalised world .
" it 's clear that more british people are going to live abroad , " said lord triesman .
" up to 14 million britons live overseas for at least part of the year .
to deliver the consular services and assistance to which british residents overseas are entitled , we need more accurate information on how many there are , and where they are going .
recent events in lebanon highlighted the important of this . "
taking part over the coming months , the bbc news website wants to hear your stories of life abroad as people who have left the uk behind - and what it means to you .
we are also appealing for you to send your pictures and , where possible , video .
the information you send will help us to build a global picture of expat life , whether you are someone who has recently emigrated , or someone who has not been back for 40 years .

health and social services minister brian gibbons is unveiling the draft strategy later on thursday .
it aims to complement the government 's 10-year designed for life health plan which was announced last year .
the number of people currently using social services has risen by 50 % over the past five years to 150,000 .
the strategy , called fulfilled lives , supportive communities , aims to help more people remain living in their homes .
the strategy states : " social services are not yet at the standard with which we can all be satisfied .
" they must improve and do so at a greater pace in the future . "
demand for many services is expected to increase but lots of staff posts remain unfilled , budgets are under pressure and standards are too variable .
the assembly government is to consult on five key issues in the draft strategy .
they include a higher profile for services , " coherent services " offering continuity of care and a greater focus on early prevention .
' independence ' the draft strategy also aims for local authorities to commission and provide services but shape a " mixed market " of public , private and voluntary care .
dr gibbons said : " modernising social services in wales is key to providing accessible personalised care for users .
" social services need to focus more on prevention by intervening at an earlier stage to help families and retain people 's independence .
" this personal support needs to link with wider community strategies which underpin this approach . "
he will unveil the draft strategy in newport on thursday .
the welsh local government association said it would provide constructive input into the consultation process .

nottinghamshire police want to hear about drunk-drivers and those who are disqualified , uninsured or unlicensed .
operating alongside the crimestoppers service , officers said the public were the best way of getting more unsafe vehicles off the road .
they accepted people might be reluctant to cause trouble for friends but said one call could save lives .
i think information on a car 's mot and the driver 's licence should be displayed on the windscreen geoff pay , father of crash victim sarah smithurst , regional co-ordinator for crimestoppers , said : " it 's not just a question of these people putting themselves at risk .
" if someone chooses to drive drunk or in an unroadworthy car they are risking the lives of not only the other people in the car but all the other drivers , passengers and pedestrians they pass . "
geoff pay , from hucknall in nottingham , lost his daughter kirsty in a car crash near mablethorpe , lincolnshire , four years ago .
the driver , who also died in the crash , was disqualified at the time and the car had originally been sold as scrap , not for use on the road .
mr pay said : " it all happens so quickly .
one minute you are chatting to them and the next they are gone .
" i do not believe kirsty would have got into a car if she knew it was illegal or unsafe .
" i think information on a car 's mot and the driver 's licence should be displayed on the windscreen alongside the tax disc . "

mr morales was speaking at a ceremony in central bolivia , where he handed out 2,300 land titles and 50 new tractors .
mr morales 's government has handed out a substantial area of state-owned land already , but is seeking the right to expropriate unproductive private land .
however these plans have been fiercely opposed by landowners .
' land politics ' mr morales made his remarks during the ceremony in urucena , a town in the central department of cochabamba , where in 1953 the first agrarian reform was launched in bolivia .
the principle objective of the government was , he said , " to expropriate unproductive land , which performs no social or economic function " and give it to those without land .
" if in bolivia we do not resolve the social and economic problems of the indigenous and peasant communities we will never be able to resolve the economic problems of the nation , and for this reason we have the obligation to change the politics of the land , " he said , according to the news agency efe .
mr morales , himself an aymara indian , referred to the " historical injustice " of the spanish conquest of bolivia 500 years ago .
tractors mr morales arrived at the ceremony on a tractor , leading a convoy of 50 venezuelan-made tractors which were distributed to agricultural workers .
he promised hundreds more tractors would be distributed to bolivia 's impoverished peasants - some of whom still use ox-driven ploughs to furrow the fields .
at the ceremony - attended by some 20,000 supporters - he also handed out some 2,300 new land titles .
the total area of land handed out on this occasion was not reported , but the government is said to have distributed 24,800 sq km -lrb- 9,600 sq miles -rrb- since the agrarian reform programme started in june .
at present mr morales is restricted to handing out state-owned land , and so far congress has failed to back plans to redistribute privately owned land which is unproductive , obtained illegally or used for speculation .
on wednesday , mr morales suggested he might bypass senate opposition through presidential decree or a change in the constitution .
mr morales has vowed to redistribute 200,000 sq km - an area double the size of portugal - by the end of his term in 2011 .
but the programme has enraged landowners , with bolivia 's main landowners ' federation pledging to form " self-defence groups " to defend their land .
one landowners ' group has called the plan " a nuclear bomb for bolivian agriculture " .

his morning show attracted an average of 6.79 million listeners a week between april and june , according to radio joint audience research -lrb- rajar -rrb- .
that was up 470,000 on the previous quarter .
radio 1 saw its total audience rise by 700,000 to 10.4 million .
radio 2 also saw an increase , with terry wogan and ken bruce helping swell its ratings to 13.29 million .
bruce had a particularly successful period , achieving a record audience of 6.64 million for his mid-morning programme exactly 20 years after it began .
hard-fought battle in his first set of ratings since taking over radio 2 's drivetime show from johnnie walker , chris evans recorded listener figures of 4.85 million a week .
his audience is down 150,000 compared with his predecessor 's last show but is on a par with previous years .
capital radio 's johnny vaughn remains london 's top breakfast dj , despite losing 111,000 listeners since the first three months of 2006 .
in a hard-fought battle for the city 's morning audience , his 852,000 audience puts him just ahead of heart 's jamie theakston with 820,000 and magic 's neil fox with 803,000 .

mr morales was speaking at a ceremony in central bolivia , where he handed out 2,300 land titles and 50 new tractors .
mr morales 's government has handed out a substantial area of state-owned land already , but is seeking the right to expropriate unproductive private land .
however these plans have been fiercely opposed by landowners .
' land politics ' mr morales made his remarks during the ceremony in urucena , a town in the central department of cochabamba , where in 1953 the first agrarian reform was launched in bolivia .
the principle objective of the government was , he said , " to expropriate unproductive land , which performs no social or economic function " and give it to those without land .
" if in bolivia we do not resolve the social and economic problems of the indigenous and peasant communities we will never be able to resolve the economic problems of the nation , and for this reason we have the obligation to change the politics of the land , " he said , according to the news agency efe .
mr morales , himself an aymara indian , referred to the " historical injustice " of the spanish conquest of bolivia 500 years ago .
tractors mr morales arrived at the ceremony on a tractor , leading a convoy of 50 venezuelan-made tractors which were distributed to agricultural workers .
the senate has so far failed to allow private lands to be seized he promised hundreds more tractors would be distributed to bolivia 's impoverished peasants - some of whom still use ox-driven ploughs to furrow the fields .
at the ceremony - attended by some 20,000 supporters - he also handed out some 2,300 new land titles .
the total area of land handed out on this occasion was not reported , but the government is said to have distributed 24,800 sq km -lrb- 9,600 sq miles -rrb- since the agrarian reform programme started in june .
at present mr morales is restricted to handing out state-owned land , and so far congress has failed to back plans to redistribute privately owned land which is unproductive , obtained illegally or used for speculation .
on wednesday , mr morales suggested he might bypass senate opposition through presidential decree or a change in the constitution .
mr morales has vowed to redistribute 200,000 sq km - an area double the size of portugal - by the end of his term in 2011 .
but the programme has enraged landowners , with bolivia 's main landowners ' federation pledging to form " self-defence groups " to defend their land .
one landowners ' group has called the plan " a nuclear bomb for bolivian agriculture " .

chief inspector dr andrew mclellan said this made it hard to meet inmates ' needs at cornton vale , stirling .
he also said questions surrounded the practice of routinely " double-cuffing " and pointed to two cases where pregnant inmates were handcuffed during labour .
however , dr mclellan praised improved living conditions and the arrangements for maintaining family contact .
the findings in his report were based on an inspection of cornton vale prison and young offenders institution in february .
during the inspection the number of prisoners was 326 , half of whom were convicted of violent offences . "
their time of imprisonment is unlikely to heal the desperate things that are wrong with them " dr andrew mclellan hm chief inspector of prisons dr mclellan said in 1998 prison and social work chiefs had called for a joint strategy to reduce the daily female population at cornton vale from more than 170 to 100 or less by the end of 2000 .
" today that sounds fanciful , " he said .
his report found that boredom was a major problem and the time inmates spent in cells was increasing .
he also noted that there had been a reduction in psychology services .
" many of these women arrive at the prison gate in a desperate state , suffering from a combination of mental and physical ill health , " dr mclellan said .
" for most prisoners in cornton vale their time of imprisonment is unlikely to heal the desperate things that are wrong with them in body , mind and spirit when they are admitted . "
humanity issues the report said the greatest concern raised by prisoners and staff was double-cuffing .
prisoners leaving cornton vale for any reason , except for a work placement , have their wrists handcuffed together and then handcuffed to a custody officer .
prison staff told inspectors of cases where no mother was present at a children 's hearing because prisoners could not bring themselves to be double-cuffed in front of their children .
staff also told of women refusing to go to hospital for medical treatment when they learned that they would be double-cuffed and women being handcuffed during labour .
dr mclellan said : " there is always a balance to be found between security and humanity , but in the case of women giving birth the security considerations would need to be extraordinarily high to justify this practice . "
the report pointed to some good work with addictions and mental health and said there had been a significant reduction in the number of women harming themselves .
it also praised the living conditions in the new residential accommodation and better living arrangements for offenders under the age of 21 .
dr mclellan 's predecessor clive fairweather , who was chief inspector between 1994 and 2002 , said the figures were " very disappointing " .
he said large numbers of women were still being sent to jail for petty offending .
' truly shocking ' these were often " desperate individuals " rather than people from whom the public needed protection .
" there could be a lot more done in terms of funding community sentences , " he said .
scottish conservative justice spokeswoman margaret mitchell described the number of female prisoners as " truly shocking " and said the vast majority had committed drug-related crimes .
" rather than focusing on details to do with the management of prisoners , dr mclellan should be pressing to ensure that the time spent in prison is used to give prisoners the opportunity to become drug free and to end the addiction and cycle of abuse which resulted in them being imprisoned in the first place , " she said .

chief inspector dr andrew mclellan said this made it hard to meet inmates ' needs at cornton vale , stirling .
he also said questions surrounded the practice of routinely " double-cuffing " and pointed to two cases where pregnant inmates were handcuffed during labour .
however , dr mclellan praised improved living conditions and the arrangements for maintaining family contact .
the findings in his report were based on an inspection of cornton vale prison and young offenders institution in february .
during the inspection the number of prisoners was 326 , half of whom were convicted of violent offences .
their time of imprisonment is unlikely to heal the desperate things that are wrong with them dr andrew mclellan hm chief inspector of prisons dr mclellan said in 1998 prison and social work chiefs had called for a joint strategy to reduce the daily female population at cornton vale from more than 170 to 100 or less by the end of 2000 .
" today that sounds fanciful , " he said .
his report found that boredom was a major problem and the time inmates spent in cells was increasing .
he also noted that there had been a reduction in psychology services .
" many of these women arrive at the prison gate in a desperate state , suffering from a combination of mental and physical ill health , " dr mclellan said .
" for most prisoners in cornton vale their time of imprisonment is unlikely to heal the desperate things that are wrong with them in body , mind and spirit when they are admitted . "
humanity issues the report said the greatest concern raised by prisoners and staff was double-cuffing .
prisoners leaving cornton vale for any reason , except for a work placement , have their wrists handcuffed together and then handcuffed to a custody officer .
prison staff told inspectors of cases where no mother was present at a children 's hearing because prisoners could not bring themselves to be double-cuffed in front of their children .
dr andrew mclellan raised questions over " double-cuffing " staff also told of women refusing to go to hospital for medical treatment when they learned that they would be double-cuffed and women being handcuffed during labour .
dr mclellan said : " there is always a balance to be found between security and humanity , but in the case of women giving birth the security considerations would need to be extraordinarily high to justify this practice . "
the report pointed to some good work with addictions and mental health and said there had been a significant reduction in the number of women harming themselves .
it also praised the living conditions in the new residential accommodation and better living arrangements for offenders under the age of 21 .
dr mclellan 's predecessor clive fairweather , who was chief inspector between 1994 and 2002 , said the figures were " very disappointing " .
he said large numbers of women were still being sent to jail for petty offending .
' truly shocking ' these were often " desperate individuals " rather than people from whom the public needed protection .
" there could be a lot more done in terms of funding community sentences , " he said .
scottish conservative justice spokeswoman margaret mitchell described the number of female prisoners as " truly shocking " and said the vast majority had committed drug-related crimes .
" rather than focusing on details to do with the management of prisoners , dr mclellan should be pressing to ensure that the time spent in prison is used to give prisoners the opportunity to become drug free and to end the addiction and cycle of abuse which resulted in them being imprisoned in the first place , " she said .

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- fighting diminishes ceasefire hopes home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog languages arabic persian pashto turkish french more last updated : thursday , 3 august 2006 , 09:24 gmt 10:24 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version fighting diminishes ceasefire hopes analysis by paul reynolds world affairs correspondent , bbc news website it is almost as if things are back to square one - the israeli army is on the move into southern lebanon , its air force is attacking again , hezbollah is not beaten and diplomacy is doubtful .
yet only on monday the us secretary of state condoleezza rice was saying as she left jerusalem that she hoped for a ceasefire resolution to be passed by the security council by the end of the week .
then came a strong speech in the north of israel -lrb- under rocket attack since the war began -rrb- by prime minister ehud olmert .
using churchillian phrases - " pain , tears and blood " - he made it quite clear there would be no ceasefire in the coming days .
it seems that israeli determination had been underestimated .
it also seems that mr olmert himself had earlier underestimated the public and military mood .
both the prospect of an end to the fighting before the aims were achieved and the 48-hour cessation of air strikes post qana were seen as unsettling .
the mass circulation daily yediot ahronot said : " if israel fails in this war , it will be impossible to live in the middle east . "
ephraim sneh , labour mp and a former general said : " this war must not end in a draw . "
a late-night meeting of the seven-strong security cabinet decided to expand the military operation further into lebanon .
-lrb- update on thursday : mr olmert has made another comment to the effect that israel will not stop until an international force arrives in southern lebanon .
this appears to indicate several more weeks of fighting .
he also interestingly stated israel 's current war aims - " to push hezbollah more and more from where they were and open up for the international force to take over " .
this is scaling back from the initial israeli statements about destroying hezbollah .
he also spoke of a need for about 15,000 international troops , mentioning france , italy , britain -lsb- which has already ruled itself out -rsb- and turkey as examples of possible contributors , who could enforce a peace .
mr olmert also stated israel 's intention of driving the civilian population out of southern lebanon as a way of breaking support ofr hezbollah . -rrb-
the difficulties of assembling an international force and drawing up its powers are become clearer every day .
the israelis want a combat-capable force that could keep the peace but lebanon says that hezbollah agreement is necessary first .
hezbollah , it is widely felt , would not accept being policed by such a force . -rrb-
' buffer zone ' plan the plan now seems to be that israel will try to set up its so-called " buffer zone " -lrb- the lebanese will call it an occupied zone -rrb- which it will hold until an international force arrives to take over .
that could take some weeks .
the likely depth of this zone is not certain .
some israelis talk of about 8km -lrb- five miles -rrb- ; others say it should go as far as the litani river , up to 30km north of the border -lrb- though it is much closer in the east because of a curve north in the border -rrb- .
but with fighting still heavy in border villages , going to the litani along its length would need a considerable force .
within the " zone " , israel intends to clear out hezbollah positions and fighters .
human rights groups fear it is also clearing out civilians with dangerous implications .
human rights watch said on monday israel was creating a " free-fire " zone in southern lebanon .
and if israel occupies any lebanese land for any period , it runs the risk of getting bogged down in a guerrilla war .
indeed such is the confusion in the israeli camp that israel 's leading military commentator ze 'ev schiff of haaretz has concluded that " management of the war has been incompetent " .
he points out that it has already gone on for nearly as long as the yom kippur war in 1973 .
how long will it take ?
one minister binyamin ben-eliezer said : " it will take approximately 10 days to two weeks . "
he also indicated that israel would not leave lebanon until its two missing soldiers were returned .
misreading mood ?
did ms rice misread the israeli mood , which seems to be more committed than perhaps some optimistic outsiders have realised ?
i estimate that for the idf to complete their job will take approximately 10 days to two weeks binyamin ben-eliezer , israeli minister there is still a view among some that the security council will in fact pass the necessary resolution soon and that israel will have to accept it .
much depends on what the us does , but condoleezza rice herself is in a difficult position .
she has in effect promised but delivery is uncertain .
will she be sidelined by a president bush unwavering in his support for israel ?
the episode raises the question as to whether israel and not the bush administration is calling the shots .
many israelis feel there is a need to " finish the job " .
just how that can be achieved is not so certain .
israeli officials say the air force has destroyed about two-thirds of the longer-range zelzal rockets hezbollah is said to have -lrb- although nobody is talking actual numbers , nor do they say how they know -rrb- .
but another official says israel can not possibly destroy all hezbollah missiles from the air .
so expectations might have to be lowered .
there is also now likely to be a gap between israel taking over its " zone " and the arrival of the international force .
that arrival is going to take some time to arrange .
meshing the military with the diplomacy will be complex .
and crucially hezbollah 's agreement or acquiescence will have to be sought .
in 1983 , us marines and french paratroopers were attacked by suicide bombers in beirut .
the troops were there as part of an international " peacekeeping force " to police an earlier phase of lebanon 's troubles .
