" we 're dealing with very special inventory here , " said günter bormann , a spokesman for the federal stasi files agency .

there 's plenty to do , " said spokesman gerd pfeiffer . there are about 600 million paper scraps in more than 16,000 sacks in storage in magdeburg packed with details of german history .
reconstruction at the present rate will take hundreds of years .
so wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , has called on parliament to agree to fund a pilot project to computerize reconstruction - despite germany 's tight budget position .

" we 're dealing with very special inventory here , " said günter bormann , a spokesman for the federal stasi files agency .

reconstruction at the present rate will take hundreds of years .
so wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , has called on parliament to agree to fund a pilot project to computerize reconstruction - despite germany 's tight budget position .

if lawmakers fund the project , germans could resolve unanswered questions within five rather than hundreds of years . west berlin journalist holger kulick often visited the east of the divided city in the 1980s .
after east and west germany were finally reunified , he got the reconstructed dossier compiled on him by east germany 's domestic intelligence service , the stasi , and found out that writer sascha anderson , a close friend in east berlin , had spied on him . " it was painful to read in the reconstituted files that he 'd obviously passed on what i 'd told him in confidence .
that an art professor in dresden was planning a project , and was looking for works by his former students who had left for the west , so that he could put them on exhibition .
and look here , the stasi had the information the very next day , " kulick told dw-tv . the majority of the files recovered after demonstrators stormed the stasi 's buildings in early 1990 had already been shredded . " we 're dealing with very special inventory here , " said günter bormann , a spokesman for the federal stasi files agency .
" these are files that were torn up manually , by hand , in the final weeks of the intelligence service .
so we may conclude that we 're dealing with fairly important documents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi staffers started shredding files when they saw the gdr 's downfall looming since 1995 , the stasi files agency has delivered sacks full of the scraps of paper to a small outpost in zirndorf , bavaria .
the staff there spends their days putting the pieces together .
in 11 years , they 've dealt with the contents of around 300 sacks .
ten pages a day " with one man reconstructing 10 pages a day and a sack holding about 2,500 , you can see how long it will take us before we have dealt with all the sacks still stored in magdeburg .
there 's plenty to do , " said spokesman gerd pfeiffer . there are about 600 million paper scraps in more than 16,000 sacks in storage in magdeburg packed with details of german history .
reconstruction at the present rate will take hundreds of years .
so wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , has called on parliament to agree to fund a pilot project to computerize reconstruction - despite germany 's tight budget position . " the most important principle we anchored into law was making this past accessible - to make this legacy available to the victims , researchers and the german public , " said thierse .
" and the consequence of that decision is that we are obliged to digitally reconstruct these torn-up files . " researchers at berlin 's fraunhofer institute have been testing digital reconstruction for years .
scraps of paper are scanned into a computer and , using recognition criteria like shape , color and typographical details , they are sorted and aligned using special software .
it only takes a few seconds to recreate a page .
experts estimate it would take around five years to reconstruct all the stasi files .
the pilot project would cost about 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on science europe 's quaero project aims to challenge google freud 's pivotal role in understanding the mind cebit searches for stability new technology promises more humane testing germany -pipe- 05.03.2006 piecing together east german history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new software could possibly piece together 600 million scraps in five years digital software could speed up the work of reconstructing shredded east german secret police files .
if lawmakers fund the project , germans could resolve unanswered questions within five rather than hundreds of years . west berlin journalist holger kulick often visited the east of the divided city in the 1980s .
after east and west germany were finally reunified , he got the reconstructed dossier compiled on him by east germany 's domestic intelligence service , the stasi , and found out that writer sascha anderson , a close friend in east berlin , had spied on him . " it was painful to read in the reconstituted files that he 'd obviously passed on what i 'd told him in confidence .
that an art professor in dresden was planning a project , and was looking for works by his former students who had left for the west , so that he could put them on exhibition .
and look here , the stasi had the information the very next day , " kulick told dw-tv . the majority of the files recovered after demonstrators stormed the stasi 's buildings in early 1990 had already been shredded . " we 're dealing with very special inventory here , " said günter bormann , a spokesman for the federal stasi files agency .
" these are files that were torn up manually , by hand , in the final weeks of the intelligence service .
so we may conclude that we 're dealing with fairly important documents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi staffers started shredding files when they saw the gdr 's downfall looming since 1995 , the stasi files agency has delivered sacks full of the scraps of paper to a small outpost in zirndorf , bavaria .
the staff there spends their days putting the pieces together .
in 11 years , they 've dealt with the contents of around 300 sacks .
ten pages a day " with one man reconstructing 10 pages a day and a sack holding about 2,500 , you can see how long it will take us before we have dealt with all the sacks still stored in magdeburg .
there 's plenty to do , " said spokesman gerd pfeiffer . there are about 600 million paper scraps in more than 16,000 sacks in storage in magdeburg packed with details of german history .
reconstruction at the present rate will take hundreds of years .
so wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , has called on parliament to agree to fund a pilot project to computerize reconstruction - despite germany 's tight budget position . " the most important principle we anchored into law was making this past accessible - to make this legacy available to the victims , researchers and the german public , " said thierse .
" and the consequence of that decision is that we are obliged to digitally reconstruct these torn-up files . " researchers at berlin 's fraunhofer institute have been testing digital reconstruction for years .
scraps of paper are scanned into a computer and , using recognition criteria like shape , color and typographical details , they are sorted and aligned using special software .
it only takes a few seconds to recreate a page .
experts estimate it would take around five years to reconstruct all the stasi files .
the pilot project would cost about 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- .
interest from abroad police and tax authorities have shown interest in the process , both in germany and abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi sorted the scraps into bags according to room and desk , which makes reconstruction easier " many people are already coming here from abroad , from former communist countries , and also from other former dictatorships : spain , argentina , south africa , " thierse said .
" they want to see how the germans do it , how they deal with their history .
how do they make it possible for people who were victims of dictatorships to understand their own biography ?
how can justice be restored to the victims of dictatorship ? " journalist kulick was one of the first in germany to see his stasi file , painstakingly restored by hand .
without these documents , he would probably never have found out the extent to which his former friend sascha anderson had spied on him . " if it had n't been for these master puzzle-solvers , sascha anderson would probably still be an unsolved mystery , and no one would know exactly what he 's really done , " said kulick . there 's a good chance the bundestag will agree to fund the computer project .
and not too soon , since the history-laden contents of the sacks are in danger of deteriorating over time . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long shadow of stasi still darkens aspects of german life despite being disbanded 16 years ago , the legacy of the east german secret police - the stasi - continues to taint people in the public eye .

" research and development is in our national interest and iran will not go back on that , " he told a news conference .
" going to the security council will certainly not make iran go back on research and development . " he added that tehran would instead retaliate to such a move by pressing ahead with full-scale uranium enrichment work . international concerns are centered on iran 's bid to master uranium enrichment , even via small-scale research .

" we are ready to remove concerns and we accept to have a timetable for enrichment , " he said . the united states and the european powers , however , have already said that such a concession does not go far enough and want to see iran halt all work related to enrichment and show greater cooperation with the iaea 's now three-year-old investigation . with security council action likely , western powers have been mulling what pressure - including possible sanctions - could be used against iran if it refuses to return to a moratorium on sensitive nuclear work . using oil to retaliate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could iran turn off its oil pipelines ?
but iran , opec 's second biggest producer , has consistently warned that any sanctions would have worse consequences for the rest of the world . " we have no interest in using oil as a weapon because we respect the psychological security of the international community , " larijani said , repeating iran 's position that it would not initiate such a move .

" we had the draw which would have been fine but we wanted more .
the team needs to understand that we are playing for the german title here not some local championship . " it was hamburg 's second victory over bayern this season having won 2-0 in september . untimely defeat for bayern the defeat was untimely with a crucial champions league showdown at ac milan to come on wednesday . milan have a slight edge after scoring a priceless away goal in the 1-1 first leg stalemate in munich . " we were too passive and not aggressive enough , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" we have a big game against milan coming up but that is no excuse . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's dutch rafael van der vaart -lrb- right -rrb- and munich 's martin demichelis on saturday kahn was missing from the first match with milan through a thigh injury and his return against hamburg was far from smooth . predicting a cross from cote d 'ivoire international guy demel , kahn dived accross the penalty area but demel curled the ball straight in for a 16th minute lead . scholl looked to have saved bayern seven minutes from time but some slack marking from french defender valerien ismael allowed de jong , a recent recruit from ajax , to steal a winner . " ismael is bigger than me but that did n't matter , " said de jong .
" i was desperate to get in front and it was great to score such an important goal . " bremen still behind bremen meanwhile were left to rue not capitalizing on the rare slip from bayern after their draw with leverkusen . torsten frings , one of germany 's stars ridiculed for the 4-1 thrashing by italy in midweek , scored a penalty after three minutes to put bremen in the box seat . bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's paul freier -lrb- right -rrb- struggles for the ball with bremen 's tim borowski but dimitar berbatov equalized on 41 minutes to deny bremen the spoils and keep them eight points adrift of bayern . " it was great to see bayern lose , " said bremen midfielder tim borowski .
" it is just a shame we could not take all the points ourselves . " bremen face italian champions juventus in their last 16 champions league match on tuesday holding a 3-2 cushion from the first leg in germany . as it stands bayern , bremen and hamburg occupy the three allocated champions league slots but schalke 04 remain in the hunt courtesy of a 2-1 win at hannover . schalke are fourth just two points behind hamburg and bremen . podolski saves the day at the opposite end of the table promising striker lukas podolski gave germany coach jürgen klinsmann a timely reminder of his striking talents scoring twice in fc cologne 's 4-2 win at hertha berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski podolski had just four goals to his name this season so the brace will boost his confidence ahead of this summer 's world cup . " criticism is just part of football but i know what i can do and i think i showed that today , " he said . but despite the win cologne remain bottom of the 18-strong bundesliga , five points from safety . on sunday , eintracht frankfurt and vfl wolfsburg tied 1-1 while borussia mönchengladbach beat arminia bielefeld 2-0 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern win like champs after a frustrating champions league draw last week , bayern munich unleashed their offensive prowess against frankfurt .

but even some small and mid-sized firms such as famous pencil-maker faber castello or toymaker playmobil have made their mark internationally .
innovative and tech-savvy , they 've managed to stay one step ahead of the competition and hold on to their leading position in the world market . but that 's not to say all mid-sized german companies are so successful .

around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .

mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there .

but even some small and mid-sized firms such as famous pencil-maker faber castello or toymaker playmobil have made their mark internationally .
innovative and tech-savvy , they 've managed to stay one step ahead of the competition and hold on to their leading position in the world market . but that 's not to say all mid-sized german companies are so successful . " we have the impression that it depends on the size , " said hartmut schauerte , parliamentary state secretary in the german federal ministry for economics .
" the smaller they are the more fearful they are and the bigger they are the more decidedly at home they are in world markets . " backbone of the german economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schauer , ceo of german toymaker playmobil poses with a toy castle medium-sized businesses are often considered the backbone of the german economy .
it 's easy to see why .
around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .
" against that , the 15 eu nations -lrb- before eastward expansion -rrb- are estimated to have had an export average of just 12 percent in 2002 . " rising foreign direct investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german company in saxony manufactures and largely exports beer coasters small german companies export two-thirds of their products to the eu , thus making it its most important market . but it 's not just exports that have skyrocketed ; even direct foreign investments have climbed steadily in the past few years .
mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .
hoping to keep qualified jobs in germany , berlin plans to strongly promote mid-sized firms that are internationally active .
and it 's also stepping up federal financial guarantees for such companies by increasing the yearly budget for it to 2.5 billion euros . schauerte of the german economics ministry is also pinning hopes on so-called cluster building where small companies are encouraged to organize their foreign operations and their sales and distribution sectors together . in addition , the german government also plans to invest more in trade fairs . " we plan to financially support 265 trade fairs and exhibitions abroad , " schauerte said .
" i think we 're world leaders in the field .
it 's important to us that small and mid-sized companies are part of it . " in light of the fact that globalization 's march will continue unhindered , kfw boss reich believes that more and more german mid-sized firms will focus on foreign markets . if mid-sized businesses succeed in continuing to refine their competitiveness through further specialization and investments in innovative products then they would be in a very good position to profit from globalization , he said . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country from hunting to tires , from baking to wires , hundreds of trade fairs in germany cover a wide spectrum of business fields each year .

after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects .

but while some companies are moving production abroad , it 's not necessarily a bad thing for germany .

but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .
nowadays , migratory species such as salmon have not only reappeared but are surviving in the rhine . klaus markgraf-maué a rhine river expert from nabu , a german conservation group , is pleased that even fishermen are coming back . " everyone along the rhine who is engaged in environmental aspects is proud to have them back because it 's a good sign concerning the water quality , " markgraf-maué said . satisfyi n g eu requireme n ts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine , germany 's largest river , needs to be better protected while environmentalists are happy that the rhine is in such good condition and that fish like salmon and shad are returning to its waters , the eu wants further protection for the waterway . in 1992 , lawmakers in brussels passed the flora , fauna , habitat directive , or ffh .
by signing on to the ffh , eu countries promise to preserve and protect natural habitats , including rivers , lakes and streams , within some four million square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 million square miles -rrb- of europe . but deciding what exactly should be protected is a matter of national or local sovereignty .
in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .
" we have marked out a few fish sanctuaries that we believe and that experts also believe to be sufficient and that will protect and sustain the habitats in question . " too little or too much ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is germany 's most important thoroughfares for ships for the time being , the proposal of north rhine-westphalia 's government 's looks set to be approved by the eu .
but it has been criticized by shipping companies on the one hand as being excessive , and on the other by environmentalists who say it does n't go far enough . " the scientific advisors of the eu have hinted that our recommendations will be accepted , " fliege said .
" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals . " it covers only a small part of the habitat , " he said .
" the most important part that is missing the central part of the river , the shipping channel itself , because nowadays we have only parts on both sides , the river banks . " co n crete walls according to conservationists , the situation in the central part of the rhine is where the crux of the problem is .

in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .

" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .

if lawmakers fund the project , germans could resolve unanswered questions within five rather than hundreds of years . west berlin journalist holger kulick often visited the east of the divided city in the 1980s .
after east and west germany were finally reunified , he got the reconstructed dossier compiled on him by east germany 's domestic intelligence service , the stasi , and found out that writer sascha anderson , a close friend in east berlin , had spied on him . " it was painful to read in the reconstituted files that he 'd obviously passed on what i 'd told him in confidence .
that an art professor in dresden was planning a project , and was looking for works by his former students who had left for the west , so that he could put them on exhibition .
and look here , the stasi had the information the very next day , " kulick told dw-tv . the majority of the files recovered after demonstrators stormed the stasi 's buildings in early 1990 had already been shredded . " we 're dealing with very special inventory here , " said günter bormann , a spokesman for the federal stasi files agency .
" these are files that were torn up manually , by hand , in the final weeks of the intelligence service .
so we may conclude that we 're dealing with fairly important documents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi staffers started shredding files when they saw the gdr 's downfall looming since 1995 , the stasi files agency has delivered sacks full of the scraps of paper to a small outpost in zirndorf , bavaria .
the staff there spends their days putting the pieces together .
in 11 years , they 've dealt with the contents of around 300 sacks .
ten pages a day " with one man reconstructing 10 pages a day and a sack holding about 2,500 , you can see how long it will take us before we have dealt with all the sacks still stored in magdeburg .
there 's plenty to do , " said spokesman gerd pfeiffer . there are about 600 million paper scraps in more than 16,000 sacks in storage in magdeburg packed with details of german history .
reconstruction at the present rate will take hundreds of years .
so wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , has called on parliament to agree to fund a pilot project to computerize reconstruction - despite germany 's tight budget position . " the most important principle we anchored into law was making this past accessible - to make this legacy available to the victims , researchers and the german public , " said thierse .
" and the consequence of that decision is that we are obliged to digitally reconstruct these torn-up files . " researchers at berlin 's fraunhofer institute have been testing digital reconstruction for years .
scraps of paper are scanned into a computer and , using recognition criteria like shape , color and typographical details , they are sorted and aligned using special software .
it only takes a few seconds to recreate a page .
experts estimate it would take around five years to reconstruct all the stasi files .
the pilot project would cost about 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- .
interest from abroad police and tax authorities have shown interest in the process , both in germany and abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi sorted the scraps into bags according to room and desk , which makes reconstruction easier " many people are already coming here from abroad , from former communist countries , and also from other former dictatorships : spain , argentina , south africa , " thierse said .
" they want to see how the germans do it , how they deal with their history .
how do they make it possible for people who were victims of dictatorships to understand their own biography ?
how can justice be restored to the victims of dictatorship ? " journalist kulick was one of the first in germany to see his stasi file , painstakingly restored by hand .
without these documents , he would probably never have found out the extent to which his former friend sascha anderson had spied on him . " if it had n't been for these master puzzle-solvers , sascha anderson would probably still be an unsolved mystery , and no one would know exactly what he 's really done , " said kulick . there 's a good chance the bundestag will agree to fund the computer project .

" research and development is in our national interest and iran will not go back on that , " he told a news conference .
" going to the security council will certainly not make iran go back on research and development . " he added that tehran would instead retaliate to such a move by pressing ahead with full-scale uranium enrichment work . international concerns are centered on iran 's bid to master uranium enrichment , even via small-scale research . " we want them to give us time " tehran says it only wants to make reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to the fissile core of a nuclear weapon and the west is determined to prevent iran acquiring this know-how . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani " we want them to treat our case logically , " larijani said of the international atomic energy agency , whose 35-nation board is to begin meeting in vienna on monday .
" we want them to give us time and keep it within the iaea . " larijani said iran was only prepared to hold off on large-scale enrichment . " we are ready to remove concerns and we accept to have a timetable for enrichment , " he said . the united states and the european powers , however , have already said that such a concession does not go far enough and want to see iran halt all work related to enrichment and show greater cooperation with the iaea 's now three-year-old investigation . with security council action likely , western powers have been mulling what pressure - including possible sanctions - could be used against iran if it refuses to return to a moratorium on sensitive nuclear work . using oil to retaliate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could iran turn off its oil pipelines ?
but iran , opec 's second biggest producer , has consistently warned that any sanctions would have worse consequences for the rest of the world . " we have no interest in using oil as a weapon because we respect the psychological security of the international community , " larijani said , repeating iran 's position that it would not initiate such a move . " but naturally if they change the situation that will automatically be affected too , " he warned , ading that " sanctions will not affect us much , and some solutions have been thought about for those which would affect us .

but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .
nowadays , migratory species such as salmon have not only reappeared but are surviving in the rhine . klaus markgraf-maué a rhine river expert from nabu , a german conservation group , is pleased that even fishermen are coming back . " everyone along the rhine who is engaged in environmental aspects is proud to have them back because it 's a good sign concerning the water quality , " markgraf-maué said . satisfyi n g eu requireme n ts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine , germany 's largest river , needs to be better protected while environmentalists are happy that the rhine is in such good condition and that fish like salmon and shad are returning to its waters , the eu wants further protection for the waterway . in 1992 , lawmakers in brussels passed the flora , fauna , habitat directive , or ffh .
by signing on to the ffh , eu countries promise to preserve and protect natural habitats , including rivers , lakes and streams , within some four million square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 million square miles -rrb- of europe . but deciding what exactly should be protected is a matter of national or local sovereignty .
in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .
" we have marked out a few fish sanctuaries that we believe and that experts also believe to be sufficient and that will protect and sustain the habitats in question . " too little or too much ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is germany 's most important thoroughfares for ships for the time being , the proposal of north rhine-westphalia 's government 's looks set to be approved by the eu .
but it has been criticized by shipping companies on the one hand as being excessive , and on the other by environmentalists who say it does n't go far enough . " the scientific advisors of the eu have hinted that our recommendations will be accepted , " fliege said .
" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals . " it covers only a small part of the habitat , " he said .
" the most important part that is missing the central part of the river , the shipping channel itself , because nowadays we have only parts on both sides , the river banks . " co n crete walls according to conservationists , the situation in the central part of the rhine is where the crux of the problem is .
fish species that live on the bottom of the shipping channels will pay the price and lose valuable habitats should the river need to be dredged in the future - and this may be unavoidable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows of cars on a cargo ship on the rhine but even in areas other than the shipping channels , the rhine flows through a man-made straitjacket of embankments and concrete walls , mostly past cities and towns .

in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .

" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.03.2006 more chances than risks in globalization for german business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring to new heights : german toymaker playmobil has made its mark internationally mid-sized german companies are increasingly becoming active in international markets as globalization offers new opportunities and also steps up pressure to compete . think of german companies and the first to spring to mind will probably be giant heavyweights like siemens and mercedes .
but even some small and mid-sized firms such as famous pencil-maker faber castello or toymaker playmobil have made their mark internationally .
innovative and tech-savvy , they 've managed to stay one step ahead of the competition and hold on to their leading position in the world market . but that 's not to say all mid-sized german companies are so successful . " we have the impression that it depends on the size , " said hartmut schauerte , parliamentary state secretary in the german federal ministry for economics .
" the smaller they are the more fearful they are and the bigger they are the more decidedly at home they are in world markets . " backbone of the german economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schauer , ceo of german toymaker playmobil poses with a toy castle medium-sized businesses are often considered the backbone of the german economy .
it 's easy to see why .
around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .
" against that , the 15 eu nations -lrb- before eastward expansion -rrb- are estimated to have had an export average of just 12 percent in 2002 . " rising foreign direct investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german company in saxony manufactures and largely exports beer coasters small german companies export two-thirds of their products to the eu , thus making it its most important market . but it 's not just exports that have skyrocketed ; even direct foreign investments have climbed steadily in the past few years .
mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .
hoping to keep qualified jobs in germany , berlin plans to strongly promote mid-sized firms that are internationally active .
and it 's also stepping up federal financial guarantees for such companies by increasing the yearly budget for it to 2.5 billion euros . schauerte of the german economics ministry is also pinning hopes on so-called cluster building where small companies are encouraged to organize their foreign operations and their sales and distribution sectors together . in addition , the german government also plans to invest more in trade fairs . " we plan to financially support 265 trade fairs and exhibitions abroad , " schauerte said .
" i think we 're world leaders in the field .
it 's important to us that small and mid-sized companies are part of it . " in light of the fact that globalization 's march will continue unhindered , kfw boss reich believes that more and more german mid-sized firms will focus on foreign markets . if mid-sized businesses succeed in continuing to refine their competitiveness through further specialization and investments in innovative products then they would be in a very good position to profit from globalization , he said . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country from hunting to tires , from baking to wires , hundreds of trade fairs in germany cover a wide spectrum of business fields each year .

but even some small and mid-sized firms such as famous pencil-maker faber castello or toymaker playmobil have made their mark internationally .
innovative and tech-savvy , they 've managed to stay one step ahead of the competition and hold on to their leading position in the world market . but that 's not to say all mid-sized german companies are so successful . " we have the impression that it depends on the size , " said hartmut schauerte , parliamentary state secretary in the german federal ministry for economics .
" the smaller they are the more fearful they are and the bigger they are the more decidedly at home they are in world markets . " backbone of the german economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schauer , ceo of german toymaker playmobil poses with a toy castle medium-sized businesses are often considered the backbone of the german economy .
it 's easy to see why .
around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .
" against that , the 15 eu nations -lrb- before eastward expansion -rrb- are estimated to have had an export average of just 12 percent in 2002 . " rising foreign direct investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german company in saxony manufactures and largely exports beer coasters small german companies export two-thirds of their products to the eu , thus making it its most important market . but it 's not just exports that have skyrocketed ; even direct foreign investments have climbed steadily in the past few years .
mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .
hoping to keep qualified jobs in germany , berlin plans to strongly promote mid-sized firms that are internationally active .
and it 's also stepping up federal financial guarantees for such companies by increasing the yearly budget for it to 2.5 billion euros . schauerte of the german economics ministry is also pinning hopes on so-called cluster building where small companies are encouraged to organize their foreign operations and their sales and distribution sectors together . in addition , the german government also plans to invest more in trade fairs . " we plan to financially support 265 trade fairs and exhibitions abroad , " schauerte said .
" i think we 're world leaders in the field .
it 's important to us that small and mid-sized companies are part of it . " in light of the fact that globalization 's march will continue unhindered , kfw boss reich believes that more and more german mid-sized firms will focus on foreign markets . if mid-sized businesses succeed in continuing to refine their competitiveness through further specialization and investments in innovative products then they would be in a very good position to profit from globalization , he said . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country from hunting to tires , from baking to wires , hundreds of trade fairs in germany cover a wide spectrum of business fields each year .

but even some small and mid-sized firms such as famous pencil-maker faber castello or toymaker playmobil have made their mark internationally .

it 's easy to see why .
around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .

mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .
hoping to keep qualified jobs in germany , berlin plans to strongly promote mid-sized firms that are internationally active .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on science europe 's quaero project aims to challenge google freud 's pivotal role in understanding the mind cebit searches for stability new technology promises more humane testing germany -pipe- 05.03.2006 piecing together east german history großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new software could possibly piece together 600 million scraps in five years digital software could speed up the work of reconstructing shredded east german secret police files .
if lawmakers fund the project , germans could resolve unanswered questions within five rather than hundreds of years . west berlin journalist holger kulick often visited the east of the divided city in the 1980s .
after east and west germany were finally reunified , he got the reconstructed dossier compiled on him by east germany 's domestic intelligence service , the stasi , and found out that writer sascha anderson , a close friend in east berlin , had spied on him . " it was painful to read in the reconstituted files that he 'd obviously passed on what i 'd told him in confidence .
that an art professor in dresden was planning a project , and was looking for works by his former students who had left for the west , so that he could put them on exhibition .
and look here , the stasi had the information the very next day , " kulick told dw-tv . the majority of the files recovered after demonstrators stormed the stasi 's buildings in early 1990 had already been shredded . " we 're dealing with very special inventory here , " said günter bormann , a spokesman for the federal stasi files agency .
" these are files that were torn up manually , by hand , in the final weeks of the intelligence service .
so we may conclude that we 're dealing with fairly important documents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi staffers started shredding files when they saw the gdr 's downfall looming since 1995 , the stasi files agency has delivered sacks full of the scraps of paper to a small outpost in zirndorf , bavaria .
the staff there spends their days putting the pieces together .
in 11 years , they 've dealt with the contents of around 300 sacks .
ten pages a day " with one man reconstructing 10 pages a day and a sack holding about 2,500 , you can see how long it will take us before we have dealt with all the sacks still stored in magdeburg .
there 's plenty to do , " said spokesman gerd pfeiffer . there are about 600 million paper scraps in more than 16,000 sacks in storage in magdeburg packed with details of german history .
reconstruction at the present rate will take hundreds of years .
so wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , has called on parliament to agree to fund a pilot project to computerize reconstruction - despite germany 's tight budget position . " the most important principle we anchored into law was making this past accessible - to make this legacy available to the victims , researchers and the german public , " said thierse .
" and the consequence of that decision is that we are obliged to digitally reconstruct these torn-up files . " researchers at berlin 's fraunhofer institute have been testing digital reconstruction for years .
scraps of paper are scanned into a computer and , using recognition criteria like shape , color and typographical details , they are sorted and aligned using special software .
it only takes a few seconds to recreate a page .
experts estimate it would take around five years to reconstruct all the stasi files .
the pilot project would cost about 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- .
interest from abroad police and tax authorities have shown interest in the process , both in germany and abroad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi sorted the scraps into bags according to room and desk , which makes reconstruction easier " many people are already coming here from abroad , from former communist countries , and also from other former dictatorships : spain , argentina , south africa , " thierse said .
" they want to see how the germans do it , how they deal with their history .
how do they make it possible for people who were victims of dictatorships to understand their own biography ?
how can justice be restored to the victims of dictatorship ? " journalist kulick was one of the first in germany to see his stasi file , painstakingly restored by hand .
without these documents , he would probably never have found out the extent to which his former friend sascha anderson had spied on him . " if it had n't been for these master puzzle-solvers , sascha anderson would probably still be an unsolved mystery , and no one would know exactly what he 's really done , " said kulick . there 's a good chance the bundestag will agree to fund the computer project .
and not too soon , since the history-laden contents of the sacks are in danger of deteriorating over time . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long shadow of stasi still darkens aspects of german life despite being disbanded 16 years ago , the legacy of the east german secret police - the stasi - continues to taint people in the public eye .

" we 're dealing with very special inventory here , " said günter bormann , a spokesman for the federal stasi files agency .
" these are files that were torn up manually , by hand , in the final weeks of the intelligence service .

reconstruction at the present rate will take hundreds of years .
so wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , has called on parliament to agree to fund a pilot project to computerize reconstruction - despite germany 's tight budget position . " the most important principle we anchored into law was making this past accessible - to make this legacy available to the victims , researchers and the german public , " said thierse .
" and the consequence of that decision is that we are obliged to digitally reconstruct these torn-up files . " researchers at berlin 's fraunhofer institute have been testing digital reconstruction for years .

but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .
nowadays , migratory species such as salmon have not only reappeared but are surviving in the rhine . klaus markgraf-maué a rhine river expert from nabu , a german conservation group , is pleased that even fishermen are coming back .

by signing on to the ffh , eu countries promise to preserve and protect natural habitats , including rivers , lakes and streams , within some four million square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 million square miles -rrb- of europe . but deciding what exactly should be protected is a matter of national or local sovereignty .
in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .
" we have marked out a few fish sanctuaries that we believe and that experts also believe to be sufficient and that will protect and sustain the habitats in question .

but it has been criticized by shipping companies on the one hand as being excessive , and on the other by environmentalists who say it does n't go far enough . " the scientific advisors of the eu have hinted that our recommendations will be accepted , " fliege said .
" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals . " it covers only a small part of the habitat , " he said .
" the most important part that is missing the central part of the river , the shipping channel itself , because nowadays we have only parts on both sides , the river banks . " co n crete walls according to conservationists , the situation in the central part of the rhine is where the crux of the problem is .

but even some small and mid-sized firms such as famous pencil-maker faber castello or toymaker playmobil have made their mark internationally .
innovative and tech-savvy , they 've managed to stay one step ahead of the competition and hold on to their leading position in the world market . but that 's not to say all mid-sized german companies are so successful . " we have the impression that it depends on the size , " said hartmut schauerte , parliamentary state secretary in the german federal ministry for economics .
" the smaller they are the more fearful they are and the bigger they are the more decidedly at home they are in world markets . " backbone of the german economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schauer , ceo of german toymaker playmobil poses with a toy castle medium-sized businesses are often considered the backbone of the german economy .
it 's easy to see why .
around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .
" against that , the 15 eu nations -lrb- before eastward expansion -rrb- are estimated to have had an export average of just 12 percent in 2002 . " rising foreign direct investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german company in saxony manufactures and largely exports beer coasters small german companies export two-thirds of their products to the eu , thus making it its most important market . but it 's not just exports that have skyrocketed ; even direct foreign investments have climbed steadily in the past few years .
mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .
hoping to keep qualified jobs in germany , berlin plans to strongly promote mid-sized firms that are internationally active .
and it 's also stepping up federal financial guarantees for such companies by increasing the yearly budget for it to 2.5 billion euros . schauerte of the german economics ministry is also pinning hopes on so-called cluster building where small companies are encouraged to organize their foreign operations and their sales and distribution sectors together . in addition , the german government also plans to invest more in trade fairs . " we plan to financially support 265 trade fairs and exhibitions abroad , " schauerte said .
" i think we 're world leaders in the field .
it 's important to us that small and mid-sized companies are part of it . " in light of the fact that globalization 's march will continue unhindered , kfw boss reich believes that more and more german mid-sized firms will focus on foreign markets . if mid-sized businesses succeed in continuing to refine their competitiveness through further specialization and investments in innovative products then they would be in a very good position to profit from globalization , he said . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country from hunting to tires , from baking to wires , hundreds of trade fairs in germany cover a wide spectrum of business fields each year .

by signing on to the ffh , eu countries promise to preserve and protect natural habitats , including rivers , lakes and streams , within some four million square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 million square miles -rrb- of europe . but deciding what exactly should be protected is a matter of national or local sovereignty .
in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .

" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals .

but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .
nowadays , migratory species such as salmon have not only reappeared but are surviving in the rhine . klaus markgraf-maué a rhine river expert from nabu , a german conservation group , is pleased that even fishermen are coming back .

but even some small and mid-sized firms such as famous pencil-maker faber castello or toymaker playmobil have made their mark internationally .
innovative and tech-savvy , they 've managed to stay one step ahead of the competition and hold on to their leading position in the world market . but that 's not to say all mid-sized german companies are so successful . " we have the impression that it depends on the size , " said hartmut schauerte , parliamentary state secretary in the german federal ministry for economics .
" the smaller they are the more fearful they are and the bigger they are the more decidedly at home they are in world markets . " backbone of the german economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schauer , ceo of german toymaker playmobil poses with a toy castle medium-sized businesses are often considered the backbone of the german economy .
it 's easy to see why .
around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .
" against that , the 15 eu nations -lrb- before eastward expansion -rrb- are estimated to have had an export average of just 12 percent in 2002 . " rising foreign direct investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german company in saxony manufactures and largely exports beer coasters small german companies export two-thirds of their products to the eu , thus making it its most important market . but it 's not just exports that have skyrocketed ; even direct foreign investments have climbed steadily in the past few years .
mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .
hoping to keep qualified jobs in germany , berlin plans to strongly promote mid-sized firms that are internationally active .
and it 's also stepping up federal financial guarantees for such companies by increasing the yearly budget for it to 2.5 billion euros . schauerte of the german economics ministry is also pinning hopes on so-called cluster building where small companies are encouraged to organize their foreign operations and their sales and distribution sectors together . in addition , the german government also plans to invest more in trade fairs . " we plan to financially support 265 trade fairs and exhibitions abroad , " schauerte said .
" i think we 're world leaders in the field .
it 's important to us that small and mid-sized companies are part of it . " in light of the fact that globalization 's march will continue unhindered , kfw boss reich believes that more and more german mid-sized firms will focus on foreign markets . if mid-sized businesses succeed in continuing to refine their competitiveness through further specialization and investments in innovative products then they would be in a very good position to profit from globalization , he said . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country from hunting to tires , from baking to wires , hundreds of trade fairs in germany cover a wide spectrum of business fields each year .

" research and development is in our national interest and iran will not go back on that , " he told a news conference .
" going to the security council will certainly not make iran go back on research and development . " he added that tehran would instead retaliate to such a move by pressing ahead with full-scale uranium enrichment work . international concerns are centered on iran 's bid to master uranium enrichment , even via small-scale research . " we want them to give us time " tehran says it only wants to make reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to the fissile core of a nuclear weapon and the west is determined to prevent iran acquiring this know-how . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani " we want them to treat our case logically , " larijani said of the international atomic energy agency , whose 35-nation board is to begin meeting in vienna on monday .
" we want them to give us time and keep it within the iaea . " larijani said iran was only prepared to hold off on large-scale enrichment . " we are ready to remove concerns and we accept to have a timetable for enrichment , " he said . the united states and the european powers , however , have already said that such a concession does not go far enough and want to see iran halt all work related to enrichment and show greater cooperation with the iaea 's now three-year-old investigation . with security council action likely , western powers have been mulling what pressure - including possible sanctions - could be used against iran if it refuses to return to a moratorium on sensitive nuclear work . using oil to retaliate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could iran turn off its oil pipelines ?
but iran , opec 's second biggest producer , has consistently warned that any sanctions would have worse consequences for the rest of the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.03.2006 rejuvenating the rhine river großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is one of germany 's most picturesque waterways a german state plans to earmark a part of the rhine river as a special protection zone to meet eu requirements on preserving the natural habitat .
but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .
nowadays , migratory species such as salmon have not only reappeared but are surviving in the rhine . klaus markgraf-maué a rhine river expert from nabu , a german conservation group , is pleased that even fishermen are coming back . " everyone along the rhine who is engaged in environmental aspects is proud to have them back because it 's a good sign concerning the water quality , " markgraf-maué said . satisfyi n g eu requireme n ts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine , germany 's largest river , needs to be better protected while environmentalists are happy that the rhine is in such good condition and that fish like salmon and shad are returning to its waters , the eu wants further protection for the waterway . in 1992 , lawmakers in brussels passed the flora , fauna , habitat directive , or ffh .
by signing on to the ffh , eu countries promise to preserve and protect natural habitats , including rivers , lakes and streams , within some four million square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 million square miles -rrb- of europe . but deciding what exactly should be protected is a matter of national or local sovereignty .
in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .
" we have marked out a few fish sanctuaries that we believe and that experts also believe to be sufficient and that will protect and sustain the habitats in question . " too little or too much ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is germany 's most important thoroughfares for ships for the time being , the proposal of north rhine-westphalia 's government 's looks set to be approved by the eu .
but it has been criticized by shipping companies on the one hand as being excessive , and on the other by environmentalists who say it does n't go far enough . " the scientific advisors of the eu have hinted that our recommendations will be accepted , " fliege said .
" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals . " it covers only a small part of the habitat , " he said .
" the most important part that is missing the central part of the river , the shipping channel itself , because nowadays we have only parts on both sides , the river banks . " co n crete walls according to conservationists , the situation in the central part of the rhine is where the crux of the problem is .
fish species that live on the bottom of the shipping channels will pay the price and lose valuable habitats should the river need to be dredged in the future - and this may be unavoidable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows of cars on a cargo ship on the rhine but even in areas other than the shipping channels , the rhine flows through a man-made straitjacket of embankments and concrete walls , mostly past cities and towns .
and it 's the areas where these walls are of little use that should be given priority . " the goal of our project , ' living rhine , ' is to put concrete out of the bank and to have more space for dynamics along the river , " markgraf-maué said . john kluempers -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says german forests are ailing german forests , immortalized by goethe in poems , are far removed from their image of robust health .

" we are ready to remove concerns and we accept to have a timetable for enrichment , " he said . the united states and the european powers , however , have already said that such a concession does not go far enough and want to see iran halt all work related to enrichment and show greater cooperation with the iaea 's now three-year-old investigation . with security council action likely , western powers have been mulling what pressure - including possible sanctions - could be used against iran if it refuses to return to a moratorium on sensitive nuclear work . using oil to retaliate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could iran turn off its oil pipelines ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.03.2006 more chances than risks in globalization for german business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring to new heights : german toymaker playmobil has made its mark internationally mid-sized german companies are increasingly becoming active in international markets as globalization offers new opportunities and also steps up pressure to compete . think of german companies and the first to spring to mind will probably be giant heavyweights like siemens and mercedes .
but even some small and mid-sized firms such as famous pencil-maker faber castello or toymaker playmobil have made their mark internationally .
innovative and tech-savvy , they 've managed to stay one step ahead of the competition and hold on to their leading position in the world market . but that 's not to say all mid-sized german companies are so successful . " we have the impression that it depends on the size , " said hartmut schauerte , parliamentary state secretary in the german federal ministry for economics .
" the smaller they are the more fearful they are and the bigger they are the more decidedly at home they are in world markets . " backbone of the german economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schauer , ceo of german toymaker playmobil poses with a toy castle medium-sized businesses are often considered the backbone of the german economy .
it 's easy to see why .
around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .
" against that , the 15 eu nations -lrb- before eastward expansion -rrb- are estimated to have had an export average of just 12 percent in 2002 . " rising foreign direct investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german company in saxony manufactures and largely exports beer coasters small german companies export two-thirds of their products to the eu , thus making it its most important market . but it 's not just exports that have skyrocketed ; even direct foreign investments have climbed steadily in the past few years .
mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .
hoping to keep qualified jobs in germany , berlin plans to strongly promote mid-sized firms that are internationally active .
and it 's also stepping up federal financial guarantees for such companies by increasing the yearly budget for it to 2.5 billion euros . schauerte of the german economics ministry is also pinning hopes on so-called cluster building where small companies are encouraged to organize their foreign operations and their sales and distribution sectors together . in addition , the german government also plans to invest more in trade fairs . " we plan to financially support 265 trade fairs and exhibitions abroad , " schauerte said .
" i think we 're world leaders in the field .
it 's important to us that small and mid-sized companies are part of it . " in light of the fact that globalization 's march will continue unhindered , kfw boss reich believes that more and more german mid-sized firms will focus on foreign markets . if mid-sized businesses succeed in continuing to refine their competitiveness through further specialization and investments in innovative products then they would be in a very good position to profit from globalization , he said . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country from hunting to tires , from baking to wires , hundreds of trade fairs in germany cover a wide spectrum of business fields each year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.03.2006 rejuvenating the rhine river großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is one of germany 's most picturesque waterways a german state plans to earmark a part of the rhine river as a special protection zone to meet eu requirements on preserving the natural habitat .
but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .
nowadays , migratory species such as salmon have not only reappeared but are surviving in the rhine . klaus markgraf-maué a rhine river expert from nabu , a german conservation group , is pleased that even fishermen are coming back . " everyone along the rhine who is engaged in environmental aspects is proud to have them back because it 's a good sign concerning the water quality , " markgraf-maué said . satisfyi n g eu requireme n ts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine , germany 's largest river , needs to be better protected while environmentalists are happy that the rhine is in such good condition and that fish like salmon and shad are returning to its waters , the eu wants further protection for the waterway . in 1992 , lawmakers in brussels passed the flora , fauna , habitat directive , or ffh .
by signing on to the ffh , eu countries promise to preserve and protect natural habitats , including rivers , lakes and streams , within some four million square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 million square miles -rrb- of europe . but deciding what exactly should be protected is a matter of national or local sovereignty .
in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .
" we have marked out a few fish sanctuaries that we believe and that experts also believe to be sufficient and that will protect and sustain the habitats in question . " too little or too much ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is germany 's most important thoroughfares for ships for the time being , the proposal of north rhine-westphalia 's government 's looks set to be approved by the eu .
but it has been criticized by shipping companies on the one hand as being excessive , and on the other by environmentalists who say it does n't go far enough . " the scientific advisors of the eu have hinted that our recommendations will be accepted , " fliege said .
" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals . " it covers only a small part of the habitat , " he said .
" the most important part that is missing the central part of the river , the shipping channel itself , because nowadays we have only parts on both sides , the river banks . " co n crete walls according to conservationists , the situation in the central part of the rhine is where the crux of the problem is .
fish species that live on the bottom of the shipping channels will pay the price and lose valuable habitats should the river need to be dredged in the future - and this may be unavoidable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows of cars on a cargo ship on the rhine but even in areas other than the shipping channels , the rhine flows through a man-made straitjacket of embankments and concrete walls , mostly past cities and towns .
and it 's the areas where these walls are of little use that should be given priority . " the goal of our project , ' living rhine , ' is to put concrete out of the bank and to have more space for dynamics along the river , " markgraf-maué said . john kluempers -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says german forests are ailing german forests , immortalized by goethe in poems , are far removed from their image of robust health .

" research and development is in our national interest and iran will not go back on that , " he told a news conference .
" going to the security council will certainly not make iran go back on research and development . " he added that tehran would instead retaliate to such a move by pressing ahead with full-scale uranium enrichment work . international concerns are centered on iran 's bid to master uranium enrichment , even via small-scale research . " we want them to give us time " tehran says it only wants to make reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to the fissile core of a nuclear weapon and the west is determined to prevent iran acquiring this know-how . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani " we want them to treat our case logically , " larijani said of the international atomic energy agency , whose 35-nation board is to begin meeting in vienna on monday .
" we want them to give us time and keep it within the iaea . " larijani said iran was only prepared to hold off on large-scale enrichment . " we are ready to remove concerns and we accept to have a timetable for enrichment , " he said . the united states and the european powers , however , have already said that such a concession does not go far enough and want to see iran halt all work related to enrichment and show greater cooperation with the iaea 's now three-year-old investigation . with security council action likely , western powers have been mulling what pressure - including possible sanctions - could be used against iran if it refuses to return to a moratorium on sensitive nuclear work . using oil to retaliate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could iran turn off its oil pipelines ?
but iran , opec 's second biggest producer , has consistently warned that any sanctions would have worse consequences for the rest of the world . " we have no interest in using oil as a weapon because we respect the psychological security of the international community , " larijani said , repeating iran 's position that it would not initiate such a move . " but naturally if they change the situation that will automatically be affected too , " he warned , ading that " sanctions will not affect us much , and some solutions have been thought about for those which would affect us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.03.2006 rejuvenating the rhine river großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is one of germany 's most picturesque waterways a german state plans to earmark a part of the rhine river as a special protection zone to meet eu requirements on preserving the natural habitat .
but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .
nowadays , migratory species such as salmon have not only reappeared but are surviving in the rhine . klaus markgraf-maué a rhine river expert from nabu , a german conservation group , is pleased that even fishermen are coming back . " everyone along the rhine who is engaged in environmental aspects is proud to have them back because it 's a good sign concerning the water quality , " markgraf-maué said . satisfyi n g eu requireme n ts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine , germany 's largest river , needs to be better protected while environmentalists are happy that the rhine is in such good condition and that fish like salmon and shad are returning to its waters , the eu wants further protection for the waterway . in 1992 , lawmakers in brussels passed the flora , fauna , habitat directive , or ffh .
by signing on to the ffh , eu countries promise to preserve and protect natural habitats , including rivers , lakes and streams , within some four million square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 million square miles -rrb- of europe . but deciding what exactly should be protected is a matter of national or local sovereignty .
in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .
" we have marked out a few fish sanctuaries that we believe and that experts also believe to be sufficient and that will protect and sustain the habitats in question . " too little or too much ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is germany 's most important thoroughfares for ships for the time being , the proposal of north rhine-westphalia 's government 's looks set to be approved by the eu .
but it has been criticized by shipping companies on the one hand as being excessive , and on the other by environmentalists who say it does n't go far enough . " the scientific advisors of the eu have hinted that our recommendations will be accepted , " fliege said .
" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals . " it covers only a small part of the habitat , " he said .
" the most important part that is missing the central part of the river , the shipping channel itself , because nowadays we have only parts on both sides , the river banks . " co n crete walls according to conservationists , the situation in the central part of the rhine is where the crux of the problem is .
fish species that live on the bottom of the shipping channels will pay the price and lose valuable habitats should the river need to be dredged in the future - and this may be unavoidable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows of cars on a cargo ship on the rhine but even in areas other than the shipping channels , the rhine flows through a man-made straitjacket of embankments and concrete walls , mostly past cities and towns .
and it 's the areas where these walls are of little use that should be given priority . " the goal of our project , ' living rhine , ' is to put concrete out of the bank and to have more space for dynamics along the river , " markgraf-maué said . john kluempers -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says german forests are ailing german forests , immortalized by goethe in poems , are far removed from their image of robust health .

but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .
nowadays , migratory species such as salmon have not only reappeared but are surviving in the rhine . klaus markgraf-maué a rhine river expert from nabu , a german conservation group , is pleased that even fishermen are coming back . " everyone along the rhine who is engaged in environmental aspects is proud to have them back because it 's a good sign concerning the water quality , " markgraf-maué said . satisfyi n g eu requireme n ts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine , germany 's largest river , needs to be better protected while environmentalists are happy that the rhine is in such good condition and that fish like salmon and shad are returning to its waters , the eu wants further protection for the waterway . in 1992 , lawmakers in brussels passed the flora , fauna , habitat directive , or ffh .
by signing on to the ffh , eu countries promise to preserve and protect natural habitats , including rivers , lakes and streams , within some four million square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 million square miles -rrb- of europe . but deciding what exactly should be protected is a matter of national or local sovereignty .
in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .
" we have marked out a few fish sanctuaries that we believe and that experts also believe to be sufficient and that will protect and sustain the habitats in question . " too little or too much ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is germany 's most important thoroughfares for ships for the time being , the proposal of north rhine-westphalia 's government 's looks set to be approved by the eu .
but it has been criticized by shipping companies on the one hand as being excessive , and on the other by environmentalists who say it does n't go far enough . " the scientific advisors of the eu have hinted that our recommendations will be accepted , " fliege said .
" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals . " it covers only a small part of the habitat , " he said .
" the most important part that is missing the central part of the river , the shipping channel itself , because nowadays we have only parts on both sides , the river banks . " co n crete walls according to conservationists , the situation in the central part of the rhine is where the crux of the problem is .
fish species that live on the bottom of the shipping channels will pay the price and lose valuable habitats should the river need to be dredged in the future - and this may be unavoidable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows of cars on a cargo ship on the rhine but even in areas other than the shipping channels , the rhine flows through a man-made straitjacket of embankments and concrete walls , mostly past cities and towns .
and it 's the areas where these walls are of little use that should be given priority . " the goal of our project , ' living rhine , ' is to put concrete out of the bank and to have more space for dynamics along the river , " markgraf-maué said . john kluempers -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says german forests are ailing german forests , immortalized by goethe in poems , are far removed from their image of robust health .

" we had the draw which would have been fine but we wanted more .
the team needs to understand that we are playing for the german title here not some local championship . " it was hamburg 's second victory over bayern this season having won 2-0 in september . untimely defeat for bayern the defeat was untimely with a crucial champions league showdown at ac milan to come on wednesday . milan have a slight edge after scoring a priceless away goal in the 1-1 first leg stalemate in munich . " we were too passive and not aggressive enough , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" we have a big game against milan coming up but that is no excuse . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's dutch rafael van der vaart -lrb- right -rrb- and munich 's martin demichelis on saturday kahn was missing from the first match with milan through a thigh injury and his return against hamburg was far from smooth . predicting a cross from cote d 'ivoire international guy demel , kahn dived accross the penalty area but demel curled the ball straight in for a 16th minute lead . scholl looked to have saved bayern seven minutes from time but some slack marking from french defender valerien ismael allowed de jong , a recent recruit from ajax , to steal a winner . " ismael is bigger than me but that did n't matter , " said de jong .
" i was desperate to get in front and it was great to score such an important goal . " bremen still behind bremen meanwhile were left to rue not capitalizing on the rare slip from bayern after their draw with leverkusen . torsten frings , one of germany 's stars ridiculed for the 4-1 thrashing by italy in midweek , scored a penalty after three minutes to put bremen in the box seat . bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's paul freier -lrb- right -rrb- struggles for the ball with bremen 's tim borowski but dimitar berbatov equalized on 41 minutes to deny bremen the spoils and keep them eight points adrift of bayern . " it was great to see bayern lose , " said bremen midfielder tim borowski .
" it is just a shame we could not take all the points ourselves . " bremen face italian champions juventus in their last 16 champions league match on tuesday holding a 3-2 cushion from the first leg in germany . as it stands bayern , bremen and hamburg occupy the three allocated champions league slots but schalke 04 remain in the hunt courtesy of a 2-1 win at hannover . schalke are fourth just two points behind hamburg and bremen . podolski saves the day at the opposite end of the table promising striker lukas podolski gave germany coach jürgen klinsmann a timely reminder of his striking talents scoring twice in fc cologne 's 4-2 win at hertha berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski podolski had just four goals to his name this season so the brace will boost his confidence ahead of this summer 's world cup . " criticism is just part of football but i know what i can do and i think i showed that today , " he said . but despite the win cologne remain bottom of the 18-strong bundesliga , five points from safety . on sunday , eintracht frankfurt and vfl wolfsburg tied 1-1 while borussia mönchengladbach beat arminia bielefeld 2-0 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern win like champs after a frustrating champions league draw last week , bayern munich unleashed their offensive prowess against frankfurt .

but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .
nowadays , migratory species such as salmon have not only reappeared but are surviving in the rhine . klaus markgraf-maué a rhine river expert from nabu , a german conservation group , is pleased that even fishermen are coming back . " everyone along the rhine who is engaged in environmental aspects is proud to have them back because it 's a good sign concerning the water quality , " markgraf-maué said . satisfyi n g eu requireme n ts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine , germany 's largest river , needs to be better protected while environmentalists are happy that the rhine is in such good condition and that fish like salmon and shad are returning to its waters , the eu wants further protection for the waterway . in 1992 , lawmakers in brussels passed the flora , fauna , habitat directive , or ffh .
by signing on to the ffh , eu countries promise to preserve and protect natural habitats , including rivers , lakes and streams , within some four million square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 million square miles -rrb- of europe . but deciding what exactly should be protected is a matter of national or local sovereignty .
in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .
" we have marked out a few fish sanctuaries that we believe and that experts also believe to be sufficient and that will protect and sustain the habitats in question . " too little or too much ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is germany 's most important thoroughfares for ships for the time being , the proposal of north rhine-westphalia 's government 's looks set to be approved by the eu .
but it has been criticized by shipping companies on the one hand as being excessive , and on the other by environmentalists who say it does n't go far enough . " the scientific advisors of the eu have hinted that our recommendations will be accepted , " fliege said .
" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals . " it covers only a small part of the habitat , " he said .
" the most important part that is missing the central part of the river , the shipping channel itself , because nowadays we have only parts on both sides , the river banks . " co n crete walls according to conservationists , the situation in the central part of the rhine is where the crux of the problem is .
fish species that live on the bottom of the shipping channels will pay the price and lose valuable habitats should the river need to be dredged in the future - and this may be unavoidable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows of cars on a cargo ship on the rhine but even in areas other than the shipping channels , the rhine flows through a man-made straitjacket of embankments and concrete walls , mostly past cities and towns .

but even some small and mid-sized firms such as famous pencil-maker faber castello or toymaker playmobil have made their mark internationally .
innovative and tech-savvy , they 've managed to stay one step ahead of the competition and hold on to their leading position in the world market . but that 's not to say all mid-sized german companies are so successful . " we have the impression that it depends on the size , " said hartmut schauerte , parliamentary state secretary in the german federal ministry for economics .

it 's easy to see why .
around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .

mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .
hoping to keep qualified jobs in germany , berlin plans to strongly promote mid-sized firms that are internationally active .

but even some small and mid-sized firms such as famous pencil-maker faber castello or toymaker playmobil have made their mark internationally .
innovative and tech-savvy , they 've managed to stay one step ahead of the competition and hold on to their leading position in the world market . but that 's not to say all mid-sized german companies are so successful . " we have the impression that it depends on the size , " said hartmut schauerte , parliamentary state secretary in the german federal ministry for economics .
" the smaller they are the more fearful they are and the bigger they are the more decidedly at home they are in world markets . " backbone of the german economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schauer , ceo of german toymaker playmobil poses with a toy castle medium-sized businesses are often considered the backbone of the german economy .
it 's easy to see why .
around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .
" against that , the 15 eu nations -lrb- before eastward expansion -rrb- are estimated to have had an export average of just 12 percent in 2002 . " rising foreign direct investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german company in saxony manufactures and largely exports beer coasters small german companies export two-thirds of their products to the eu , thus making it its most important market . but it 's not just exports that have skyrocketed ; even direct foreign investments have climbed steadily in the past few years .
mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .
hoping to keep qualified jobs in germany , berlin plans to strongly promote mid-sized firms that are internationally active .
and it 's also stepping up federal financial guarantees for such companies by increasing the yearly budget for it to 2.5 billion euros . schauerte of the german economics ministry is also pinning hopes on so-called cluster building where small companies are encouraged to organize their foreign operations and their sales and distribution sectors together . in addition , the german government also plans to invest more in trade fairs . " we plan to financially support 265 trade fairs and exhibitions abroad , " schauerte said .
" i think we 're world leaders in the field .
it 's important to us that small and mid-sized companies are part of it . " in light of the fact that globalization 's march will continue unhindered , kfw boss reich believes that more and more german mid-sized firms will focus on foreign markets . if mid-sized businesses succeed in continuing to refine their competitiveness through further specialization and investments in innovative products then they would be in a very good position to profit from globalization , he said . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country from hunting to tires , from baking to wires , hundreds of trade fairs in germany cover a wide spectrum of business fields each year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.03.2006 rejuvenating the rhine river großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is one of germany 's most picturesque waterways a german state plans to earmark a part of the rhine river as a special protection zone to meet eu requirements on preserving the natural habitat .
but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .
nowadays , migratory species such as salmon have not only reappeared but are surviving in the rhine . klaus markgraf-maué a rhine river expert from nabu , a german conservation group , is pleased that even fishermen are coming back . " everyone along the rhine who is engaged in environmental aspects is proud to have them back because it 's a good sign concerning the water quality , " markgraf-maué said . satisfyi n g eu requireme n ts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine , germany 's largest river , needs to be better protected while environmentalists are happy that the rhine is in such good condition and that fish like salmon and shad are returning to its waters , the eu wants further protection for the waterway . in 1992 , lawmakers in brussels passed the flora , fauna , habitat directive , or ffh .
by signing on to the ffh , eu countries promise to preserve and protect natural habitats , including rivers , lakes and streams , within some four million square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 million square miles -rrb- of europe . but deciding what exactly should be protected is a matter of national or local sovereignty .
in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .
" we have marked out a few fish sanctuaries that we believe and that experts also believe to be sufficient and that will protect and sustain the habitats in question . " too little or too much ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is germany 's most important thoroughfares for ships for the time being , the proposal of north rhine-westphalia 's government 's looks set to be approved by the eu .
but it has been criticized by shipping companies on the one hand as being excessive , and on the other by environmentalists who say it does n't go far enough . " the scientific advisors of the eu have hinted that our recommendations will be accepted , " fliege said .
" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals . " it covers only a small part of the habitat , " he said .
" the most important part that is missing the central part of the river , the shipping channel itself , because nowadays we have only parts on both sides , the river banks . " co n crete walls according to conservationists , the situation in the central part of the rhine is where the crux of the problem is .
fish species that live on the bottom of the shipping channels will pay the price and lose valuable habitats should the river need to be dredged in the future - and this may be unavoidable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows of cars on a cargo ship on the rhine but even in areas other than the shipping channels , the rhine flows through a man-made straitjacket of embankments and concrete walls , mostly past cities and towns .
and it 's the areas where these walls are of little use that should be given priority . " the goal of our project , ' living rhine , ' is to put concrete out of the bank and to have more space for dynamics along the river , " markgraf-maué said . john kluempers -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says german forests are ailing german forests , immortalized by goethe in poems , are far removed from their image of robust health .

around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .
" against that , the 15 eu nations -lrb- before eastward expansion -rrb- are estimated to have had an export average of just 12 percent in 2002 .

mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .
hoping to keep qualified jobs in germany , berlin plans to strongly promote mid-sized firms that are internationally active .
and it 's also stepping up federal financial guarantees for such companies by increasing the yearly budget for it to 2.5 billion euros . schauerte of the german economics ministry is also pinning hopes on so-called cluster building where small companies are encouraged to organize their foreign operations and their sales and distribution sectors together . in addition , the german government also plans to invest more in trade fairs . " we plan to financially support 265 trade fairs and exhibitions abroad , " schauerte said .
" i think we 're world leaders in the field .
it 's important to us that small and mid-sized companies are part of it . " in light of the fact that globalization 's march will continue unhindered , kfw boss reich believes that more and more german mid-sized firms will focus on foreign markets . if mid-sized businesses succeed in continuing to refine their competitiveness through further specialization and investments in innovative products then they would be in a very good position to profit from globalization , he said . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country from hunting to tires , from baking to wires , hundreds of trade fairs in germany cover a wide spectrum of business fields each year .

but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .
nowadays , migratory species such as salmon have not only reappeared but are surviving in the rhine . klaus markgraf-maué a rhine river expert from nabu , a german conservation group , is pleased that even fishermen are coming back .

by signing on to the ffh , eu countries promise to preserve and protect natural habitats , including rivers , lakes and streams , within some four million square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 million square miles -rrb- of europe . but deciding what exactly should be protected is a matter of national or local sovereignty .
in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .
" we have marked out a few fish sanctuaries that we believe and that experts also believe to be sufficient and that will protect and sustain the habitats in question .

but it has been criticized by shipping companies on the one hand as being excessive , and on the other by environmentalists who say it does n't go far enough . " the scientific advisors of the eu have hinted that our recommendations will be accepted , " fliege said .
" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals . " it covers only a small part of the habitat , " he said .
" the most important part that is missing the central part of the river , the shipping channel itself , because nowadays we have only parts on both sides , the river banks . " co n crete walls according to conservationists , the situation in the central part of the rhine is where the crux of the problem is .

" research and development is in our national interest and iran will not go back on that , " he told a news conference .
" going to the security council will certainly not make iran go back on research and development . " he added that tehran would instead retaliate to such a move by pressing ahead with full-scale uranium enrichment work . international concerns are centered on iran 's bid to master uranium enrichment , even via small-scale research . " we want them to give us time " tehran says it only wants to make reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to the fissile core of a nuclear weapon and the west is determined to prevent iran acquiring this know-how . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani " we want them to treat our case logically , " larijani said of the international atomic energy agency , whose 35-nation board is to begin meeting in vienna on monday .
" we want them to give us time and keep it within the iaea . " larijani said iran was only prepared to hold off on large-scale enrichment . " we are ready to remove concerns and we accept to have a timetable for enrichment , " he said . the united states and the european powers , however , have already said that such a concession does not go far enough and want to see iran halt all work related to enrichment and show greater cooperation with the iaea 's now three-year-old investigation . with security council action likely , western powers have been mulling what pressure - including possible sanctions - could be used against iran if it refuses to return to a moratorium on sensitive nuclear work . using oil to retaliate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could iran turn off its oil pipelines ?
but iran , opec 's second biggest producer , has consistently warned that any sanctions would have worse consequences for the rest of the world .

" we had the draw which would have been fine but we wanted more .
the team needs to understand that we are playing for the german title here not some local championship . " it was hamburg 's second victory over bayern this season having won 2-0 in september . untimely defeat for bayern the defeat was untimely with a crucial champions league showdown at ac milan to come on wednesday . milan have a slight edge after scoring a priceless away goal in the 1-1 first leg stalemate in munich . " we were too passive and not aggressive enough , " said bayern coach felix magath .
" we have a big game against milan coming up but that is no excuse . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's dutch rafael van der vaart -lrb- right -rrb- and munich 's martin demichelis on saturday kahn was missing from the first match with milan through a thigh injury and his return against hamburg was far from smooth . predicting a cross from cote d 'ivoire international guy demel , kahn dived accross the penalty area but demel curled the ball straight in for a 16th minute lead . scholl looked to have saved bayern seven minutes from time but some slack marking from french defender valerien ismael allowed de jong , a recent recruit from ajax , to steal a winner . " ismael is bigger than me but that did n't matter , " said de jong .
" i was desperate to get in front and it was great to score such an important goal . " bremen still behind bremen meanwhile were left to rue not capitalizing on the rare slip from bayern after their draw with leverkusen . torsten frings , one of germany 's stars ridiculed for the 4-1 thrashing by italy in midweek , scored a penalty after three minutes to put bremen in the box seat . bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's paul freier -lrb- right -rrb- struggles for the ball with bremen 's tim borowski but dimitar berbatov equalized on 41 minutes to deny bremen the spoils and keep them eight points adrift of bayern . " it was great to see bayern lose , " said bremen midfielder tim borowski .
" it is just a shame we could not take all the points ourselves . " bremen face italian champions juventus in their last 16 champions league match on tuesday holding a 3-2 cushion from the first leg in germany . as it stands bayern , bremen and hamburg occupy the three allocated champions league slots but schalke 04 remain in the hunt courtesy of a 2-1 win at hannover . schalke are fourth just two points behind hamburg and bremen . podolski saves the day at the opposite end of the table promising striker lukas podolski gave germany coach jürgen klinsmann a timely reminder of his striking talents scoring twice in fc cologne 's 4-2 win at hertha berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski podolski had just four goals to his name this season so the brace will boost his confidence ahead of this summer 's world cup . " criticism is just part of football but i know what i can do and i think i showed that today , " he said . but despite the win cologne remain bottom of the 18-strong bundesliga , five points from safety . on sunday , eintracht frankfurt and vfl wolfsburg tied 1-1 while borussia mönchengladbach beat arminia bielefeld 2-0 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern win like champs after a frustrating champions league draw last week , bayern munich unleashed their offensive prowess against frankfurt .

around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .

mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .

but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .
nowadays , migratory species such as salmon have not only reappeared but are surviving in the rhine . klaus markgraf-maué a rhine river expert from nabu , a german conservation group , is pleased that even fishermen are coming back . " everyone along the rhine who is engaged in environmental aspects is proud to have them back because it 's a good sign concerning the water quality , " markgraf-maué said . satisfyi n g eu requireme n ts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine , germany 's largest river , needs to be better protected while environmentalists are happy that the rhine is in such good condition and that fish like salmon and shad are returning to its waters , the eu wants further protection for the waterway . in 1992 , lawmakers in brussels passed the flora , fauna , habitat directive , or ffh .
by signing on to the ffh , eu countries promise to preserve and protect natural habitats , including rivers , lakes and streams , within some four million square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 million square miles -rrb- of europe . but deciding what exactly should be protected is a matter of national or local sovereignty .
in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .
" we have marked out a few fish sanctuaries that we believe and that experts also believe to be sufficient and that will protect and sustain the habitats in question . " too little or too much ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is germany 's most important thoroughfares for ships for the time being , the proposal of north rhine-westphalia 's government 's looks set to be approved by the eu .
but it has been criticized by shipping companies on the one hand as being excessive , and on the other by environmentalists who say it does n't go far enough . " the scientific advisors of the eu have hinted that our recommendations will be accepted , " fliege said .
" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals . " it covers only a small part of the habitat , " he said .
" the most important part that is missing the central part of the river , the shipping channel itself , because nowadays we have only parts on both sides , the river banks . " co n crete walls according to conservationists , the situation in the central part of the rhine is where the crux of the problem is .
fish species that live on the bottom of the shipping channels will pay the price and lose valuable habitats should the river need to be dredged in the future - and this may be unavoidable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows of cars on a cargo ship on the rhine but even in areas other than the shipping channels , the rhine flows through a man-made straitjacket of embankments and concrete walls , mostly past cities and towns .
and it 's the areas where these walls are of little use that should be given priority . " the goal of our project , ' living rhine , ' is to put concrete out of the bank and to have more space for dynamics along the river , " markgraf-maué said . john kluempers -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says german forests are ailing german forests , immortalized by goethe in poems , are far removed from their image of robust health .

" research and development is in our national interest and iran will not go back on that , " he told a news conference .
" going to the security council will certainly not make iran go back on research and development . " he added that tehran would instead retaliate to such a move by pressing ahead with full-scale uranium enrichment work . international concerns are centered on iran 's bid to master uranium enrichment , even via small-scale research . " we want them to give us time " tehran says it only wants to make reactor fuel , but the process can be extended to the fissile core of a nuclear weapon and the west is determined to prevent iran acquiring this know-how . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali larijani " we want them to treat our case logically , " larijani said of the international atomic energy agency , whose 35-nation board is to begin meeting in vienna on monday .
" we want them to give us time and keep it within the iaea . " larijani said iran was only prepared to hold off on large-scale enrichment . " we are ready to remove concerns and we accept to have a timetable for enrichment , " he said . the united states and the european powers , however , have already said that such a concession does not go far enough and want to see iran halt all work related to enrichment and show greater cooperation with the iaea 's now three-year-old investigation . with security council action likely , western powers have been mulling what pressure - including possible sanctions - could be used against iran if it refuses to return to a moratorium on sensitive nuclear work . using oil to retaliate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could iran turn off its oil pipelines ?
but iran , opec 's second biggest producer , has consistently warned that any sanctions would have worse consequences for the rest of the world . " we have no interest in using oil as a weapon because we respect the psychological security of the international community , " larijani said , repeating iran 's position that it would not initiate such a move . " but naturally if they change the situation that will automatically be affected too , " he warned , ading that " sanctions will not affect us much , and some solutions have been thought about for those which would affect us .

but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .

the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .

" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.03.2006 more chances than risks in globalization for german business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring to new heights : german toymaker playmobil has made its mark internationally mid-sized german companies are increasingly becoming active in international markets as globalization offers new opportunities and also steps up pressure to compete . think of german companies and the first to spring to mind will probably be giant heavyweights like siemens and mercedes .
but even some small and mid-sized firms such as famous pencil-maker faber castello or toymaker playmobil have made their mark internationally .
innovative and tech-savvy , they 've managed to stay one step ahead of the competition and hold on to their leading position in the world market . but that 's not to say all mid-sized german companies are so successful . " we have the impression that it depends on the size , " said hartmut schauerte , parliamentary state secretary in the german federal ministry for economics .
" the smaller they are the more fearful they are and the bigger they are the more decidedly at home they are in world markets . " backbone of the german economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schauer , ceo of german toymaker playmobil poses with a toy castle medium-sized businesses are often considered the backbone of the german economy .
it 's easy to see why .
around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .
" against that , the 15 eu nations -lrb- before eastward expansion -rrb- are estimated to have had an export average of just 12 percent in 2002 . " rising foreign direct investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german company in saxony manufactures and largely exports beer coasters small german companies export two-thirds of their products to the eu , thus making it its most important market . but it 's not just exports that have skyrocketed ; even direct foreign investments have climbed steadily in the past few years .
mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .
hoping to keep qualified jobs in germany , berlin plans to strongly promote mid-sized firms that are internationally active .
and it 's also stepping up federal financial guarantees for such companies by increasing the yearly budget for it to 2.5 billion euros . schauerte of the german economics ministry is also pinning hopes on so-called cluster building where small companies are encouraged to organize their foreign operations and their sales and distribution sectors together . in addition , the german government also plans to invest more in trade fairs . " we plan to financially support 265 trade fairs and exhibitions abroad , " schauerte said .
" i think we 're world leaders in the field .
it 's important to us that small and mid-sized companies are part of it . " in light of the fact that globalization 's march will continue unhindered , kfw boss reich believes that more and more german mid-sized firms will focus on foreign markets . if mid-sized businesses succeed in continuing to refine their competitiveness through further specialization and investments in innovative products then they would be in a very good position to profit from globalization , he said . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country from hunting to tires , from baking to wires , hundreds of trade fairs in germany cover a wide spectrum of business fields each year .

but even some small and mid-sized firms such as famous pencil-maker faber castello or toymaker playmobil have made their mark internationally .
innovative and tech-savvy , they 've managed to stay one step ahead of the competition and hold on to their leading position in the world market . but that 's not to say all mid-sized german companies are so successful .

it 's easy to see why .
around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .

mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .

" i think we 're world leaders in the field .
it 's important to us that small and mid-sized companies are part of it .

but even some small and mid-sized firms such as famous pencil-maker faber castello or toymaker playmobil have made their mark internationally .
innovative and tech-savvy , they 've managed to stay one step ahead of the competition and hold on to their leading position in the world market . but that 's not to say all mid-sized german companies are so successful . " we have the impression that it depends on the size , " said hartmut schauerte , parliamentary state secretary in the german federal ministry for economics .
" the smaller they are the more fearful they are and the bigger they are the more decidedly at home they are in world markets . " backbone of the german economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schauer , ceo of german toymaker playmobil poses with a toy castle medium-sized businesses are often considered the backbone of the german economy .
it 's easy to see why .
around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .
" against that , the 15 eu nations -lrb- before eastward expansion -rrb- are estimated to have had an export average of just 12 percent in 2002 . " rising foreign direct investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german company in saxony manufactures and largely exports beer coasters small german companies export two-thirds of their products to the eu , thus making it its most important market . but it 's not just exports that have skyrocketed ; even direct foreign investments have climbed steadily in the past few years .
mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .
hoping to keep qualified jobs in germany , berlin plans to strongly promote mid-sized firms that are internationally active .
and it 's also stepping up federal financial guarantees for such companies by increasing the yearly budget for it to 2.5 billion euros . schauerte of the german economics ministry is also pinning hopes on so-called cluster building where small companies are encouraged to organize their foreign operations and their sales and distribution sectors together . in addition , the german government also plans to invest more in trade fairs . " we plan to financially support 265 trade fairs and exhibitions abroad , " schauerte said .
" i think we 're world leaders in the field .
it 's important to us that small and mid-sized companies are part of it . " in light of the fact that globalization 's march will continue unhindered , kfw boss reich believes that more and more german mid-sized firms will focus on foreign markets . if mid-sized businesses succeed in continuing to refine their competitiveness through further specialization and investments in innovative products then they would be in a very good position to profit from globalization , he said . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country from hunting to tires , from baking to wires , hundreds of trade fairs in germany cover a wide spectrum of business fields each year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.03.2006 rejuvenating the rhine river großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is one of germany 's most picturesque waterways a german state plans to earmark a part of the rhine river as a special protection zone to meet eu requirements on preserving the natural habitat .
but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .
nowadays , migratory species such as salmon have not only reappeared but are surviving in the rhine . klaus markgraf-maué a rhine river expert from nabu , a german conservation group , is pleased that even fishermen are coming back . " everyone along the rhine who is engaged in environmental aspects is proud to have them back because it 's a good sign concerning the water quality , " markgraf-maué said . satisfyi n g eu requireme n ts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine , germany 's largest river , needs to be better protected while environmentalists are happy that the rhine is in such good condition and that fish like salmon and shad are returning to its waters , the eu wants further protection for the waterway . in 1992 , lawmakers in brussels passed the flora , fauna , habitat directive , or ffh .
by signing on to the ffh , eu countries promise to preserve and protect natural habitats , including rivers , lakes and streams , within some four million square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 million square miles -rrb- of europe . but deciding what exactly should be protected is a matter of national or local sovereignty .
in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .
" we have marked out a few fish sanctuaries that we believe and that experts also believe to be sufficient and that will protect and sustain the habitats in question . " too little or too much ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is germany 's most important thoroughfares for ships for the time being , the proposal of north rhine-westphalia 's government 's looks set to be approved by the eu .
but it has been criticized by shipping companies on the one hand as being excessive , and on the other by environmentalists who say it does n't go far enough . " the scientific advisors of the eu have hinted that our recommendations will be accepted , " fliege said .
" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals . " it covers only a small part of the habitat , " he said .
" the most important part that is missing the central part of the river , the shipping channel itself , because nowadays we have only parts on both sides , the river banks . " co n crete walls according to conservationists , the situation in the central part of the rhine is where the crux of the problem is .
fish species that live on the bottom of the shipping channels will pay the price and lose valuable habitats should the river need to be dredged in the future - and this may be unavoidable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows of cars on a cargo ship on the rhine but even in areas other than the shipping channels , the rhine flows through a man-made straitjacket of embankments and concrete walls , mostly past cities and towns .
and it 's the areas where these walls are of little use that should be given priority . " the goal of our project , ' living rhine , ' is to put concrete out of the bank and to have more space for dynamics along the river , " markgraf-maué said . john kluempers -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says german forests are ailing german forests , immortalized by goethe in poems , are far removed from their image of robust health .

if lawmakers fund the project , germans could resolve unanswered questions within five rather than hundreds of years . west berlin journalist holger kulick often visited the east of the divided city in the 1980s .
after east and west germany were finally reunified , he got the reconstructed dossier compiled on him by east germany 's domestic intelligence service , the stasi , and found out that writer sascha anderson , a close friend in east berlin , had spied on him . " it was painful to read in the reconstituted files that he 'd obviously passed on what i 'd told him in confidence .

" we 're dealing with very special inventory here , " said günter bormann , a spokesman for the federal stasi files agency .
" these are files that were torn up manually , by hand , in the final weeks of the intelligence service .
so we may conclude that we 're dealing with fairly important documents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi staffers started shredding files when they saw the gdr 's downfall looming since 1995 , the stasi files agency has delivered sacks full of the scraps of paper to a small outpost in zirndorf , bavaria .

there 's plenty to do , " said spokesman gerd pfeiffer . there are about 600 million paper scraps in more than 16,000 sacks in storage in magdeburg packed with details of german history .
reconstruction at the present rate will take hundreds of years .
so wolfgang thierse , vice president of the bundestag , has called on parliament to agree to fund a pilot project to computerize reconstruction - despite germany 's tight budget position . " the most important principle we anchored into law was making this past accessible - to make this legacy available to the victims , researchers and the german public , " said thierse .
" and the consequence of that decision is that we are obliged to digitally reconstruct these torn-up files . " researchers at berlin 's fraunhofer institute have been testing digital reconstruction for years .
scraps of paper are scanned into a computer and , using recognition criteria like shape , color and typographical details , they are sorted and aligned using special software .
it only takes a few seconds to recreate a page .
experts estimate it would take around five years to reconstruct all the stasi files .
the pilot project would cost about 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi sorted the scraps into bags according to room and desk , which makes reconstruction easier " many people are already coming here from abroad , from former communist countries , and also from other former dictatorships : spain , argentina , south africa , " thierse said .

but even some small and mid-sized firms such as famous pencil-maker faber castello or toymaker playmobil have made their mark internationally .
innovative and tech-savvy , they 've managed to stay one step ahead of the competition and hold on to their leading position in the world market . but that 's not to say all mid-sized german companies are so successful . " we have the impression that it depends on the size , " said hartmut schauerte , parliamentary state secretary in the german federal ministry for economics .
" the smaller they are the more fearful they are and the bigger they are the more decidedly at home they are in world markets . " backbone of the german economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrea schauer , ceo of german toymaker playmobil poses with a toy castle medium-sized businesses are often considered the backbone of the german economy .
it 's easy to see why .
around 70 percent of all german employees work at small and mid-sized companies , which are defined as firms that have a yearly turnover of 50 million euros -lrb- $ 59.7 million -rrb- and less than 500 workers . however , in reality most of the companies are actually smaller than that : some 80 percent of the total 3.5 million small and mid-sized companies have less than 10 employees . and for most , globalization poses a huge challenge .
according to a study by the kfw bank group , german mid-sized firms are already over well over average on a european level when it comes to being international involvement .
every fourth mid-sized company exports its products abroad and that does have an effect on turnover , said kfw supervisory board chairman hans reich . " our estimates show that a german mid-sized business achieves , on an average , 17 percent of its turnover abroad , " reich said .
" against that , the 15 eu nations -lrb- before eastward expansion -rrb- are estimated to have had an export average of just 12 percent in 2002 . " rising foreign direct investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german company in saxony manufactures and largely exports beer coasters small german companies export two-thirds of their products to the eu , thus making it its most important market . but it 's not just exports that have skyrocketed ; even direct foreign investments have climbed steadily in the past few years .
mid-sized german firms currently invest some 2.5 million euros abroad on an average , mainly to gain access to further markets , according to reich . political changes in central and eastern europe have significantly added new impetus to the trend . " for mid-sized suppliers in particular , the setting up of an own production outlet in the vicinity of the final product manufacturer became a question of survival : they had to follow their big customers abroad , " reich added . indeed , countries in central and eastern europe have proved to be the most important target regions for direct investments after the core eu nations .
almost 30 percent of all foreign investments by german mid-sized firms are channeled to the region - that 's almost 10 times more than what the entire german economy invests in central and eastern europe . " central and eastern europe - i 'll underline it again - is a curse and blessing at the same time , " reich said . though jobs are increasingly moving there , the german firms manage to get cheaper preliminary products there . " we also create income there that would spur demand for german products , " reich said .
" and we integrate central and eastern europe much more strongly in german economic developments than any other european country can and does . " government lends a helping hand the german government , too , is increasingly playing a role in the new developments .
hoping to keep qualified jobs in germany , berlin plans to strongly promote mid-sized firms that are internationally active .
and it 's also stepping up federal financial guarantees for such companies by increasing the yearly budget for it to 2.5 billion euros . schauerte of the german economics ministry is also pinning hopes on so-called cluster building where small companies are encouraged to organize their foreign operations and their sales and distribution sectors together . in addition , the german government also plans to invest more in trade fairs . " we plan to financially support 265 trade fairs and exhibitions abroad , " schauerte said .
" i think we 're world leaders in the field .
it 's important to us that small and mid-sized companies are part of it . " in light of the fact that globalization 's march will continue unhindered , kfw boss reich believes that more and more german mid-sized firms will focus on foreign markets . if mid-sized businesses succeed in continuing to refine their competitiveness through further specialization and investments in innovative products then they would be in a very good position to profit from globalization , he said . sabine kinkartz -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , the trade fair country from hunting to tires , from baking to wires , hundreds of trade fairs in germany cover a wide spectrum of business fields each year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.03.2006 rejuvenating the rhine river großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is one of germany 's most picturesque waterways a german state plans to earmark a part of the rhine river as a special protection zone to meet eu requirements on preserving the natural habitat .
but the move has elicited mixed reactions . germany 's most treasured waterway for both tourists and germans alike was treated like a stepchild during the first three-quarters of the 20th century . from the upper reaches of the river in switzerland and southern germany to its delta in the netherlands , the rhine was used as a dumping ground by both industries and cities . but it was n't until 1986 when the sandoz chemical spill in basel , switzerland , happened , that measures were at last taken to clean up one of europe 's most scenic rivers . two decades ago , it would have been unthinkable to eat fish and other marine animals caught in the river .
nowadays , migratory species such as salmon have not only reappeared but are surviving in the rhine . klaus markgraf-maué a rhine river expert from nabu , a german conservation group , is pleased that even fishermen are coming back . " everyone along the rhine who is engaged in environmental aspects is proud to have them back because it 's a good sign concerning the water quality , " markgraf-maué said . satisfyi n g eu requireme n ts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine , germany 's largest river , needs to be better protected while environmentalists are happy that the rhine is in such good condition and that fish like salmon and shad are returning to its waters , the eu wants further protection for the waterway . in 1992 , lawmakers in brussels passed the flora , fauna , habitat directive , or ffh .
by signing on to the ffh , eu countries promise to preserve and protect natural habitats , including rivers , lakes and streams , within some four million square kilometers -lrb- 1.5 million square miles -rrb- of europe . but deciding what exactly should be protected is a matter of national or local sovereignty .
in germany , individual states are held responsible .
the environmental ministry of north-rhine westphalia has proposed to set aside 30 percent of the rhine river under the ffh directive . " the purpose is to determine and create the habitats for rare fish , " said markus fliege , a ministry spokesperson .
" we have marked out a few fish sanctuaries that we believe and that experts also believe to be sufficient and that will protect and sustain the habitats in question . " too little or too much ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rhine is germany 's most important thoroughfares for ships for the time being , the proposal of north rhine-westphalia 's government 's looks set to be approved by the eu .
but it has been criticized by shipping companies on the one hand as being excessive , and on the other by environmentalists who say it does n't go far enough . " the scientific advisors of the eu have hinted that our recommendations will be accepted , " fliege said .
" we have heard that some environmentalists as well as some business associations are not 100 percent satisfied with this .
but this simply confirms that our solution lies in-between and is a sensible one . " politics is almost always a matter of compromise , and the current center-right government in düsseldorf prides itself on the fact that its proposal goes further than that of its predecessors which included the environmental greens . nevertheless , nabu expert markgraf-maué , who jointly heads a project to promote the habitat along and on germany 's longest river , called " living rhine " , points to holes in the proposals . " it covers only a small part of the habitat , " he said .
" the most important part that is missing the central part of the river , the shipping channel itself , because nowadays we have only parts on both sides , the river banks . " co n crete walls according to conservationists , the situation in the central part of the rhine is where the crux of the problem is .
fish species that live on the bottom of the shipping channels will pay the price and lose valuable habitats should the river need to be dredged in the future - and this may be unavoidable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rows of cars on a cargo ship on the rhine but even in areas other than the shipping channels , the rhine flows through a man-made straitjacket of embankments and concrete walls , mostly past cities and towns .
and it 's the areas where these walls are of little use that should be given priority . " the goal of our project , ' living rhine , ' is to put concrete out of the bank and to have more space for dynamics along the river , " markgraf-maué said . john kluempers -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : report says german forests are ailing german forests , immortalized by goethe in poems , are far removed from their image of robust health .

truro lib dem mp matthew taylor says an increasing number of second home owners are choosing to register their properties as small businesses .
he says by filling in a government form they can convert to paying business rates and claim rate relief of up to 50 % - instead of registering for council tax and receiving only a 10 % discount .
" people are saving four , five , six , seven hundred pounds a year , so it is no surprise it is happening , " said mr taylor .
" as a result it is also virtually impossible to tell exactly how many second homes there are in cornwall because you can not tell which are genuine businesses and which are holiday homes . "
mr taylor said at least one local council had seen a rise in the number of domestic properties being registered as small businesses - along with a drop in the number of second homes being registered for council tax .
malcolm brown , senior research and information officer at cornwall county council said there was anecdotal evidence that people were exploiting the loophole , but there is a bigger underlying problem .
" the figures the government produces do n't make sense .
" they show that there has been a fall in the number of second homes up to 2001 , when it 's obvious to anyone here that the number has gone up , " he said .
a spokesman for the office of the deputy prime minister said in a statement : " we do not believe that many second home owners are paying business rates when they should be paying council tax .

age concern say high bills mean more old people have died this winter already - before the big 25 % increases have even arrived in our bills .
yet , in radio scotland 's investigation - hot air - we have discovered a heat loss crisis in scotland to rival its dire figures on fuel poverty .
one in four scots is having to choose between heating and eating .
scary enough , you 'd think , to make sure precious heat is not being wasted .
but new research shows scotland is the least energy efficient country in northern europe .
the proof lies in the 1999 eu energy performance survey which compared insulation standards - and in the thermal imaging work of stewart little and his firm irt surveys in dundee . "
sometimes whole elevations have been missed out by cavity wall companies that were meant to make new buildings air tight in the 80s " irt have surveyed 9,000 homes on behalf of councils and housing associations - and found 60 % are missing insulation .
and not just small patches .
sometimes whole elevations have been missed out by cavity wall companies that were meant to make new buildings air tight in the 80s .
but even small non-insulated patches or cold bridges can suck out heat and leave cold damp patches - one of the ideal conditions for the microbes that trigger asthma .
it 's not just old council houses - a thermal image of prestige public buildings last year , funded by scottish gas , showed heat loss -lrb- red and white patches -rrb- from cladding panels at the scottish parliament .
one year on , the problem 's slightly worse as you can see by going to the radio scotland website .
holyrood 's managers are still considering what to do - and discovering that it 's not easy to make buildings air tight once they 're built .
school designers so you 'd think all planners and politicians would be demanding new public buildings are perfect .
wrong again .
" temperatures range between 26-32 degrees celsius when the sun in shining on south facing classrooms - even in early february and late october . "
" classrooms go from tropical to arctic .
heating controls are often behind units .
air flow limited due to non-opening windows and low ceilings . "
complaints like these were made by three in four of scotland 's first pfi schools in an eis survey last year .
it seems many school designers and pfi developers failed to take account of heat from kids , computers and lights .
the result - open windows in january and vents pumping valuable heat out to playgrounds to make classrooms bearable .
what a waste .
how many of our offices are the same ?
but you 'd assume an expensive , private new home would be different .
wrong again .
a properly insulated ceiling in a thermal image should appear as a uniform red / yellow colour - but that 's not what we found in a brand new , three-bedroom , £ 250,000 home in angus .
the loft insulation clearly failed building regulations but the house had been passed by angus council and the house building guarantors the nhbc .
so can we always believe the professionals - the building industry , the building control inspectors or the nhbc - when they say a building is air tight ?
would n't it be easier for the scottish executive to toughen scotland 's building regulations so that completion certificates depended on passing air tightness tests ?
paul tuohy is a researcher at strathclyde university 's energy systems research unit and he has made some calculations about how much we 'd all save if politicians decided to act .
he says : if all buildings were brought up to 2002 insulation standards we 'd save £ 329 per householder pa -lrb- or £ 2m saved across scotland per day ! -rrb-
if all buildings were brought up to the best german design standards we 'd save £ 593 per household per annum -lrb- £ 3.6m across scotland per day -rrb- if all buildings were brought up to german standards with micro generation -lrb- rooftop wind turbines or solar panels -rrb- we 'd save £ 660 pa -lrb- £ 4m across scotland per day -rrb- that could mean a heating bill of just £ 141 not £ 1,000 and 50 % fewer carbon emissions per household .
these very low energy bills are not fantasy - they 're being achieved in more than 1,000 villages , towns and cities across europe right now .
by contrast , many scottish homes keep leaking heat by accident - and many scottish schools , offices and indeed our parliament keep pumping heat out by design .
we are wasting millions , contributing more to global warming than industry , letting pensioners get cold despite free central heating systems they ca n't afford to switch on , and letting kids get asthma in damp cold bedrooms and overheated classrooms .
the very latest news from the executive is good - new building regulations released in the last few days will improve what 's expected of new homes .
condensing boilers are in .
better loft insulation is also in .
though mandatory air tightness tests are not .
you can see more at the scottish building standards agency website .
the big question for ministers is this - how can they enforce better standards on new homes and how can they fix the poor insulation standards and heat loss from existing homes ?

but even small non-insulated patches or cold bridges can suck out heat and leave cold damp patches - one of the ideal conditions for the microbes that trigger asthma .
it 's not just old council houses - a thermal image of prestige public buildings last year , funded by scottish gas , showed heat loss -lrb- red and white patches -rrb- from cladding panels at the scottish parliament .
one year on , the problem 's slightly worse as you can see by going to the radio scotland website .
holyrood 's managers are still considering what to do - and discovering that it 's not easy to make buildings air tight once they 're built .
school designers so you 'd think all planners and politicians would be demanding new public buildings are perfect .
wrong again .
" temperatures range between 26-32 degrees celsius when the sun in shining on south facing classrooms - even in early february and late october . "
" classrooms go from tropical to arctic .
heating controls are often behind units .
air flow limited due to non-opening windows and low ceilings . "
complaints like these were made by three in four of scotland 's first pfi schools in an eis survey last year .
heat loss from the executive headquarters was also assessed it seems many school designers and pfi developers failed to take account of heat from kids , computers and lights .
the result - open windows in january and vents pumping valuable heat out to playgrounds to make classrooms bearable .
what a waste .
how many of our offices are the same ?
but you 'd assume an expensive , private new home would be different .
wrong again .
a properly insulated ceiling in a thermal image should appear as a uniform red / yellow colour - but that 's not what we found in a brand new , three-bedroom , £ 250,000 home in angus .
the loft insulation clearly failed building regulations but the house had been passed by angus council and the house building guarantors the nhbc .
so can we always believe the professionals - the building industry , the building control inspectors or the nhbc - when they say a building is air tight ?
would n't it be easier for the scottish executive to toughen scotland 's building regulations so that completion certificates depended on passing air tightness tests ?
paul tuohy is a researcher at strathclyde university 's energy systems research unit and he has made some calculations about how much we 'd all save if politicians decided to act .
he says : if all buildings were brought up to 2002 insulation standards we 'd save £ 329 per householder pa -lrb- or £ 2m saved across scotland per day ! -rrb-
if all buildings were brought up to the best german design standards we 'd save £ 593 per household per annum -lrb- £ 3.6m across scotland per day -rrb- if all buildings were brought up to german standards with micro generation -lrb- rooftop wind turbines or solar panels -rrb- we 'd save £ 660 pa -lrb- £ 4m across scotland per day -rrb- that could mean a heating bill of just £ 141 not £ 1,000 and 50 % fewer carbon emissions per household .
these very low energy bills are not fantasy - they 're being achieved in more than 1,000 villages , towns and cities across europe right now .
by contrast , many scottish homes keep leaking heat by accident - and many scottish schools , offices and indeed our parliament keep pumping heat out by design .
we are wasting millions , contributing more to global warming than industry , letting pensioners get cold despite free central heating systems they ca n't afford to switch on , and letting kids get asthma in damp cold bedrooms and overheated classrooms .
the very latest news from the executive is good - new building regulations released in the last few days will improve what 's expected of new homes .
condensing boilers are in .
better loft insulation is also in .
though mandatory air tightness tests are not .
you can see more at the scottish building standards agency website .

premier wen jiabao addressed 3,000 delegates at the national people 's congress in beijing .
he predicted china 's economy would grow by 8 % this year and by an average of 7.5 % over the next four years .
he promised extra money for rural areas and farmers , to spread growing wealth to the impoverished countryside .
" building a ' new socialist countryside ' is a major historic task , " mr wen told the conference .
as the conference got under way , thousands of security personnel swarmed around tiananmen square , which was blocked off to the public .
protesters were prevented from reaching the area and there were reports of at least one arrest , although this could not be independently confirmed .
discontent growing he said the government plans to spend 340bn yuan -lrb- $ 42bn ; £ 24bn -rrb- this year upgrading agriculture , and billions more on rural social services .
the government is concerned about growing rural unrest as the hundreds of millions of rural poor are left behind by china 's surging urban economy .
the npc is a major part of the chinese political year its own figures report 87,000 protests and other incidents of discontent last year .
the " new socialist countryside " is the buzz phrase in the communist party at the moment , says the bbc 's rupert wingfield-hayes in beijing .
tackling rural tensions is a priority , as there is a sense that if they continue to grow they could pose a major threat to chinese stability .
" some deeply seated conflicts that have accumulated over a long time have yet to be fundamentally resolved , and new problems have arisen that can not be ignored , " mr wen said .
china must " pay more attention to social equity and social stability so that all the people can enjoy the fruits of reform and development " .
military growth mr wen also addressed the prickly issue of taiwan , which china claims as part of its territory .
" it is the people 's will for cross-strait relations to develop in a direction of peace , stability and mutual benefit , " he said .
on the eve of the congress , china announced defence spending would increase by 14 % - the latest in a series of big annual rises which have prompted concern from neighbouring countries .
there are fears among some in taiwan that if it declares formal independence , china will attack .

premier wen jiabao addressed 3,000 delegates at the national people 's congress in beijing .
he predicted china 's economy would grow by 8 % this year and by an average of 7.5 % over the next four years .
he promised extra money for rural areas and farmers , to spread growing wealth to the impoverished countryside .
" building a ' new socialist countryside ' is a major historic task , " mr wen told the conference .
as the conference got under way , thousands of security personnel swarmed around tiananmen square , which was blocked off to the public .
protesters were prevented from reaching the area and there were reports of at least one arrest , although this could not be independently confirmed .

the government is concerned about growing rural unrest as the hundreds of millions of rural poor are left behind by china 's surging urban economy .
the npc is a major part of the chinese political year its own figures report 87,000 protests and other incidents of discontent last year .

i speak as an asthma suffering ex-smoker , living in lerwick , who is unable to go out to pubs because of the fog of cigarette smoke .
i am definitely no reformed smoker , preferring instead to try to educate those smokers around me who poison themselves first and the rest of us second .
the ban has been well advertised , but still many establishments are holding out to the last moment until they impose the ban , rather than grasping the nettle , protecting their staff and letting the rest of us , the majority , have an evening out without returning home with foul smelling clothes and hair through the effects of cigarette smoke .
i am unable to understand the logic of the owners of these establishments , who believe that their profits will be reduced if they ban smoking .
that is obviously completely wrong .
there are more non-smokers now than smokers and i constantly hear my friends bemoaning the way their evening out is spoilt by cigarette smoke .
you ca n't even stand in the bus shelter outside the hospital in lerwick as it is full of nhs smokers dying for another fix . "
the views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and are not endorsed by the bbc .
we asked for your views on the ban .
the following represents the balance of opinion we received .
i put all my clothes in the wash after a night out regardless if i 've been in a smoky atmosphere or not .
you non smokers must be a smelly lot .
pl , aberdeen the cigarettes i smoke are legally imported , legally bought , tax paid and in other words , fully endorsed by this government and all before it .
tobacco will not be made illegal , it generates too much revenue , and to illegalise it would be paydirt to organised crime .
furthermore , the tobacco companies remain highly successful and profitable for its shareholders , i wonder how many anti-smokers even check if their endowments , pension funds etc are invested in some measure in these companies ?
the smell of my cigarettes is nothing to the stench of hypocrisy emanating from the proponents of this ban .
liz barber , stockton on tees , england i read the news from scotland every morning and every evening .
i admire the people of my ancestral home .
i know that you are all concerned about education , crime , and tolls on the forth road bridge .
none the less , i am so impressed with the incredible amount of progress that scotland has made since 1999 when the scottish parliament first sat .
please understand that in the us , we ca n't even approve a garden plan in that amount of time .
as to the smoking ban , i have been waiting for such a ban to happen here in philadelphia .
i am so eager to go out and enjoy the pubs and a nice pint .
i ca n't with all the smoke .
i have tried to get owners to do a smoke free night , or even a smoke free room , and they all fiercely refused .
i now go up to new york when i want to go out .
perhaps , some people will stay home and just drink beer in their living room so they can smoke , that 's fine .
it means they wo n't drink-drive .
but , people like me will be standing in ready to take their place at the bar .
the one thing i do n't understand is why no-one has approved the idea of a good smoking lounge in pubs .
think about it , a nice room with a double airlock door , and separate ventilation system .
smokers could go in there and smoke , drink , and still come out and join up with other friends .
i 'd have no problems with that .
j nathan , philadelphia i can not understand for the life of me how people can object to the smoking ban .
the ban is not on smoking but smoking is public place .
i do n't think people should take it personally .
i myself ca n't wait for the ban .
as a non smoker i feel i have a right to enjoy going to a pub or restaurant without having to breathe in other people 's smoke .
people who smoke have a choice .
but those who do n't smoke do not .
we have to breathe in second hand smoke whether we like it or not .
we could go to a non smoking pub , but then why should our freedom to choose be taken away from us by a minority .
i do not think the ban will have a big financial impact on the pub trade , although i suspect firms may use it as an excuse to increase prices .
but then if it is going to save lives it 's worth it .
if you want to smoke then on you go , but please let those that do n't live their lives free from your poisonous fumes .
gilbert maclellan , livingston i 'm just sick of being increasingly controlled and monitored by our nanny state .
yes , i am a smoker and do believe that people should not have to be around others ' smoke if they choose not to . choice is the key .
in more and more areas of life people 's choices are being eroded further by the day and the smoking ban is an outrageous example .
clearly the scot executive are still going for easy targets to create populist headlines in the tabloids ... almost as if they can not quite believe they have been given so much power ... ' give a small boy a hammer and he 'll hit everything he sees ' . well it 's time for some serious policy ... its time to make scotland a country that the rest of the world can take seriously .
paul goodship , strathaven i 'm a non smoker who would ultimately like to see smoking banned from all bars .
owners and managers who oppose the ban will quickly change their mind if they are successfully sued by their staff for damage caused by passive smoking .
while i do n't like smoking and the smell it leaves on my clothes i make the choice at the moment to go to front bars where it occurs but hopefully before long that choice will no longer be necessary .
bob shepherd , south australia a third of the scottish electorate smoke , with ons polls consistently showing that two thirds of the public , smokers and non-smokers alike , favour separate smoking and non-smoking facilities , as opposed to a total ban .
why then go through a consultation process and then completely disregard the findings ?
as adults we are allowed choices , on all manner of things , but these choices are consistently being eroded by government deciding what 's best for us .
these matters should be left to public opinion and not legislated prohibition , with the use of public services , to police our private lives .
the indecent haste with which the legislation has been enacted brings our fledgling ' democracy ' into further disrepute .
especially when the scientific facts , pertaining to environmental tobacco smoke have been grossly misrepresented and deliberately misconstrued .
it was surprising that other than the conservative party , not one of our politicians stood up for the legitimate rights of such a large minority group .
which is probably another reason , whereby ordinary people are being turned off by the party system and politicians .
democratic government should aim to protect the public not only from the tyranny of the minority , but also from the tyranny of the majority .
don mclean , east kilbride in response to steve b 's comments earlier in the conversation , he fails to note one key difference between smoking and drinking : smokers can not smoke in a public place without affecting everyone around them .
drinkers can drink in a public place without affecting anyone around them , with the possible exception of spilling a pint on their shoes .
the task is not to stop smokers from smoking , it 's to stop them affecting other people .
michael kaye , london the majority of smokers are quietly pleased about the ban as it will give them a real chance to quit .
pubs , clubs and restaurants will be much nicer places to be , and i will certainly be patronising them a lot more .
the person who said smoke free pubs lacked atmosphere has obviously never come home after a night out in a scottish pub and had to put all their clothes in the washing machine , then have a shower before going to bed because they stank of smoke .
some atmosphere !
helen , midlothian i 've been in some really dull no-smoking california bars .
in contrast , new york bars were smoking and bouncing .
coincidence ?
personally , i 'd like to see alcohol banned as well .
it 's an addictive drug that costs innocent lives and at the very least it makes crashing bores of ex-smokers .
it 's social acceptance means drink-drivers use it as an excuse for killing somebody and getting lighter sentences .
it costs the economy millions of man-hours in days off from hangovers and the attendant incompetence of liquid lunchtimes .
there 's as little justification for it as smoking .
steve b , edinburgh i too am an asthma sufferer and as such have to avoid smoky hotels , pubs etc so i am really looking forward to march 26th .
in light of the challenge by alan bowes of the swallow group to try and stop the no smoking ban at this late stage , i will of course now be avoiding any swallow hotels .
the great majority are behind the smoking ban , but clearly mr bowes fears for his profits rather than the health of his workers and clients .
i am sure there will be many people like myself who will maybe vote with their feet with regard to the swallow group jules , nairn as a smoker the ban does not bother me one way or another .
i am sick of listening to people who can talk about nothing else .
i believe the ban will improve the health of the nation .
i am concerned that a lot of people are also going to suffer , small bars who 's main income comes from smokers may be forced to close as custom will fall .
large brewery-based pubs may lower prices to tempt people in but smaller privately owned bars will have to increase prices to compensate for the drop in custom , the pub trade has been in decline for a while and this may prove to be the final nail in the coffin for most businesses , especially if landlords get fined up to £ 500 if someone drops a cigarette at their front door .
it should be through choice and only law to ban smoking in places where food is to be served. there is already one bar in edinburgh which is non-smoking and i have never seen more than 4 people in it .
finally as a smoker who will hopefully be giving up i have one last question - will smokers get free patches on the nhs from the 26th ?
i fear the answer is no , after all it is a recognised addiction. heroine addicts get free methadone to assist them and that is an illegal act in the first place .
joseph kruszyna , edinburgh i am from greenock and have lived in the us for about three years now and the ban hit here about a year ago .
i am a smoker and have been for a long time .
even when i quit for nine years i never begrudged anyone of having a smoke .
now in the past year all the bars in austin have been going down the drain and i am not talking about your big bars down town i mean the little ones you go to on the way home from work .
it has unfortunately led most of these bars to start letting people smoke again just so they can get people back in the bars as it 's better to take the fine every night rather than close .
i do n't think anyone has the right to tell anyone how to live their life and if you want to smoke then smoke .
if you want to drink then drink and that means if i want to open a pub so i can let people come in and have a beer and a smoke then that should be my choice not yours .
all it would take would be a notice on the door saying smoking or non smoking .
stuart mcbrearty , texas great .
the scottish executive have banned smoking .
when are they going to tackle grown-up issues like drugs / crime / self-respect ?
do n't wait up .
anne macmillan , helensburgh in response to brian petrie : " maybe they should just line all us nicotine addicts up against a wall and let a rampaging non-smoker pull the trigger " .
surely it would be quicker and cheaper for you in the long run , with ultimately the same outcome !
jamie hayes , horsham can the scottish executive please ban all those old american movies from my tv where almost everyone smokes e.g. casablanca .
americans are very vociferous about being anti-smoking and yet they do n't take any responsibility for being the cause .
audrey i can not express strongly enough how appalled i am at the legal challenge to the smoking ban being pursued by swallow group .
the ban on smoking in public places does not ban smoking , it simply forces smokers to choose somewhere else to smoke .
to put pub profits before the health of the people of scotland , and to do so unilaterally is very condescending , and to suggest that this ban is being implemented against the wishes of the people is ridiculous .
i for one will be boycotting all swallow group holdings immediately , and i hope this objection is rejected out of hand .
alex holstead , armadale i am in scotland twice a year .
i ca n't wait to be able to go into a pub and not come out stinking ! !
in the past when i have complained about patrons next to me smoking , i have been considered one of those " rude americans " -lrb- although i am much more scottish than american -rrb- .
i ca n't wait ! ! !
anne holladay-wallace , tennessee usa where are all the restaurants that allow smoking ?
non-smokers seem to find them easily enough , but i , as a smoker , only seem to find ones that quite rightly , do n't allow smoking at tables .
some have bars where smoking is permitted , but generally a smoker would need to go outside to enjoy a puff .
i 'm sure most smokers accept the ban is coming soon and probably will be a jolt for a few to quit .
i find in general , non-smokers have been on the rampage over the last few months in the media .
there are far more considerate smokers than inconsiderate ones in my view , who happily freeze half to death for their fix , but as usual we are all tarred with the same filter tipped brush .
maybe they should just line all us nicotine addicts up against a wall and let a rampaging non-smoker pull the trigger brian petrie , carnoustie e-mail this to a friend related to this story : smoking panel : davy douglas -lrb- 03 mar 06 -pipe- scotland -rrb- smoking panel : inga dowds -lrb- 03 mar 06 -pipe- scotland -rrb- smoking panel : frazer gillespie -lrb- 03 mar 06 -pipe- scotland -rrb- smoking panel : margaret mackenzie -lrb- 03 mar 06 -pipe- scotland -rrb- related internet links : smoking , health and social care -lrb- scotland -rrb- bill editorial guidelines - personal view , authored programmes & websites health - tips to give up smoking the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites search bbc news : news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine newswatch -pipe- notes -pipe- contact us -pipe- about bbc news -pipe- profiles -pipe- history ^ back to top -pipe- bbc sport home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- contact us -pipe- help -pipe- ©

i speak as an asthma suffering ex-smoker , living in lerwick , who is unable to go out to pubs because of the fog of cigarette smoke .
i am definitely no reformed smoker , preferring instead to try to educate those smokers around me who poison themselves first and the rest of us second .
the ban has been well advertised , but still many establishments are holding out to the last moment until they impose the ban , rather than grasping the nettle , protecting their staff and letting the rest of us , the majority , have an evening out without returning home with foul smelling clothes and hair through the effects of cigarette smoke .
i am unable to understand the logic of the owners of these establishments , who believe that their profits will be reduced if they ban smoking .
that is obviously completely wrong .
there are more non-smokers now than smokers and i constantly hear my friends bemoaning the way their evening out is spoilt by cigarette smoke .
you ca n't even stand in the bus shelter outside the hospital in lerwick as it is full of nhs smokers dying for another fix .
the views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and are not endorsed by the bbc .
we asked for your views on the ban .
the following represents the balance of opinion we received .
i put all my clothes in the wash after a night out regardless if i 've been in a smoky atmosphere or not .

in more and more areas of life people 's choices are being eroded further by the day and the smoking ban is an outrageous example .
clearly the scot executive are still going for easy targets to create populist headlines in the tabloids ... almost as if they can not quite believe they have been given so much power ... ' give a small boy a hammer and he 'll hit everything he sees ' . well it 's time for some serious policy ... its time to make scotland a country that the rest of the world can take seriously .
paul goodship , strathaven i 'm a non smoker who would ultimately like to see smoking banned from all bars .
owners and managers who oppose the ban will quickly change their mind if they are successfully sued by their staff for damage caused by passive smoking .
while i do n't like smoking and the smell it leaves on my clothes i make the choice at the moment to go to front bars where it occurs but hopefully before long that choice will no longer be necessary .
bob shepherd , south australia a third of the scottish electorate smoke , with ons polls consistently showing that two thirds of the public , smokers and non-smokers alike , favour separate smoking and non-smoking facilities , as opposed to a total ban .
why then go through a consultation process and then completely disregard the findings ?
as adults we are allowed choices , on all manner of things , but these choices are consistently being eroded by government deciding what 's best for us .
these matters should be left to public opinion and not legislated prohibition , with the use of public services , to police our private lives .
the indecent haste with which the legislation has been enacted brings our fledgling ' democracy ' into further disrepute .
especially when the scientific facts , pertaining to environmental tobacco smoke have been grossly misrepresented and deliberately misconstrued .
it was surprising that other than the conservative party , not one of our politicians stood up for the legitimate rights of such a large minority group .
which is probably another reason , whereby ordinary people are being turned off by the party system and politicians .
democratic government should aim to protect the public not only from the tyranny of the minority , but also from the tyranny of the majority .
don mclean , east kilbride in response to steve b 's comments earlier in the conversation , he fails to note one key difference between smoking and drinking : smokers can not smoke in a public place without affecting everyone around them .
drinkers can drink in a public place without affecting anyone around them , with the possible exception of spilling a pint on their shoes .
the task is not to stop smokers from smoking , it 's to stop them affecting other people .
michael kaye , london the majority of smokers are quietly pleased about the ban as it will give them a real chance to quit .
pubs , clubs and restaurants will be much nicer places to be , and i will certainly be patronising them a lot more .
the person who said smoke free pubs lacked atmosphere has obviously never come home after a night out in a scottish pub and had to put all their clothes in the washing machine , then have a shower before going to bed because they stank of smoke .
some atmosphere !
helen , midlothian i 've been in some really dull no-smoking california bars .
in contrast , new york bars were smoking and bouncing .
coincidence ?
personally , i 'd like to see alcohol banned as well .
it 's an addictive drug that costs innocent lives and at the very least it makes crashing bores of ex-smokers .
it 's social acceptance means drink-drivers use it as an excuse for killing somebody and getting lighter sentences .
it costs the economy millions of man-hours in days off from hangovers and the attendant incompetence of liquid lunchtimes .
there 's as little justification for it as smoking .
steve b , edinburgh i too am an asthma sufferer and as such have to avoid smoky hotels , pubs etc so i am really looking forward to march 26th .
in light of the challenge by alan bowes of the swallow group to try and stop the no smoking ban at this late stage , i will of course now be avoiding any swallow hotels .
the great majority are behind the smoking ban , but clearly mr bowes fears for his profits rather than the health of his workers and clients .
i am sure there will be many people like myself who will maybe vote with their feet with regard to the swallow group jules , nairn as a smoker the ban does not bother me one way or another .
i am sick of listening to people who can talk about nothing else .
i believe the ban will improve the health of the nation .
i am concerned that a lot of people are also going to suffer , small bars who 's main income comes from smokers may be forced to close as custom will fall .
large brewery-based pubs may lower prices to tempt people in but smaller privately owned bars will have to increase prices to compensate for the drop in custom , the pub trade has been in decline for a while and this may prove to be the final nail in the coffin for most businesses , especially if landlords get fined up to £ 500 if someone drops a cigarette at their front door .
it should be through choice and only law to ban smoking in places where food is to be served. there is already one bar in edinburgh which is non-smoking and i have never seen more than 4 people in it .
finally as a smoker who will hopefully be giving up i have one last question - will smokers get free patches on the nhs from the 26th ?
i fear the answer is no , after all it is a recognised addiction. heroine addicts get free methadone to assist them and that is an illegal act in the first place .
joseph kruszyna , edinburgh i am from greenock and have lived in the us for about three years now and the ban hit here about a year ago .
i am a smoker and have been for a long time .
even when i quit for nine years i never begrudged anyone of having a smoke .
now in the past year all the bars in austin have been going down the drain and i am not talking about your big bars down town i mean the little ones you go to on the way home from work .
it has unfortunately led most of these bars to start letting people smoke again just so they can get people back in the bars as it 's better to take the fine every night rather than close .
i do n't think anyone has the right to tell anyone how to live their life and if you want to smoke then smoke .
if you want to drink then drink and that means if i want to open a pub so i can let people come in and have a beer and a smoke then that should be my choice not yours .
all it would take would be a notice on the door saying smoking or non smoking .
stuart mcbrearty , texas great .
the scottish executive have banned smoking .
when are they going to tackle grown-up issues like drugs / crime / self-respect ?
do n't wait up .
anne macmillan , helensburgh in response to brian petrie : " maybe they should just line all us nicotine addicts up against a wall and let a rampaging non-smoker pull the trigger " .
surely it would be quicker and cheaper for you in the long run , with ultimately the same outcome !
jamie hayes , horsham can the scottish executive please ban all those old american movies from my tv where almost everyone smokes e.g. casablanca .
americans are very vociferous about being anti-smoking and yet they do n't take any responsibility for being the cause .
audrey i can not express strongly enough how appalled i am at the legal challenge to the smoking ban being pursued by swallow group .
the ban on smoking in public places does not ban smoking , it simply forces smokers to choose somewhere else to smoke .
to put pub profits before the health of the people of scotland , and to do so unilaterally is very condescending , and to suggest that this ban is being implemented against the wishes of the people is ridiculous .
i for one will be boycotting all swallow group holdings immediately , and i hope this objection is rejected out of hand .
alex holstead , armadale i am in scotland twice a year .
i ca n't wait to be able to go into a pub and not come out stinking ! !
in the past when i have complained about patrons next to me smoking , i have been considered one of those " rude americans " -lrb- although i am much more scottish than american -rrb- .
i ca n't wait ! ! !
anne holladay-wallace , tennessee usa where are all the restaurants that allow smoking ?
non-smokers seem to find them easily enough , but i , as a smoker , only seem to find ones that quite rightly , do n't allow smoking at tables .
some have bars where smoking is permitted , but generally a smoker would need to go outside to enjoy a puff .
i 'm sure most smokers accept the ban is coming soon and probably will be a jolt for a few to quit .
i find in general , non-smokers have been on the rampage over the last few months in the media .
there are far more considerate smokers than inconsiderate ones in my view , who happily freeze half to death for their fix , but as usual we are all tarred with the same filter tipped brush .

i speak as an asthma suffering ex-smoker , living in lerwick , who is unable to go out to pubs because of the fog of cigarette smoke .
i am definitely no reformed smoker , preferring instead to try to educate those smokers around me who poison themselves first and the rest of us second .
the ban has been well advertised , but still many establishments are holding out to the last moment until they impose the ban , rather than grasping the nettle , protecting their staff and letting the rest of us , the majority , have an evening out without returning home with foul smelling clothes and hair through the effects of cigarette smoke .
i am unable to understand the logic of the owners of these establishments , who believe that their profits will be reduced if they ban smoking .
that is obviously completely wrong .
there are more non-smokers now than smokers and i constantly hear my friends bemoaning the way their evening out is spoilt by cigarette smoke .
you ca n't even stand in the bus shelter outside the hospital in lerwick as it is full of nhs smokers dying for another fix .
the views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and are not endorsed by the bbc .
we asked for your views on the ban .
the following represents the balance of opinion we received .
i put all my clothes in the wash after a night out regardless if i 've been in a smoky atmosphere or not .
you non smokers must be a smelly lot .
pl , aberdeen the cigarettes i smoke are legally imported , legally bought , tax paid and in other words , fully endorsed by this government and all before it .
tobacco will not be made illegal , it generates too much revenue , and to illegalise it would be paydirt to organised crime .
furthermore , the tobacco companies remain highly successful and profitable for its shareholders , i wonder how many anti-smokers even check if their endowments , pension funds etc are invested in some measure in these companies ?
the smell of my cigarettes is nothing to the stench of hypocrisy emanating from the proponents of this ban .
liz barber , stockton on tees , england i read the news from scotland every morning and every evening .
i admire the people of my ancestral home .
i know that you are all concerned about education , crime , and tolls on the forth road bridge .
none the less , i am so impressed with the incredible amount of progress that scotland has made since 1999 when the scottish parliament first sat .
please understand that in the us , we ca n't even approve a garden plan in that amount of time .
as to the smoking ban , i have been waiting for such a ban to happen here in philadelphia .
i am so eager to go out and enjoy the pubs and a nice pint .
i ca n't with all the smoke .
i have tried to get owners to do a smoke free night , or even a smoke free room , and they all fiercely refused .
i now go up to new york when i want to go out .
perhaps , some people will stay home and just drink beer in their living room so they can smoke , that 's fine .
it means they wo n't drink-drive .
but , people like me will be standing in ready to take their place at the bar .
the one thing i do n't understand is why no-one has approved the idea of a good smoking lounge in pubs .
think about it , a nice room with a double airlock door , and separate ventilation system .
smokers could go in there and smoke , drink , and still come out and join up with other friends .
i 'd have no problems with that .
j nathan , philadelphia i can not understand for the life of me how people can object to the smoking ban .
the ban is not on smoking but smoking is public place .
i do n't think people should take it personally .
i myself ca n't wait for the ban .
as a non smoker i feel i have a right to enjoy going to a pub or restaurant without having to breathe in other people 's smoke .
people who smoke have a choice .
but those who do n't smoke do not .
we have to breathe in second hand smoke whether we like it or not .
we could go to a non smoking pub , but then why should our freedom to choose be taken away from us by a minority .
i do not think the ban will have a big financial impact on the pub trade , although i suspect firms may use it as an excuse to increase prices .
but then if it is going to save lives it 's worth it .
if you want to smoke then on you go , but please let those that do n't live their lives free from your poisonous fumes .
