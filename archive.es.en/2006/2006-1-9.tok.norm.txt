it calls for boosting the council 's membership from the current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats with no veto power - one for each of the g4 members plus two for the african region - and four new non-permanent seats . but the text met stiff opposition from the united states and china , both permanent veto-wielding members of the council along with britain , france and russia . japan to draw up own proposal while advocating unity japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to washington , its main ally , for securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council .

japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . " we are in serious dialogue with the united states and we are hoping we will be able to come up with a new plan that they can support , " iida said .
" we need us support on a specific plan .
then we will go to the other g4 members and negotiate with them . " " we need both the us and the g4 on board to make council reform happen .
this is a very difficult task , " he said . while washington made it clear last year it supported japan 's bid for permanent council membership , it also adamantly opposed the joint g4 bid . asked why japan was not trying to woo china as well , iida replied : " the us has been forthcoming on un reform and has supported japan 's bid .
this is not the case with china . " " we have started a dialogue with the chinese as well but the discussions with the chinese are fundamentally and substantively different from what we are doing with the americans , " he said . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to join this time , the other three g4 members would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . germany sees japan as " straying from the group " and a german diplomat said tokyo 's g4 partners did not consider that " japan has strayed from the group .

we see it as a way of burden-sharing .

" however the g4 is the driving force behind security council reform and we need the g4 countries to cooperate together .

it calls for boosting the council 's membership from the current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats with no veto power - one for each of the g4 members plus two for the african region - and four new non-permanent seats . but the text met stiff opposition from the united states and china , both permanent veto-wielding members of the council along with britain , france and russia . japan to draw up own proposal while advocating unity japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to washington , its main ally , for securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan is cosying up to the united states - a move that has unsettled its g4 partners .
japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . " we are in serious dialogue with the united states and we are hoping we will be able to come up with a new plan that they can support , " iida said .
" we need us support on a specific plan .
then we will go to the other g4 members and negotiate with them . " " we need both the us and the g4 on board to make council reform happen .
this is a very difficult task , " he said . while washington made it clear last year it supported japan 's bid for permanent council membership , it also adamantly opposed the joint g4 bid . asked why japan was not trying to woo china as well , iida replied : " the us has been forthcoming on un reform and has supported japan 's bid .
this is not the case with china . " " we have started a dialogue with the chinese as well but the discussions with the chinese are fundamentally and substantively different from what we are doing with the americans , " he said . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to join this time , the other three g4 members would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . germany sees japan as " straying from the group " and a german diplomat said tokyo 's g4 partners did not consider that " japan has strayed from the group .
we believe that so far the g4 draft is the best proposal in the sense that it generates the broadest support , " she noted .

asked why the g4 as a group was not trying to enlist us support , the german diplomat replied : " we have also addressed the us but so far they chose to speak to the japanese and that 's fine .
we see it as a way of burden-sharing .
if japan thinks they can get the us on board , that 's great and we would welcome it and we also said we 're open to amendments .
we are not aiming for a vote in the immediate future .
so if these talks generate some positive results , then we might amend the text and broaden the support , " she added . iida said his government also felt that it would have been better for the g4 to wait for the 53-member african union -lrb- au -rrb- to clarify its own stand on security council reform at a planned summit later this month . last october , the au , whose support for the g4 proposal is seen as crucial , renewed its demand for a 26-seat security council .

among other things , ministers will deal with a planned multi-billion investment program . the time has come for germany 's grand coalition to prove that it can really move the country forward .
at the center of the berlin cabinet 's most urgent tasks this year are measures to revive the flagging domestic job market .
unemployment is still only slightly below the five million mark . the difficult task ahead will be to boost consumer spending without losing sight of the larger aim : budget consolidation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is hoping the investment program will help boost construction in their coalition treaty , the christian democratic / christian social union bloc -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and its social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- partner agreed on a special 25 ­ ­ -billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2 billion -rrb- investment program in 2006 to promote employment and growth through more funding for research , improved infrastructure , more support for families and favorable tax treatment for capital investment and home improvement . at their two-day strategy meeting at genshagen castle near berlin , cabinet ministers are hoping to send out a signal of harmony and resolve without sacrificing the profile of the mainstream parties they represent . this in itself seems like squaring the circle .
an added irritation is the fact that some major policy issues have been the subjects of heated debate even within both the spd and the cdu / csu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and angela merkel spd general secretary hubertus heil at the weekend suggested that 25 billion euros for fresh investment would be too little .
but spd labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering hastened to assure the media that the original agreement will remain intact . " i take it that we 'll stick to the 25 billion euros we agreed on in the coalition treaty , " he said .
" we simply have to bear in mind the interests of our finance minister who 's out to consolidate the budget in the medium-term .
the 25 million euros from the state will free more resources in private business .
so , the impact of the investment program will be even bigger . " disagreement over low-wage sector another controversial issue is how to improve conditions for employment in the low-wage sector .
the christian democrats are in favor of granting state subsidies to top up wages and to motivate people to accept relatively low-paid jobs rather than staying at home and living on unemployment benefits . cdu labor affairs spokesman ronald pofalla said he thinks that such a policy makes perfect sense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part-time waiters might benefit from wage subsidies " we believe that the wage subsidies will not turn out to be a major financial burden on state coffers , " he said .
" it 'll be less money than we 'd have to spend otherwise on unemployment benefits . " but social democratic ministers fear that these so-called combined wages could have unforeseeable financial consequences and could lead to a reduction of regular jobs . a nuclear future ? cabinet ministers will also be debating the government 's future energy strategy .
a heated dispute has broken out over whether germany should really phase out nuclear energy completely as decided by the previous government under former chancellor gerhard schröder . the controversy broke out after the recent gas dispute between russia and ukraine fuelled fears about germany 's increased dependence on gas imports from russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in stade in northern germany was the first to be switched off in 2003 conservative economics minister michael glos is among the staunchest supporters of rethinking germany 's nuclear energy policy .
some of his fellow conservatives now even in favor of building new nuclear power plants . these are only some of the issues which are bound to cause some friction at the strategy meeting .
but glos is confident everything can be sorted out in a constructive manner without jeopardizing the governing coalition 's clout .

among other things , ministers will deal with a planned multi-billion investment program . the time has come for germany 's grand coalition to prove that it can really move the country forward .
at the center of the berlin cabinet 's most urgent tasks this year are measures to revive the flagging domestic job market .
unemployment is still only slightly below the five million mark . the difficult task ahead will be to boost consumer spending without losing sight of the larger aim : budget consolidation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is hoping the investment program will help boost construction in their coalition treaty , the christian democratic / christian social union bloc -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and its social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- partner agreed on a special 25 ­ ­ -billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2 billion -rrb- investment program in 2006 to promote employment and growth through more funding for research , improved infrastructure , more support for families and favorable tax treatment for capital investment and home improvement . at their two-day strategy meeting at genshagen castle near berlin , cabinet ministers are hoping to send out a signal of harmony and resolve without sacrificing the profile of the mainstream parties they represent . this in itself seems like squaring the circle .
an added irritation is the fact that some major policy issues have been the subjects of heated debate even within both the spd and the cdu / csu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and angela merkel spd general secretary hubertus heil at the weekend suggested that 25 billion euros for fresh investment would be too little .
but spd labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering hastened to assure the media that the original agreement will remain intact . " i take it that we 'll stick to the 25 billion euros we agreed on in the coalition treaty , " he said .
" we simply have to bear in mind the interests of our finance minister who 's out to consolidate the budget in the medium-term .
the 25 million euros from the state will free more resources in private business .
so , the impact of the investment program will be even bigger . " disagreement over low-wage sector another controversial issue is how to improve conditions for employment in the low-wage sector .
the christian democrats are in favor of granting state subsidies to top up wages and to motivate people to accept relatively low-paid jobs rather than staying at home and living on unemployment benefits . cdu labor affairs spokesman ronald pofalla said he thinks that such a policy makes perfect sense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part-time waiters might benefit from wage subsidies " we believe that the wage subsidies will not turn out to be a major financial burden on state coffers , " he said .
" it 'll be less money than we 'd have to spend otherwise on unemployment benefits . " but social democratic ministers fear that these so-called combined wages could have unforeseeable financial consequences and could lead to a reduction of regular jobs . a nuclear future ? cabinet ministers will also be debating the government 's future energy strategy .
a heated dispute has broken out over whether germany should really phase out nuclear energy completely as decided by the previous government under former chancellor gerhard schröder . the controversy broke out after the recent gas dispute between russia and ukraine fuelled fears about germany 's increased dependence on gas imports from russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in stade in northern germany was the first to be switched off in 2003 conservative economics minister michael glos is among the staunchest supporters of rethinking germany 's nuclear energy policy .

an added irritation is the fact that some major policy issues have been the subjects of heated debate even within both the spd and the cdu / csu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and angela merkel spd general secretary hubertus heil at the weekend suggested that 25 billion euros for fresh investment would be too little .
but spd labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering hastened to assure the media that the original agreement will remain intact . " i take it that we 'll stick to the 25 billion euros we agreed on in the coalition treaty , " he said .
" we simply have to bear in mind the interests of our finance minister who 's out to consolidate the budget in the medium-term .
the 25 million euros from the state will free more resources in private business .
so , the impact of the investment program will be even bigger . " disagreement over low-wage sector another controversial issue is how to improve conditions for employment in the low-wage sector .
the christian democrats are in favor of granting state subsidies to top up wages and to motivate people to accept relatively low-paid jobs rather than staying at home and living on unemployment benefits . cdu labor affairs spokesman ronald pofalla said he thinks that such a policy makes perfect sense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part-time waiters might benefit from wage subsidies " we believe that the wage subsidies will not turn out to be a major financial burden on state coffers , " he said .
" it 'll be less money than we 'd have to spend otherwise on unemployment benefits . " but social democratic ministers fear that these so-called combined wages could have unforeseeable financial consequences and could lead to a reduction of regular jobs . a nuclear future ? cabinet ministers will also be debating the government 's future energy strategy .
a heated dispute has broken out over whether germany should really phase out nuclear energy completely as decided by the previous government under former chancellor gerhard schröder . the controversy broke out after the recent gas dispute between russia and ukraine fuelled fears about germany 's increased dependence on gas imports from russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in stade in northern germany was the first to be switched off in 2003 conservative economics minister michael glos is among the staunchest supporters of rethinking germany 's nuclear energy policy .
some of his fellow conservatives now even in favor of building new nuclear power plants . these are only some of the issues which are bound to cause some friction at the strategy meeting .
but glos is confident everything can be sorted out in a constructive manner without jeopardizing the governing coalition 's clout . " marriages of convenience often last longer than those based on love , " he said . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?

the story of her unprecedented success on the german political scene - part political thriller , part soap opera - should make you think twice before you call somebody a " silly old goose . " while visiting a farm in the german town of lenzen back in 2000 , former chancellor schröder noticed a goose he thought would look pretty nice on his christmas table .
the farm owners were more than happy to accommodate the wishes of their elected leader .
doretta , the goose , received a special ribbon as a mark of distinction among her fellow birds .
she went on cluelessly stuffing herself with whatever food came her way - not knowing , of course , that she was getting her pre-christmas makeover in order to keep the chancellor 's tummy full during the holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta owes her fame to former chancellor schröder and his step daughter klara when schröder , however , went home and told his family about his day , all hell broke loose .
an emergency meeting was convened at the family command room .
due to the sensitivity of the topics discussed , the meeting was closed to the public . but from the information that was leaked to the media , we know that schröder 's stepdaughter klara flatly rejected the chancellor 's report on the goose deal and refused to play any role on the goose slaughtering consortium .
doretta had to be saved . when your stepdad is ruling the country , you do n't take " i ca n't do anything about it " for an answer .
instead , you say " give me a break , daddy .
you 're the chancellor .
just make it happen . " so he did .
doretta , who incidentally turned out to be a gander , but kept proudly using her artistic drag name , was pardoned by the chancellor .
the chancellor 's office sent a yearly appanage for the upkeep of the first first goose in german history .
doretta remained on the farm where she was born , and received just about enough media attention to drive all the other geese mad with jealousy . goosy goosy ga n der , where dost thou wa n der ? life was pretty good for doretta until schröder lost the german elections in sept .
2005 .
after a prolonged and , at times , embarrassing tug-of-war with his conservative rival angela merkel , schröder conceded , and merkel became the first female chancellor in german history .
all of a sudden , doretta was in trouble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former first goose is not a priority on chancellor merkel 's agenda the parliamentary office of the former chancellor stated that the payments for doretta 's upkeep " were limited to -lrb- schröder 's -rrb- chancellorship and would not be continued . " angela merkel 's spokesperson said that doretta was a " topic that frau merkel will not be concerned with . " when asked by tv reporters if she would take over the responsibility of caring for the first goose , angela merkel herself said she believed doretta was " in good hands . " what these statements amount to - once you remove the obfuscating layer of diplomatic lingo - is that everybody was bailing out on poor old doretta . a celebrity for life doretta was , however , meant for more than 15 minutes of fame .
after being described by some analysts as the paris hilton of german geese , doretta is now giving up a life of mindless glamour to get a full-time job with the berlin association " life with animals . "
the organization is a proponent of animal-assisted therapy : it helps people in need improve their physical , social , emotional and cognitive functions by interacting with animals . in other words , no more wild goose chases for this silly old goose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta 's celebrity friends : damon , the dog and fuchs , the cat from the german pet fame academy doretta will go down in history as a controversial , gender-bending first goose , who does n't just live off of its past glory .

the story of her unprecedented success on the german political scene - part political thriller , part soap opera - should make you think twice before you call somebody a " silly old goose . " while visiting a farm in the german town of lenzen back in 2000 , former chancellor schröder noticed a goose he thought would look pretty nice on his christmas table .
the farm owners were more than happy to accommodate the wishes of their elected leader .
doretta , the goose , received a special ribbon as a mark of distinction among her fellow birds .
she went on cluelessly stuffing herself with whatever food came her way - not knowing , of course , that she was getting her pre-christmas makeover in order to keep the chancellor 's tummy full during the holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta owes her fame to former chancellor schröder and his step daughter klara when schröder , however , went home and told his family about his day , all hell broke loose .
an emergency meeting was convened at the family command room .
due to the sensitivity of the topics discussed , the meeting was closed to the public . but from the information that was leaked to the media , we know that schröder 's stepdaughter klara flatly rejected the chancellor 's report on the goose deal and refused to play any role on the goose slaughtering consortium .
doretta had to be saved . when your stepdad is ruling the country , you do n't take " i ca n't do anything about it " for an answer .
instead , you say " give me a break , daddy .
you 're the chancellor .
just make it happen . " so he did .
doretta , who incidentally turned out to be a gander , but kept proudly using her artistic drag name , was pardoned by the chancellor .
the chancellor 's office sent a yearly appanage for the upkeep of the first first goose in german history .
doretta remained on the farm where she was born , and received just about enough media attention to drive all the other geese mad with jealousy . goosy goosy ga n der , where dost thou wa n der ? life was pretty good for doretta until schröder lost the german elections in sept .
2005 .
after a prolonged and , at times , embarrassing tug-of-war with his conservative rival angela merkel , schröder conceded , and merkel became the first female chancellor in german history .
all of a sudden , doretta was in trouble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former first goose is not a priority on chancellor merkel 's agenda the parliamentary office of the former chancellor stated that the payments for doretta 's upkeep " were limited to -lrb- schröder 's -rrb- chancellorship and would not be continued . " angela merkel 's spokesperson said that doretta was a " topic that frau merkel will not be concerned with . " when asked by tv reporters if she would take over the responsibility of caring for the first goose , angela merkel herself said she believed doretta was " in good hands . " what these statements amount to - once you remove the obfuscating layer of diplomatic lingo - is that everybody was bailing out on poor old doretta . a celebrity for life doretta was , however , meant for more than 15 minutes of fame .
after being described by some analysts as the paris hilton of german geese , doretta is now giving up a life of mindless glamour to get a full-time job with the berlin association " life with animals . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.01.2006 when not working is the best option großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more money to take on low-paying work how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?
government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .
economic black holes but the debate wo n't go away .
providing german citizens with some form of basic financial support is the government ’ s constitutional mandate .
at the moment , a modified version is in place nationally .
around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there enough room in the budget to finance low-paying jobs ?
but the current debate is almost as confusing as the byzantine models tested by various german states in the past , say experts , adding that the government - although on the right track - needs to get its facts straight .

government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .
economic black holes but the debate wo n't go away .
providing german citizens with some form of basic financial support is the government ’ s constitutional mandate .
at the moment , a modified version is in place nationally .
around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .

but observers believe activity is set to pick up sharply this year .
top think-tanks such as ifo in munich and diw in berlin have both recently sharply upgraded their 2006 growth forecasts to 1.7 percent . and the government , which was hitherto expecting a modest 1.2 percent , now believes growth will be in a range of 1.5-1.8 percent , economy minister michael glos indicated last week . berlin is scheduled to publish its latest updated growth forecasts on jan .
25 . " we 're sensing an upturn in the economy , " glos said on the sidelines of a working meeting of his conservative csu party in wildbad kreuth in bavaria . a favorable global economic environment is also expected to have a positive effect on the domestic german economy . in an interview with euro am sonntag newspaper , the head of the economics department of the influential german ifo institute , gebhard flaig , said he was even expecting " growth of 1.5-2.0 percent " this year . germany could see a new economic peak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy could reach new heights in the next two years .
indeed , germany could be on the way to reaching " a new economic peak " in the next two years , if the government pressed ahead with the much-needed structural reforms , flaig said . exports are traditionally the main driver of growth in germany and the bga exporters ' federation said this week that exports were likely to expand by 8 percent this year after increasing by 7 percent in 2005 . but the spark of recovery is also expected to jump over to domestic demand , traditionally the achilles ' heel of german growth , experts believe .
in its regular monthly consumer sentiment survey last month , the market research group gfk found that german households were more willing now than they have been in the past four years to go out and spend money . that will come as good news for the retail sector , where business has declined for the past three years and looks to have stagnated in 2005 . labor market conditions also looking rosier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sweet smell of better employment conditions .
conditions in the labor market also appear to be improving - the jobless rate fell to 11.2 percent in december from 11.4 percent in november in seasonally adjusted terms , data showed last week . and in raw or unadjusted terms , the number of people on unemployment benefits increased by just 75,000 to 4.606 million last month , the slowest level increase since unification . indeed , the federal labor agency believes the jobless total could remain below the politically sensitive level of five million in the winter months . caution urged over one-off economic boosts however , some observers believe the positive economic developments will prove short-lived , since they appear to be driven primarily by one-off factors , such as the upcoming world cup soccer championship and a 25-billion-euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- public investment program by the government . furthermore , the new government under chancellor angela merkel has said it will raise value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19.0 percent at the beginning of 2007 , which could dampen fragile consumer spending . much of consumers ' apparent new-found willingness to spend reflects plans to bring forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the vat rise , experts say . thus , " the economy risks slipping back into its old lethargy at the start of next year , " diw think tank warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth .

indeed , germany could be on the way to reaching " a new economic peak " in the next two years , if the government pressed ahead with the much-needed structural reforms , flaig said . exports are traditionally the main driver of growth in germany and the bga exporters ' federation said this week that exports were likely to expand by 8 percent this year after increasing by 7 percent in 2005 . but the spark of recovery is also expected to jump over to domestic demand , traditionally the achilles ' heel of german growth , experts believe .

government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .
economic black holes but the debate wo n't go away .
providing german citizens with some form of basic financial support is the government ’ s constitutional mandate .
at the moment , a modified version is in place nationally .
around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there enough room in the budget to finance low-paying jobs ?
but the current debate is almost as confusing as the byzantine models tested by various german states in the past , say experts , adding that the government - although on the right track - needs to get its facts straight .
" we 've had a few models from which we 've learned , " spermann said .
" but it does n't seem like the politicians are aware of them at the moment .

government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .
economic black holes but the debate wo n't go away .
providing german citizens with some form of basic financial support is the government ’ s constitutional mandate .
at the moment , a modified version is in place nationally .
around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there enough room in the budget to finance low-paying jobs ?
but the current debate is almost as confusing as the byzantine models tested by various german states in the past , say experts , adding that the government - although on the right track - needs to get its facts straight .
" we 've had a few models from which we 've learned , " spermann said .
" but it does n't seem like the politicians are aware of them at the moment .

" we do not believe the g4 draft in its current form can garner the necessary support , " he added .
" however the g4 is the driving force behind security council reform and we need the g4 countries to cooperate together . " the latest draft submitted to the un secretariat is similar to one already presented last year by brazil , germany , india and japan which failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the un general assembly .
it calls for boosting the council 's membership from the current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats with no veto power - one for each of the g4 members plus two for the african region - and four new non-permanent seats . but the text met stiff opposition from the united states and china , both permanent veto-wielding members of the council along with britain , france and russia . japan to draw up own proposal while advocating unity japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to washington , its main ally , for securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan is cosying up to the united states - a move that has unsettled its g4 partners .
japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . " we are in serious dialogue with the united states and we are hoping we will be able to come up with a new plan that they can support , " iida said .
" we need us support on a specific plan .
then we will go to the other g4 members and negotiate with them . " " we need both the us and the g4 on board to make council reform happen .
this is a very difficult task , " he said . while washington made it clear last year it supported japan 's bid for permanent council membership , it also adamantly opposed the joint g4 bid . asked why japan was not trying to woo china as well , iida replied : " the us has been forthcoming on un reform and has supported japan 's bid .
this is not the case with china . " " we have started a dialogue with the chinese as well but the discussions with the chinese are fundamentally and substantively different from what we are doing with the americans , " he said . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to join this time , the other three g4 members would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . germany sees japan as " straying from the group " and a german diplomat said tokyo 's g4 partners did not consider that " japan has strayed from the group .
we believe that so far the g4 draft is the best proposal in the sense that it generates the broadest support , " she noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will enter the un debate started by his predecessor .
asked why the g4 as a group was not trying to enlist us support , the german diplomat replied : " we have also addressed the us but so far they chose to speak to the japanese and that 's fine .
we see it as a way of burden-sharing .

" there is a clear distinction between the g4 draft resolution and the g4 cooperative framework , " shinichi iida , first secretary at japan 's un mission , told afp .
" we do not believe the g4 draft in its current form can garner the necessary support , " he added .
" however the g4 is the driving force behind security council reform and we need the g4 countries to cooperate together . " the latest draft submitted to the un secretariat is similar to one already presented last year by brazil , germany , india and japan which failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the un general assembly .
it calls for boosting the council 's membership from the current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats with no veto power - one for each of the g4 members plus two for the african region - and four new non-permanent seats . but the text met stiff opposition from the united states and china , both permanent veto-wielding members of the council along with britain , france and russia . japan to draw up own proposal while advocating unity japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to washington , its main ally , for securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan is cosying up to the united states - a move that has unsettled its g4 partners .
japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . " we are in serious dialogue with the united states and we are hoping we will be able to come up with a new plan that they can support , " iida said .
" we need us support on a specific plan .
then we will go to the other g4 members and negotiate with them . " " we need both the us and the g4 on board to make council reform happen .
this is a very difficult task , " he said . while washington made it clear last year it supported japan 's bid for permanent council membership , it also adamantly opposed the joint g4 bid . asked why japan was not trying to woo china as well , iida replied : " the us has been forthcoming on un reform and has supported japan 's bid .
this is not the case with china . " " we have started a dialogue with the chinese as well but the discussions with the chinese are fundamentally and substantively different from what we are doing with the americans , " he said . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to join this time , the other three g4 members would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . germany sees japan as " straying from the group " and a german diplomat said tokyo 's g4 partners did not consider that " japan has strayed from the group .
we believe that so far the g4 draft is the best proposal in the sense that it generates the broadest support , " she noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will enter the un debate started by his predecessor .
asked why the g4 as a group was not trying to enlist us support , the german diplomat replied : " we have also addressed the us but so far they chose to speak to the japanese and that 's fine .
we see it as a way of burden-sharing .
if japan thinks they can get the us on board , that 's great and we would welcome it and we also said we 're open to amendments .
we are not aiming for a vote in the immediate future .
so if these talks generate some positive results , then we might amend the text and broaden the support , " she added . iida said his government also felt that it would have been better for the g4 to wait for the 53-member african union -lrb- au -rrb- to clarify its own stand on security council reform at a planned summit later this month . last october , the au , whose support for the g4 proposal is seen as crucial , renewed its demand for a 26-seat security council .
under this scenario , africa would get two of six new permanent seats with veto power as well as two of five new non-permanent seats . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de japan gives up joint g4 bid to reform un security council with japan 's decision to pursue permanent membership on the un security council without its g4 allies , the prospects of germany joining the big guys in the top un body are looking less rosy than ever .

the story of her unprecedented success on the german political scene - part political thriller , part soap opera - should make you think twice before you call somebody a " silly old goose . " while visiting a farm in the german town of lenzen back in 2000 , former chancellor schröder noticed a goose he thought would look pretty nice on his christmas table .
the farm owners were more than happy to accommodate the wishes of their elected leader .
doretta , the goose , received a special ribbon as a mark of distinction among her fellow birds .
she went on cluelessly stuffing herself with whatever food came her way - not knowing , of course , that she was getting her pre-christmas makeover in order to keep the chancellor 's tummy full during the holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta owes her fame to former chancellor schröder and his step daughter klara when schröder , however , went home and told his family about his day , all hell broke loose .
an emergency meeting was convened at the family command room .
due to the sensitivity of the topics discussed , the meeting was closed to the public . but from the information that was leaked to the media , we know that schröder 's stepdaughter klara flatly rejected the chancellor 's report on the goose deal and refused to play any role on the goose slaughtering consortium .
doretta had to be saved . when your stepdad is ruling the country , you do n't take " i ca n't do anything about it " for an answer .
instead , you say " give me a break , daddy .
you 're the chancellor .

doretta , who incidentally turned out to be a gander , but kept proudly using her artistic drag name , was pardoned by the chancellor .
the chancellor 's office sent a yearly appanage for the upkeep of the first first goose in german history .
doretta remained on the farm where she was born , and received just about enough media attention to drive all the other geese mad with jealousy . goosy goosy ga n der , where dost thou wa n der ? life was pretty good for doretta until schröder lost the german elections in sept .
2005 .

" when asked by tv reporters if she would take over the responsibility of caring for the first goose , angela merkel herself said she believed doretta was " in good hands . " what these statements amount to - once you remove the obfuscating layer of diplomatic lingo - is that everybody was bailing out on poor old doretta . a celebrity for life doretta was , however , meant for more than 15 minutes of fame .
after being described by some analysts as the paris hilton of german geese , doretta is now giving up a life of mindless glamour to get a full-time job with the berlin association " life with animals . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.01.2006 government retreats to re-think germany 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " red " and " black " members of government get cozy in genshagen the german government is holding a two-day strategy meeting meant to bring both sides of the " grand coalition " into harmony .
among other things , ministers will deal with a planned multi-billion investment program . the time has come for germany 's grand coalition to prove that it can really move the country forward .
at the center of the berlin cabinet 's most urgent tasks this year are measures to revive the flagging domestic job market .
unemployment is still only slightly below the five million mark . the difficult task ahead will be to boost consumer spending without losing sight of the larger aim : budget consolidation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is hoping the investment program will help boost construction in their coalition treaty , the christian democratic / christian social union bloc -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and its social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- partner agreed on a special 25 ­ ­ -billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2 billion -rrb- investment program in 2006 to promote employment and growth through more funding for research , improved infrastructure , more support for families and favorable tax treatment for capital investment and home improvement . at their two-day strategy meeting at genshagen castle near berlin , cabinet ministers are hoping to send out a signal of harmony and resolve without sacrificing the profile of the mainstream parties they represent . this in itself seems like squaring the circle .
an added irritation is the fact that some major policy issues have been the subjects of heated debate even within both the spd and the cdu / csu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and angela merkel spd general secretary hubertus heil at the weekend suggested that 25 billion euros for fresh investment would be too little .
but spd labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering hastened to assure the media that the original agreement will remain intact . " i take it that we 'll stick to the 25 billion euros we agreed on in the coalition treaty , " he said .
" we simply have to bear in mind the interests of our finance minister who 's out to consolidate the budget in the medium-term .
the 25 million euros from the state will free more resources in private business .
so , the impact of the investment program will be even bigger . " disagreement over low-wage sector another controversial issue is how to improve conditions for employment in the low-wage sector .
the christian democrats are in favor of granting state subsidies to top up wages and to motivate people to accept relatively low-paid jobs rather than staying at home and living on unemployment benefits . cdu labor affairs spokesman ronald pofalla said he thinks that such a policy makes perfect sense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part-time waiters might benefit from wage subsidies " we believe that the wage subsidies will not turn out to be a major financial burden on state coffers , " he said .
" it 'll be less money than we 'd have to spend otherwise on unemployment benefits . " but social democratic ministers fear that these so-called combined wages could have unforeseeable financial consequences and could lead to a reduction of regular jobs . a nuclear future ? cabinet ministers will also be debating the government 's future energy strategy .
a heated dispute has broken out over whether germany should really phase out nuclear energy completely as decided by the previous government under former chancellor gerhard schröder . the controversy broke out after the recent gas dispute between russia and ukraine fuelled fears about germany 's increased dependence on gas imports from russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in stade in northern germany was the first to be switched off in 2003 conservative economics minister michael glos is among the staunchest supporters of rethinking germany 's nuclear energy policy .
some of his fellow conservatives now even in favor of building new nuclear power plants . these are only some of the issues which are bound to cause some friction at the strategy meeting .
but glos is confident everything can be sorted out in a constructive manner without jeopardizing the governing coalition 's clout . " marriages of convenience often last longer than those based on love , " he said . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?
government politicians say they have the answer .

among other things , ministers will deal with a planned multi-billion investment program . the time has come for germany 's grand coalition to prove that it can really move the country forward .
at the center of the berlin cabinet 's most urgent tasks this year are measures to revive the flagging domestic job market .
unemployment is still only slightly below the five million mark . the difficult task ahead will be to boost consumer spending without losing sight of the larger aim : budget consolidation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is hoping the investment program will help boost construction in their coalition treaty , the christian democratic / christian social union bloc -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and its social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- partner agreed on a special 25 ­ ­ -billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2 billion -rrb- investment program in 2006 to promote employment and growth through more funding for research , improved infrastructure , more support for families and favorable tax treatment for capital investment and home improvement . at their two-day strategy meeting at genshagen castle near berlin , cabinet ministers are hoping to send out a signal of harmony and resolve without sacrificing the profile of the mainstream parties they represent . this in itself seems like squaring the circle .
an added irritation is the fact that some major policy issues have been the subjects of heated debate even within both the spd and the cdu / csu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and angela merkel spd general secretary hubertus heil at the weekend suggested that 25 billion euros for fresh investment would be too little .
but spd labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering hastened to assure the media that the original agreement will remain intact . " i take it that we 'll stick to the 25 billion euros we agreed on in the coalition treaty , " he said .
" we simply have to bear in mind the interests of our finance minister who 's out to consolidate the budget in the medium-term .
the 25 million euros from the state will free more resources in private business .
so , the impact of the investment program will be even bigger . " disagreement over low-wage sector another controversial issue is how to improve conditions for employment in the low-wage sector .
the christian democrats are in favor of granting state subsidies to top up wages and to motivate people to accept relatively low-paid jobs rather than staying at home and living on unemployment benefits . cdu labor affairs spokesman ronald pofalla said he thinks that such a policy makes perfect sense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part-time waiters might benefit from wage subsidies " we believe that the wage subsidies will not turn out to be a major financial burden on state coffers , " he said .
" it 'll be less money than we 'd have to spend otherwise on unemployment benefits . " but social democratic ministers fear that these so-called combined wages could have unforeseeable financial consequences and could lead to a reduction of regular jobs . a nuclear future ? cabinet ministers will also be debating the government 's future energy strategy .
a heated dispute has broken out over whether germany should really phase out nuclear energy completely as decided by the previous government under former chancellor gerhard schröder . the controversy broke out after the recent gas dispute between russia and ukraine fuelled fears about germany 's increased dependence on gas imports from russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in stade in northern germany was the first to be switched off in 2003 conservative economics minister michael glos is among the staunchest supporters of rethinking germany 's nuclear energy policy .
some of his fellow conservatives now even in favor of building new nuclear power plants . these are only some of the issues which are bound to cause some friction at the strategy meeting .
but glos is confident everything can be sorted out in a constructive manner without jeopardizing the governing coalition 's clout . " marriages of convenience often last longer than those based on love , " he said . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?

france joined in the criticism . iran 's decision to resume nuclear research marks a breach of its international commitments and " can not remain without consequence , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on monday . steinmeier said berlin would this week discuss iran 's latest step with france and britain , the other two countries that form the european troika negotiating with tehran on its controversial nuclear program . " this marks a breach of tehran 's commitments ...
it can not remain without consequence , " for the troika , steinmeier said on the sidelines of a meeting of the german cabinet in genshagen , outside berlin .

" we urge iran to immediately and unconditionally reverse its decision , " douste-blazy told a joint press conference with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who warned that the situation was " serious . " the minister said that france , which along with britain and germany has been leading tortuous negotiations with iran on its nuclear program , was " very seriously concerned " by tehran 's decision . talks broke off an iranian government spokesman confirmed on monday that the islamic republic would resume nuclear research activities the same day .

they were due to resume in a month . germany 's steinmeier said he planned to speak to russian foreign minister sergei lavrov later monday about tehran 's decision . blowing hot and cold moscow has been proposing that tehran carry out uranium enrichment on russian territory to allay western fears that the technology could allow iran to produce a nuclear bomb .
both the european union and the united states have backed the proposal in principle . but in recent weeks , iranian officials have blown hot and cold about the proposed compromise , first suggesting that they might consider it and then insisting that they would do so only if any deal explicitly recognized its right to carry out enrichment on iranian soil . europe has warned that a resumption of research at facilities in iran , which would end a two-year suspension , would jeopardize future talks on ending the crisis with the west over iran 's nuclear activities .
the talks were broken off last august . our of patience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khamenei says iran has a right to nuclear technology germany , france and britain have been trying for over two years to persuade iran to abandon its uranium enrichment program , which could be used to make atom bomb fuel .

government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .
economic black holes but the debate wo n't go away .
providing german citizens with some form of basic financial support is the government ’ s constitutional mandate .
at the moment , a modified version is in place nationally .
around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .

but the current debate is almost as confusing as the byzantine models tested by various german states in the past , say experts , adding that the government - although on the right track - needs to get its facts straight .

the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .
economic black holes but the debate wo n't go away .
providing german citizens with some form of basic financial support is the government ’ s constitutional mandate .
at the moment , a modified version is in place nationally .
around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there enough room in the budget to finance low-paying jobs ?
but the current debate is almost as confusing as the byzantine models tested by various german states in the past , say experts , adding that the government - although on the right track - needs to get its facts straight .
" we 've had a few models from which we 've learned , " spermann said .
" but it does n't seem like the politicians are aware of them at the moment .

but observers believe activity is set to pick up sharply this year .
top think-tanks such as ifo in munich and diw in berlin have both recently sharply upgraded their 2006 growth forecasts to 1.7 percent . and the government , which was hitherto expecting a modest 1.2 percent , now believes growth will be in a range of 1.5-1.8 percent , economy minister michael glos indicated last week . berlin is scheduled to publish its latest updated growth forecasts on jan .
25 . " we 're sensing an upturn in the economy , " glos said on the sidelines of a working meeting of his conservative csu party in wildbad kreuth in bavaria . a favorable global economic environment is also expected to have a positive effect on the domestic german economy . in an interview with euro am sonntag newspaper , the head of the economics department of the influential german ifo institute , gebhard flaig , said he was even expecting " growth of 1.5-2.0 percent " this year . germany could see a new economic peak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy could reach new heights in the next two years .
indeed , germany could be on the way to reaching " a new economic peak " in the next two years , if the government pressed ahead with the much-needed structural reforms , flaig said . exports are traditionally the main driver of growth in germany and the bga exporters ' federation said this week that exports were likely to expand by 8 percent this year after increasing by 7 percent in 2005 . but the spark of recovery is also expected to jump over to domestic demand , traditionally the achilles ' heel of german growth , experts believe .
in its regular monthly consumer sentiment survey last month , the market research group gfk found that german households were more willing now than they have been in the past four years to go out and spend money . that will come as good news for the retail sector , where business has declined for the past three years and looks to have stagnated in 2005 . labor market conditions also looking rosier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sweet smell of better employment conditions .
conditions in the labor market also appear to be improving - the jobless rate fell to 11.2 percent in december from 11.4 percent in november in seasonally adjusted terms , data showed last week . and in raw or unadjusted terms , the number of people on unemployment benefits increased by just 75,000 to 4.606 million last month , the slowest level increase since unification . indeed , the federal labor agency believes the jobless total could remain below the politically sensitive level of five million in the winter months . caution urged over one-off economic boosts however , some observers believe the positive economic developments will prove short-lived , since they appear to be driven primarily by one-off factors , such as the upcoming world cup soccer championship and a 25-billion-euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- public investment program by the government . furthermore , the new government under chancellor angela merkel has said it will raise value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19.0 percent at the beginning of 2007 , which could dampen fragile consumer spending . much of consumers ' apparent new-found willingness to spend reflects plans to bring forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the vat rise , experts say . thus , " the economy risks slipping back into its old lethargy at the start of next year , " diw think tank warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth .

but observers believe activity is set to pick up sharply this year .
top think-tanks such as ifo in munich and diw in berlin have both recently sharply upgraded their 2006 growth forecasts to 1.7 percent . and the government , which was hitherto expecting a modest 1.2 percent , now believes growth will be in a range of 1.5-1.8 percent , economy minister michael glos indicated last week . berlin is scheduled to publish its latest updated growth forecasts on jan .
25 . " we 're sensing an upturn in the economy , " glos said on the sidelines of a working meeting of his conservative csu party in wildbad kreuth in bavaria . a favorable global economic environment is also expected to have a positive effect on the domestic german economy . in an interview with euro am sonntag newspaper , the head of the economics department of the influential german ifo institute , gebhard flaig , said he was even expecting " growth of 1.5-2.0 percent " this year . germany could see a new economic peak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy could reach new heights in the next two years .
indeed , germany could be on the way to reaching " a new economic peak " in the next two years , if the government pressed ahead with the much-needed structural reforms , flaig said . exports are traditionally the main driver of growth in germany and the bga exporters ' federation said this week that exports were likely to expand by 8 percent this year after increasing by 7 percent in 2005 . but the spark of recovery is also expected to jump over to domestic demand , traditionally the achilles ' heel of german growth , experts believe .
in its regular monthly consumer sentiment survey last month , the market research group gfk found that german households were more willing now than they have been in the past four years to go out and spend money . that will come as good news for the retail sector , where business has declined for the past three years and looks to have stagnated in 2005 . labor market conditions also looking rosier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sweet smell of better employment conditions .
conditions in the labor market also appear to be improving - the jobless rate fell to 11.2 percent in december from 11.4 percent in november in seasonally adjusted terms , data showed last week . and in raw or unadjusted terms , the number of people on unemployment benefits increased by just 75,000 to 4.606 million last month , the slowest level increase since unification . indeed , the federal labor agency believes the jobless total could remain below the politically sensitive level of five million in the winter months . caution urged over one-off economic boosts however , some observers believe the positive economic developments will prove short-lived , since they appear to be driven primarily by one-off factors , such as the upcoming world cup soccer championship and a 25-billion-euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- public investment program by the government . furthermore , the new government under chancellor angela merkel has said it will raise value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19.0 percent at the beginning of 2007 , which could dampen fragile consumer spending . much of consumers ' apparent new-found willingness to spend reflects plans to bring forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the vat rise , experts say . thus , " the economy risks slipping back into its old lethargy at the start of next year , " diw think tank warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth .

the story of her unprecedented success on the german political scene - part political thriller , part soap opera - should make you think twice before you call somebody a " silly old goose . " while visiting a farm in the german town of lenzen back in 2000 , former chancellor schröder noticed a goose he thought would look pretty nice on his christmas table .
the farm owners were more than happy to accommodate the wishes of their elected leader .
doretta , the goose , received a special ribbon as a mark of distinction among her fellow birds .
she went on cluelessly stuffing herself with whatever food came her way - not knowing , of course , that she was getting her pre-christmas makeover in order to keep the chancellor 's tummy full during the holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta owes her fame to former chancellor schröder and his step daughter klara when schröder , however , went home and told his family about his day , all hell broke loose .
an emergency meeting was convened at the family command room .
due to the sensitivity of the topics discussed , the meeting was closed to the public . but from the information that was leaked to the media , we know that schröder 's stepdaughter klara flatly rejected the chancellor 's report on the goose deal and refused to play any role on the goose slaughtering consortium .
doretta had to be saved . when your stepdad is ruling the country , you do n't take " i ca n't do anything about it " for an answer .
instead , you say " give me a break , daddy .

doretta , who incidentally turned out to be a gander , but kept proudly using her artistic drag name , was pardoned by the chancellor .

" when asked by tv reporters if she would take over the responsibility of caring for the first goose , angela merkel herself said she believed doretta was " in good hands . " what these statements amount to - once you remove the obfuscating layer of diplomatic lingo - is that everybody was bailing out on poor old doretta . a celebrity for life doretta was , however , meant for more than 15 minutes of fame .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.01.2006 when not working is the best option großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more money to take on low-paying work how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?
government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .
economic black holes but the debate wo n't go away .
providing german citizens with some form of basic financial support is the government ’ s constitutional mandate .
at the moment , a modified version is in place nationally .
around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .

government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .
economic black holes but the debate wo n't go away .
providing german citizens with some form of basic financial support is the government ’ s constitutional mandate .
at the moment , a modified version is in place nationally .
around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .
economic black holes but the debate wo n't go away .
providing german citizens with some form of basic financial support is the government ’ s constitutional mandate .
at the moment , a modified version is in place nationally .
around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there enough room in the budget to finance low-paying jobs ?
but the current debate is almost as confusing as the byzantine models tested by various german states in the past , say experts , adding that the government - although on the right track - needs to get its facts straight .
" we 've had a few models from which we 've learned , " spermann said .
" but it does n't seem like the politicians are aware of them at the moment .

" there is a clear distinction between the g4 draft resolution and the g4 cooperative framework , " shinichi iida , first secretary at japan 's un mission , told afp .
" we do not believe the g4 draft in its current form can garner the necessary support , " he added .
" however the g4 is the driving force behind security council reform and we need the g4 countries to cooperate together . " the latest draft submitted to the un secretariat is similar to one already presented last year by brazil , germany , india and japan which failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the un general assembly .
it calls for boosting the council 's membership from the current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats with no veto power - one for each of the g4 members plus two for the african region - and four new non-permanent seats . but the text met stiff opposition from the united states and china , both permanent veto-wielding members of the council along with britain , france and russia . japan to draw up own proposal while advocating unity japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to washington , its main ally , for securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council .

japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . " we are in serious dialogue with the united states and we are hoping we will be able to come up with a new plan that they can support , " iida said .
" we need us support on a specific plan .
then we will go to the other g4 members and negotiate with them . " " we need both the us and the g4 on board to make council reform happen .
this is a very difficult task , " he said . while washington made it clear last year it supported japan 's bid for permanent council membership , it also adamantly opposed the joint g4 bid . asked why japan was not trying to woo china as well , iida replied : " the us has been forthcoming on un reform and has supported japan 's bid .
this is not the case with china . " " we have started a dialogue with the chinese as well but the discussions with the chinese are fundamentally and substantively different from what we are doing with the americans , " he said . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to join this time , the other three g4 members would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . germany sees japan as " straying from the group " and a german diplomat said tokyo 's g4 partners did not consider that " japan has strayed from the group .

but observers believe activity is set to pick up sharply this year .
top think-tanks such as ifo in munich and diw in berlin have both recently sharply upgraded their 2006 growth forecasts to 1.7 percent . and the government , which was hitherto expecting a modest 1.2 percent , now believes growth will be in a range of 1.5-1.8 percent , economy minister michael glos indicated last week . berlin is scheduled to publish its latest updated growth forecasts on jan .
25 . " we 're sensing an upturn in the economy , " glos said on the sidelines of a working meeting of his conservative csu party in wildbad kreuth in bavaria . a favorable global economic environment is also expected to have a positive effect on the domestic german economy . in an interview with euro am sonntag newspaper , the head of the economics department of the influential german ifo institute , gebhard flaig , said he was even expecting " growth of 1.5-2.0 percent " this year . germany could see a new economic peak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy could reach new heights in the next two years .
indeed , germany could be on the way to reaching " a new economic peak " in the next two years , if the government pressed ahead with the much-needed structural reforms , flaig said . exports are traditionally the main driver of growth in germany and the bga exporters ' federation said this week that exports were likely to expand by 8 percent this year after increasing by 7 percent in 2005 . but the spark of recovery is also expected to jump over to domestic demand , traditionally the achilles ' heel of german growth , experts believe .
in its regular monthly consumer sentiment survey last month , the market research group gfk found that german households were more willing now than they have been in the past four years to go out and spend money . that will come as good news for the retail sector , where business has declined for the past three years and looks to have stagnated in 2005 . labor market conditions also looking rosier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sweet smell of better employment conditions .
conditions in the labor market also appear to be improving - the jobless rate fell to 11.2 percent in december from 11.4 percent in november in seasonally adjusted terms , data showed last week . and in raw or unadjusted terms , the number of people on unemployment benefits increased by just 75,000 to 4.606 million last month , the slowest level increase since unification . indeed , the federal labor agency believes the jobless total could remain below the politically sensitive level of five million in the winter months . caution urged over one-off economic boosts however , some observers believe the positive economic developments will prove short-lived , since they appear to be driven primarily by one-off factors , such as the upcoming world cup soccer championship and a 25-billion-euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- public investment program by the government . furthermore , the new government under chancellor angela merkel has said it will raise value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19.0 percent at the beginning of 2007 , which could dampen fragile consumer spending . much of consumers ' apparent new-found willingness to spend reflects plans to bring forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the vat rise , experts say . thus , " the economy risks slipping back into its old lethargy at the start of next year , " diw think tank warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth .

the cia is irritated . a fax sent by the egyptian foreign ministry to its embassy in london stated that more than 20 iraqis and afghans had been questioned at a us-run base in romania , a swiss newspaper reported on sunday . sonntagsblick said the swiss secret services obtained a copy of the fax which revealed that the egyptian embassy in london " learned from its own sources that 23 iraqi and afghan citizens had been questioned at the mikhail kogalniceanu base in the town of constanza on the black sea coast . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania was not a transit point for al-qaeda captives , according to romanian officials the newspaper quoted a report written by the swiss fefense ministry which said egypt believed there were " similar centers in ukraine , kosovo , macedonia and bulgaria . " the swiss ministry reacted to the report with a statement saying it would open an investigation into how the information was leaked .
however , because the report is meant to be secret , the ministry refused to comment on its contents . categorical denials a senior officer at the mikhail kogalniceanu base categorically denied the report on sunday . " i have been working at this base since 1995 and i have never been aware of such an operation , " officer dan buciuman said . he added that the base was open to " anyone who wants to carry out an investigation . " amid protests from european governments that their airports are being used by the central intelligence agency to transport suspects , the united states has not denied the existence of alleged prisons in eastern and central europe and elsewhere , but has refuted allegations that it uses torture to obtain information . just in time us television network abc reported in december that the us had held 11 senior members of the al qaeda network in poland but that they were evacuated to north africa shortly before us secretary of state condoleezza rice toured europe that month .

tuition costs 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,430 -rrb- , which students pay with help from their employers , scholarships or out of their own pockets . the university , which also has campuses in munich and near cologne , was first started in 2002 with the backing of some of germany 's top companies , including automaker daimlerchrysler and insurance giant allianz , to improve the standards of germany 's business education and provide german corporations with an increased pool of well-trained labor .
the new berlin branch is accredited by the city-state 's senate . the school is the latest among a handful of private universities to open their doors in germany in the past five years , all of which offer courses in business , among other subjects . billions for research and development the new institution started up as polls continued to show that german universities rank unfavorably against their counterparts abroad .
in a times higher educational supplement survey of the best 200 international universities in 2004 , the highest ranking of a german university was heidelberg at place 47 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even heidelberg university does n't rank high internationally such findings , a brain drain of academics and the poor financial shape of many german universities have been fueling a debate in germany on how to improve education , including creating " elite " universities or charging tuition . last month , the german government decided to spend an additional 6 billion euros in research and development by the end of 2009 .
the plans for the next four years are expected to be finalized by mid-february and focus on life science , health , and nano- and automotive technologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students say no to tuition fees the previous government of social democrats and greens had agreed with germany 's 16 federal states to spend 1.9 billion euros over six years to improve the country 's academic institutions .
the federal government was to contribute 75 percent of the money .
the plan represented a compromise between federal and state governments after the latter had opposed a federal push for 10 elite universities throughout the country . voting with their feet meanwhile , students expressed a variety of academic preferences . when asked what institutions they favored , students said they preferred business education in cologne , münster , düsseldorf and mannheim , according to a recent poll by spiegel online web site .
law students were partial to bochum and hamburg , disdaining berlin 's universities .
would-be doctors chose humboldt university in berlin , cologne , münster , heidelberg and freiburg as their top choices and rejected such universities as those in greifswald , geissen and homburg-saar . the preferred universities were chosen based on academic quality but also on the places students wanted to live .
the poll was carried out in cooperation with the german office that handles students ' requests for transfers to other institutions . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education an export hit in the arab world while germans continue to bemoan their educational system , german higher education is being successfully exported to the arab world .

among other things , ministers will deal with a planned multi-billion investment program . the time has come for germany 's grand coalition to prove that it can really move the country forward .
at the center of the berlin cabinet 's most urgent tasks this year are measures to revive the flagging domestic job market .
unemployment is still only slightly below the five million mark . the difficult task ahead will be to boost consumer spending without losing sight of the larger aim : budget consolidation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is hoping the investment program will help boost construction in their coalition treaty , the christian democratic / christian social union bloc -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and its social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- partner agreed on a special 25 ­ ­ -billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2 billion -rrb- investment program in 2006 to promote employment and growth through more funding for research , improved infrastructure , more support for families and favorable tax treatment for capital investment and home improvement . at their two-day strategy meeting at genshagen castle near berlin , cabinet ministers are hoping to send out a signal of harmony and resolve without sacrificing the profile of the mainstream parties they represent . this in itself seems like squaring the circle .
an added irritation is the fact that some major policy issues have been the subjects of heated debate even within both the spd and the cdu / csu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and angela merkel spd general secretary hubertus heil at the weekend suggested that 25 billion euros for fresh investment would be too little .
but spd labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering hastened to assure the media that the original agreement will remain intact . " i take it that we 'll stick to the 25 billion euros we agreed on in the coalition treaty , " he said .
" we simply have to bear in mind the interests of our finance minister who 's out to consolidate the budget in the medium-term .
the 25 million euros from the state will free more resources in private business .
so , the impact of the investment program will be even bigger . " disagreement over low-wage sector another controversial issue is how to improve conditions for employment in the low-wage sector .
the christian democrats are in favor of granting state subsidies to top up wages and to motivate people to accept relatively low-paid jobs rather than staying at home and living on unemployment benefits . cdu labor affairs spokesman ronald pofalla said he thinks that such a policy makes perfect sense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part-time waiters might benefit from wage subsidies " we believe that the wage subsidies will not turn out to be a major financial burden on state coffers , " he said .
" it 'll be less money than we 'd have to spend otherwise on unemployment benefits . " but social democratic ministers fear that these so-called combined wages could have unforeseeable financial consequences and could lead to a reduction of regular jobs . a nuclear future ? cabinet ministers will also be debating the government 's future energy strategy .
a heated dispute has broken out over whether germany should really phase out nuclear energy completely as decided by the previous government under former chancellor gerhard schröder . the controversy broke out after the recent gas dispute between russia and ukraine fuelled fears about germany 's increased dependence on gas imports from russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in stade in northern germany was the first to be switched off in 2003 conservative economics minister michael glos is among the staunchest supporters of rethinking germany 's nuclear energy policy .
some of his fellow conservatives now even in favor of building new nuclear power plants . these are only some of the issues which are bound to cause some friction at the strategy meeting .
but glos is confident everything can be sorted out in a constructive manner without jeopardizing the governing coalition 's clout . " marriages of convenience often last longer than those based on love , " he said . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?

but spd labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering hastened to assure the media that the original agreement will remain intact . " i take it that we 'll stick to the 25 billion euros we agreed on in the coalition treaty , " he said .
" we simply have to bear in mind the interests of our finance minister who 's out to consolidate the budget in the medium-term .
the 25 million euros from the state will free more resources in private business .
so , the impact of the investment program will be even bigger . " disagreement over low-wage sector another controversial issue is how to improve conditions for employment in the low-wage sector .
the christian democrats are in favor of granting state subsidies to top up wages and to motivate people to accept relatively low-paid jobs rather than staying at home and living on unemployment benefits . cdu labor affairs spokesman ronald pofalla said he thinks that such a policy makes perfect sense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part-time waiters might benefit from wage subsidies " we believe that the wage subsidies will not turn out to be a major financial burden on state coffers , " he said .
" it 'll be less money than we 'd have to spend otherwise on unemployment benefits . " but social democratic ministers fear that these so-called combined wages could have unforeseeable financial consequences and could lead to a reduction of regular jobs . a nuclear future ? cabinet ministers will also be debating the government 's future energy strategy .
a heated dispute has broken out over whether germany should really phase out nuclear energy completely as decided by the previous government under former chancellor gerhard schröder . the controversy broke out after the recent gas dispute between russia and ukraine fuelled fears about germany 's increased dependence on gas imports from russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in stade in northern germany was the first to be switched off in 2003 conservative economics minister michael glos is among the staunchest supporters of rethinking germany 's nuclear energy policy .
some of his fellow conservatives now even in favor of building new nuclear power plants . these are only some of the issues which are bound to cause some friction at the strategy meeting .
but glos is confident everything can be sorted out in a constructive manner without jeopardizing the governing coalition 's clout . " marriages of convenience often last longer than those based on love , " he said . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?

the story of her unprecedented success on the german political scene - part political thriller , part soap opera - should make you think twice before you call somebody a " silly old goose . " while visiting a farm in the german town of lenzen back in 2000 , former chancellor schröder noticed a goose he thought would look pretty nice on his christmas table .
the farm owners were more than happy to accommodate the wishes of their elected leader .
doretta , the goose , received a special ribbon as a mark of distinction among her fellow birds .
she went on cluelessly stuffing herself with whatever food came her way - not knowing , of course , that she was getting her pre-christmas makeover in order to keep the chancellor 's tummy full during the holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta owes her fame to former chancellor schröder and his step daughter klara when schröder , however , went home and told his family about his day , all hell broke loose .
an emergency meeting was convened at the family command room .
due to the sensitivity of the topics discussed , the meeting was closed to the public . but from the information that was leaked to the media , we know that schröder 's stepdaughter klara flatly rejected the chancellor 's report on the goose deal and refused to play any role on the goose slaughtering consortium .
doretta had to be saved . when your stepdad is ruling the country , you do n't take " i ca n't do anything about it " for an answer .
instead , you say " give me a break , daddy .
you 're the chancellor .
just make it happen . " so he did .
doretta , who incidentally turned out to be a gander , but kept proudly using her artistic drag name , was pardoned by the chancellor .
the chancellor 's office sent a yearly appanage for the upkeep of the first first goose in german history .
doretta remained on the farm where she was born , and received just about enough media attention to drive all the other geese mad with jealousy . goosy goosy ga n der , where dost thou wa n der ? life was pretty good for doretta until schröder lost the german elections in sept .
2005 .
after a prolonged and , at times , embarrassing tug-of-war with his conservative rival angela merkel , schröder conceded , and merkel became the first female chancellor in german history .
all of a sudden , doretta was in trouble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former first goose is not a priority on chancellor merkel 's agenda the parliamentary office of the former chancellor stated that the payments for doretta 's upkeep " were limited to -lrb- schröder 's -rrb- chancellorship and would not be continued . " angela merkel 's spokesperson said that doretta was a " topic that frau merkel will not be concerned with . " when asked by tv reporters if she would take over the responsibility of caring for the first goose , angela merkel herself said she believed doretta was " in good hands . " what these statements amount to - once you remove the obfuscating layer of diplomatic lingo - is that everybody was bailing out on poor old doretta . a celebrity for life doretta was , however , meant for more than 15 minutes of fame .
after being described by some analysts as the paris hilton of german geese , doretta is now giving up a life of mindless glamour to get a full-time job with the berlin association " life with animals . "
the organization is a proponent of animal-assisted therapy : it helps people in need improve their physical , social , emotional and cognitive functions by interacting with animals . in other words , no more wild goose chases for this silly old goose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta 's celebrity friends : damon , the dog and fuchs , the cat from the german pet fame academy doretta will go down in history as a controversial , gender-bending first goose , who does n't just live off of its past glory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.01.2006 doretta dethroned : the first goose is loose großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's remained true to herself : doretta , the former first goose her name is doretta .
the story of her unprecedented success on the german political scene - part political thriller , part soap opera - should make you think twice before you call somebody a " silly old goose . " while visiting a farm in the german town of lenzen back in 2000 , former chancellor schröder noticed a goose he thought would look pretty nice on his christmas table .
the farm owners were more than happy to accommodate the wishes of their elected leader .
doretta , the goose , received a special ribbon as a mark of distinction among her fellow birds .
she went on cluelessly stuffing herself with whatever food came her way - not knowing , of course , that she was getting her pre-christmas makeover in order to keep the chancellor 's tummy full during the holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta owes her fame to former chancellor schröder and his step daughter klara when schröder , however , went home and told his family about his day , all hell broke loose .
an emergency meeting was convened at the family command room .
due to the sensitivity of the topics discussed , the meeting was closed to the public . but from the information that was leaked to the media , we know that schröder 's stepdaughter klara flatly rejected the chancellor 's report on the goose deal and refused to play any role on the goose slaughtering consortium .
doretta had to be saved . when your stepdad is ruling the country , you do n't take " i ca n't do anything about it " for an answer .
instead , you say " give me a break , daddy .
you 're the chancellor .
just make it happen . " so he did .
doretta , who incidentally turned out to be a gander , but kept proudly using her artistic drag name , was pardoned by the chancellor .
the chancellor 's office sent a yearly appanage for the upkeep of the first first goose in german history .
doretta remained on the farm where she was born , and received just about enough media attention to drive all the other geese mad with jealousy . goosy goosy ga n der , where dost thou wa n der ? life was pretty good for doretta until schröder lost the german elections in sept .
2005 .
after a prolonged and , at times , embarrassing tug-of-war with his conservative rival angela merkel , schröder conceded , and merkel became the first female chancellor in german history .
all of a sudden , doretta was in trouble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former first goose is not a priority on chancellor merkel 's agenda the parliamentary office of the former chancellor stated that the payments for doretta 's upkeep " were limited to -lrb- schröder 's -rrb- chancellorship and would not be continued . " angela merkel 's spokesperson said that doretta was a " topic that frau merkel will not be concerned with . " when asked by tv reporters if she would take over the responsibility of caring for the first goose , angela merkel herself said she believed doretta was " in good hands . " what these statements amount to - once you remove the obfuscating layer of diplomatic lingo - is that everybody was bailing out on poor old doretta . a celebrity for life doretta was , however , meant for more than 15 minutes of fame .
after being described by some analysts as the paris hilton of german geese , doretta is now giving up a life of mindless glamour to get a full-time job with the berlin association " life with animals . "
the organization is a proponent of animal-assisted therapy : it helps people in need improve their physical , social , emotional and cognitive functions by interacting with animals . in other words , no more wild goose chases for this silly old goose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta 's celebrity friends : damon , the dog and fuchs , the cat from the german pet fame academy doretta will go down in history as a controversial , gender-bending first goose , who does n't just live off of its past glory .
she may not know how to play " twinkle , twinkle , little star " on the xylophone - the way trained chickens do at the fame academy for pets in the german town of wittlich - but she may actually end up making a difference in somebody 's life by remaining true to herself : down-to-earth , awkward and funny . not a small achievement for a goose that at one point almost got eaten into obscurity . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best of from the fringe 2005 click here for a selection of quirkiest stories from dw-world 's series " from the fringe " moshammer 's daisy bids for stardom how many steps does it take to transform a dog from an arm accessory to a television superstar ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.01.2006 when not working is the best option großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more money to take on low-paying work how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?
government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .
economic black holes but the debate wo n't go away .
providing german citizens with some form of basic financial support is the government ’ s constitutional mandate .
at the moment , a modified version is in place nationally .
around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there enough room in the budget to finance low-paying jobs ?
but the current debate is almost as confusing as the byzantine models tested by various german states in the past , say experts , adding that the government - although on the right track - needs to get its facts straight .
" we 've had a few models from which we 've learned , " spermann said .
" but it does n't seem like the politicians are aware of them at the moment .

france joined in the criticism . iran 's decision to resume nuclear research marks a breach of its international commitments and " can not remain without consequence , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on monday . steinmeier said berlin would this week discuss iran 's latest step with france and britain , the other two countries that form the european troika negotiating with tehran on its controversial nuclear program .

" we urge iran to immediately and unconditionally reverse its decision , " douste-blazy told a joint press conference with eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who warned that the situation was " serious .

both the european union and the united states have backed the proposal in principle . but in recent weeks , iranian officials have blown hot and cold about the proposed compromise , first suggesting that they might consider it and then insisting that they would do so only if any deal explicitly recognized its right to carry out enrichment on iranian soil . europe has warned that a resumption of research at facilities in iran , which would end a two-year suspension , would jeopardize future talks on ending the crisis with the west over iran 's nuclear activities .

but observers believe activity is set to pick up sharply this year .
top think-tanks such as ifo in munich and diw in berlin have both recently sharply upgraded their 2006 growth forecasts to 1.7 percent . and the government , which was hitherto expecting a modest 1.2 percent , now believes growth will be in a range of 1.5-1.8 percent , economy minister michael glos indicated last week . berlin is scheduled to publish its latest updated growth forecasts on jan .
25 . " we 're sensing an upturn in the economy , " glos said on the sidelines of a working meeting of his conservative csu party in wildbad kreuth in bavaria . a favorable global economic environment is also expected to have a positive effect on the domestic german economy . in an interview with euro am sonntag newspaper , the head of the economics department of the influential german ifo institute , gebhard flaig , said he was even expecting " growth of 1.5-2.0 percent " this year . germany could see a new economic peak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy could reach new heights in the next two years .
indeed , germany could be on the way to reaching " a new economic peak " in the next two years , if the government pressed ahead with the much-needed structural reforms , flaig said . exports are traditionally the main driver of growth in germany and the bga exporters ' federation said this week that exports were likely to expand by 8 percent this year after increasing by 7 percent in 2005 . but the spark of recovery is also expected to jump over to domestic demand , traditionally the achilles ' heel of german growth , experts believe .
in its regular monthly consumer sentiment survey last month , the market research group gfk found that german households were more willing now than they have been in the past four years to go out and spend money . that will come as good news for the retail sector , where business has declined for the past three years and looks to have stagnated in 2005 . labor market conditions also looking rosier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sweet smell of better employment conditions .
conditions in the labor market also appear to be improving - the jobless rate fell to 11.2 percent in december from 11.4 percent in november in seasonally adjusted terms , data showed last week . and in raw or unadjusted terms , the number of people on unemployment benefits increased by just 75,000 to 4.606 million last month , the slowest level increase since unification . indeed , the federal labor agency believes the jobless total could remain below the politically sensitive level of five million in the winter months . caution urged over one-off economic boosts however , some observers believe the positive economic developments will prove short-lived , since they appear to be driven primarily by one-off factors , such as the upcoming world cup soccer championship and a 25-billion-euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- public investment program by the government . furthermore , the new government under chancellor angela merkel has said it will raise value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19.0 percent at the beginning of 2007 , which could dampen fragile consumer spending . much of consumers ' apparent new-found willingness to spend reflects plans to bring forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the vat rise , experts say . thus , " the economy risks slipping back into its old lethargy at the start of next year , " diw think tank warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth .

but observers believe activity is set to pick up sharply this year .
top think-tanks such as ifo in munich and diw in berlin have both recently sharply upgraded their 2006 growth forecasts to 1.7 percent . and the government , which was hitherto expecting a modest 1.2 percent , now believes growth will be in a range of 1.5-1.8 percent , economy minister michael glos indicated last week . berlin is scheduled to publish its latest updated growth forecasts on jan .
25 . " we 're sensing an upturn in the economy , " glos said on the sidelines of a working meeting of his conservative csu party in wildbad kreuth in bavaria . a favorable global economic environment is also expected to have a positive effect on the domestic german economy . in an interview with euro am sonntag newspaper , the head of the economics department of the influential german ifo institute , gebhard flaig , said he was even expecting " growth of 1.5-2.0 percent " this year . germany could see a new economic peak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy could reach new heights in the next two years .
indeed , germany could be on the way to reaching " a new economic peak " in the next two years , if the government pressed ahead with the much-needed structural reforms , flaig said . exports are traditionally the main driver of growth in germany and the bga exporters ' federation said this week that exports were likely to expand by 8 percent this year after increasing by 7 percent in 2005 . but the spark of recovery is also expected to jump over to domestic demand , traditionally the achilles ' heel of german growth , experts believe .
in its regular monthly consumer sentiment survey last month , the market research group gfk found that german households were more willing now than they have been in the past four years to go out and spend money . that will come as good news for the retail sector , where business has declined for the past three years and looks to have stagnated in 2005 . labor market conditions also looking rosier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sweet smell of better employment conditions .
conditions in the labor market also appear to be improving - the jobless rate fell to 11.2 percent in december from 11.4 percent in november in seasonally adjusted terms , data showed last week . and in raw or unadjusted terms , the number of people on unemployment benefits increased by just 75,000 to 4.606 million last month , the slowest level increase since unification . indeed , the federal labor agency believes the jobless total could remain below the politically sensitive level of five million in the winter months . caution urged over one-off economic boosts however , some observers believe the positive economic developments will prove short-lived , since they appear to be driven primarily by one-off factors , such as the upcoming world cup soccer championship and a 25-billion-euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- public investment program by the government . furthermore , the new government under chancellor angela merkel has said it will raise value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19.0 percent at the beginning of 2007 , which could dampen fragile consumer spending . much of consumers ' apparent new-found willingness to spend reflects plans to bring forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the vat rise , experts say . thus , " the economy risks slipping back into its old lethargy at the start of next year , " diw think tank warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth .

this is a very difficult task , " he said . while washington made it clear last year it supported japan 's bid for permanent council membership , it also adamantly opposed the joint g4 bid . asked why japan was not trying to woo china as well , iida replied : " the us has been forthcoming on un reform and has supported japan 's bid .
this is not the case with china .

" however the g4 is the driving force behind security council reform and we need the g4 countries to cooperate together .

it calls for boosting the council 's membership from the current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats with no veto power - one for each of the g4 members plus two for the african region - and four new non-permanent seats . but the text met stiff opposition from the united states and china , both permanent veto-wielding members of the council along with britain , france and russia . japan to draw up own proposal while advocating unity japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to washington , its main ally , for securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council .

japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.01.2006 government retreats to re-think germany 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " red " and " black " members of government get cozy in genshagen the german government is holding a two-day strategy meeting meant to bring both sides of the " grand coalition " into harmony .
among other things , ministers will deal with a planned multi-billion investment program . the time has come for germany 's grand coalition to prove that it can really move the country forward .
at the center of the berlin cabinet 's most urgent tasks this year are measures to revive the flagging domestic job market .
unemployment is still only slightly below the five million mark . the difficult task ahead will be to boost consumer spending without losing sight of the larger aim : budget consolidation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is hoping the investment program will help boost construction in their coalition treaty , the christian democratic / christian social union bloc -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and its social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- partner agreed on a special 25 ­ ­ -billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2 billion -rrb- investment program in 2006 to promote employment and growth through more funding for research , improved infrastructure , more support for families and favorable tax treatment for capital investment and home improvement . at their two-day strategy meeting at genshagen castle near berlin , cabinet ministers are hoping to send out a signal of harmony and resolve without sacrificing the profile of the mainstream parties they represent . this in itself seems like squaring the circle .
an added irritation is the fact that some major policy issues have been the subjects of heated debate even within both the spd and the cdu / csu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and angela merkel spd general secretary hubertus heil at the weekend suggested that 25 billion euros for fresh investment would be too little .
but spd labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering hastened to assure the media that the original agreement will remain intact . " i take it that we 'll stick to the 25 billion euros we agreed on in the coalition treaty , " he said .
" we simply have to bear in mind the interests of our finance minister who 's out to consolidate the budget in the medium-term .
the 25 million euros from the state will free more resources in private business .
so , the impact of the investment program will be even bigger . " disagreement over low-wage sector another controversial issue is how to improve conditions for employment in the low-wage sector .
the christian democrats are in favor of granting state subsidies to top up wages and to motivate people to accept relatively low-paid jobs rather than staying at home and living on unemployment benefits . cdu labor affairs spokesman ronald pofalla said he thinks that such a policy makes perfect sense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part-time waiters might benefit from wage subsidies " we believe that the wage subsidies will not turn out to be a major financial burden on state coffers , " he said .
" it 'll be less money than we 'd have to spend otherwise on unemployment benefits . " but social democratic ministers fear that these so-called combined wages could have unforeseeable financial consequences and could lead to a reduction of regular jobs . a nuclear future ? cabinet ministers will also be debating the government 's future energy strategy .
a heated dispute has broken out over whether germany should really phase out nuclear energy completely as decided by the previous government under former chancellor gerhard schröder . the controversy broke out after the recent gas dispute between russia and ukraine fuelled fears about germany 's increased dependence on gas imports from russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in stade in northern germany was the first to be switched off in 2003 conservative economics minister michael glos is among the staunchest supporters of rethinking germany 's nuclear energy policy .
some of his fellow conservatives now even in favor of building new nuclear power plants . these are only some of the issues which are bound to cause some friction at the strategy meeting .
but glos is confident everything can be sorted out in a constructive manner without jeopardizing the governing coalition 's clout . " marriages of convenience often last longer than those based on love , " he said . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?

government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .

conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .

government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .

among other things , ministers will deal with a planned multi-billion investment program . the time has come for germany 's grand coalition to prove that it can really move the country forward .
at the center of the berlin cabinet 's most urgent tasks this year are measures to revive the flagging domestic job market .
unemployment is still only slightly below the five million mark . the difficult task ahead will be to boost consumer spending without losing sight of the larger aim : budget consolidation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is hoping the investment program will help boost construction in their coalition treaty , the christian democratic / christian social union bloc -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and its social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- partner agreed on a special 25 ­ ­ -billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2 billion -rrb- investment program in 2006 to promote employment and growth through more funding for research , improved infrastructure , more support for families and favorable tax treatment for capital investment and home improvement . at their two-day strategy meeting at genshagen castle near berlin , cabinet ministers are hoping to send out a signal of harmony and resolve without sacrificing the profile of the mainstream parties they represent . this in itself seems like squaring the circle .
an added irritation is the fact that some major policy issues have been the subjects of heated debate even within both the spd and the cdu / csu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and angela merkel spd general secretary hubertus heil at the weekend suggested that 25 billion euros for fresh investment would be too little .
but spd labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering hastened to assure the media that the original agreement will remain intact . " i take it that we 'll stick to the 25 billion euros we agreed on in the coalition treaty , " he said .
" we simply have to bear in mind the interests of our finance minister who 's out to consolidate the budget in the medium-term .
the 25 million euros from the state will free more resources in private business .
so , the impact of the investment program will be even bigger . " disagreement over low-wage sector another controversial issue is how to improve conditions for employment in the low-wage sector .
the christian democrats are in favor of granting state subsidies to top up wages and to motivate people to accept relatively low-paid jobs rather than staying at home and living on unemployment benefits . cdu labor affairs spokesman ronald pofalla said he thinks that such a policy makes perfect sense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part-time waiters might benefit from wage subsidies " we believe that the wage subsidies will not turn out to be a major financial burden on state coffers , " he said .
" it 'll be less money than we 'd have to spend otherwise on unemployment benefits . " but social democratic ministers fear that these so-called combined wages could have unforeseeable financial consequences and could lead to a reduction of regular jobs . a nuclear future ? cabinet ministers will also be debating the government 's future energy strategy .
a heated dispute has broken out over whether germany should really phase out nuclear energy completely as decided by the previous government under former chancellor gerhard schröder . the controversy broke out after the recent gas dispute between russia and ukraine fuelled fears about germany 's increased dependence on gas imports from russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in stade in northern germany was the first to be switched off in 2003 conservative economics minister michael glos is among the staunchest supporters of rethinking germany 's nuclear energy policy .
some of his fellow conservatives now even in favor of building new nuclear power plants . these are only some of the issues which are bound to cause some friction at the strategy meeting .
but glos is confident everything can be sorted out in a constructive manner without jeopardizing the governing coalition 's clout .

they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .
economic black holes but the debate wo n't go away .
providing german citizens with some form of basic financial support is the government ’ s constitutional mandate .
at the moment , a modified version is in place nationally .
around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there enough room in the budget to finance low-paying jobs ?
but the current debate is almost as confusing as the byzantine models tested by various german states in the past , say experts , adding that the government - although on the right track - needs to get its facts straight .

among other things , ministers will deal with a planned multi-billion investment program . the time has come for germany 's grand coalition to prove that it can really move the country forward .
at the center of the berlin cabinet 's most urgent tasks this year are measures to revive the flagging domestic job market .
unemployment is still only slightly below the five million mark . the difficult task ahead will be to boost consumer spending without losing sight of the larger aim : budget consolidation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is hoping the investment program will help boost construction in their coalition treaty , the christian democratic / christian social union bloc -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and its social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- partner agreed on a special 25 ­ ­ -billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2 billion -rrb- investment program in 2006 to promote employment and growth through more funding for research , improved infrastructure , more support for families and favorable tax treatment for capital investment and home improvement . at their two-day strategy meeting at genshagen castle near berlin , cabinet ministers are hoping to send out a signal of harmony and resolve without sacrificing the profile of the mainstream parties they represent . this in itself seems like squaring the circle .
an added irritation is the fact that some major policy issues have been the subjects of heated debate even within both the spd and the cdu / csu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and angela merkel spd general secretary hubertus heil at the weekend suggested that 25 billion euros for fresh investment would be too little .
but spd labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering hastened to assure the media that the original agreement will remain intact . " i take it that we 'll stick to the 25 billion euros we agreed on in the coalition treaty , " he said .
" we simply have to bear in mind the interests of our finance minister who 's out to consolidate the budget in the medium-term .
the 25 million euros from the state will free more resources in private business .
so , the impact of the investment program will be even bigger . " disagreement over low-wage sector another controversial issue is how to improve conditions for employment in the low-wage sector .
the christian democrats are in favor of granting state subsidies to top up wages and to motivate people to accept relatively low-paid jobs rather than staying at home and living on unemployment benefits . cdu labor affairs spokesman ronald pofalla said he thinks that such a policy makes perfect sense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part-time waiters might benefit from wage subsidies " we believe that the wage subsidies will not turn out to be a major financial burden on state coffers , " he said .
" it 'll be less money than we 'd have to spend otherwise on unemployment benefits . " but social democratic ministers fear that these so-called combined wages could have unforeseeable financial consequences and could lead to a reduction of regular jobs . a nuclear future ? cabinet ministers will also be debating the government 's future energy strategy .
a heated dispute has broken out over whether germany should really phase out nuclear energy completely as decided by the previous government under former chancellor gerhard schröder . the controversy broke out after the recent gas dispute between russia and ukraine fuelled fears about germany 's increased dependence on gas imports from russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in stade in northern germany was the first to be switched off in 2003 conservative economics minister michael glos is among the staunchest supporters of rethinking germany 's nuclear energy policy .
some of his fellow conservatives now even in favor of building new nuclear power plants . these are only some of the issues which are bound to cause some friction at the strategy meeting .
but glos is confident everything can be sorted out in a constructive manner without jeopardizing the governing coalition 's clout . " marriages of convenience often last longer than those based on love , " he said . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?

the story of her unprecedented success on the german political scene - part political thriller , part soap opera - should make you think twice before you call somebody a " silly old goose . " while visiting a farm in the german town of lenzen back in 2000 , former chancellor schröder noticed a goose he thought would look pretty nice on his christmas table .
the farm owners were more than happy to accommodate the wishes of their elected leader .
doretta , the goose , received a special ribbon as a mark of distinction among her fellow birds .
she went on cluelessly stuffing herself with whatever food came her way - not knowing , of course , that she was getting her pre-christmas makeover in order to keep the chancellor 's tummy full during the holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta owes her fame to former chancellor schröder and his step daughter klara when schröder , however , went home and told his family about his day , all hell broke loose .
an emergency meeting was convened at the family command room .
due to the sensitivity of the topics discussed , the meeting was closed to the public . but from the information that was leaked to the media , we know that schröder 's stepdaughter klara flatly rejected the chancellor 's report on the goose deal and refused to play any role on the goose slaughtering consortium .
doretta had to be saved . when your stepdad is ruling the country , you do n't take " i ca n't do anything about it " for an answer .
instead , you say " give me a break , daddy .
you 're the chancellor .

doretta , who incidentally turned out to be a gander , but kept proudly using her artistic drag name , was pardoned by the chancellor .
the chancellor 's office sent a yearly appanage for the upkeep of the first first goose in german history .

" when asked by tv reporters if she would take over the responsibility of caring for the first goose , angela merkel herself said she believed doretta was " in good hands . " what these statements amount to - once you remove the obfuscating layer of diplomatic lingo - is that everybody was bailing out on poor old doretta . a celebrity for life doretta was , however , meant for more than 15 minutes of fame .
after being described by some analysts as the paris hilton of german geese , doretta is now giving up a life of mindless glamour to get a full-time job with the berlin association " life with animals . "

the story of her unprecedented success on the german political scene - part political thriller , part soap opera - should make you think twice before you call somebody a " silly old goose . " while visiting a farm in the german town of lenzen back in 2000 , former chancellor schröder noticed a goose he thought would look pretty nice on his christmas table .
the farm owners were more than happy to accommodate the wishes of their elected leader .
doretta , the goose , received a special ribbon as a mark of distinction among her fellow birds .
she went on cluelessly stuffing herself with whatever food came her way - not knowing , of course , that she was getting her pre-christmas makeover in order to keep the chancellor 's tummy full during the holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta owes her fame to former chancellor schröder and his step daughter klara when schröder , however , went home and told his family about his day , all hell broke loose .
an emergency meeting was convened at the family command room .
due to the sensitivity of the topics discussed , the meeting was closed to the public . but from the information that was leaked to the media , we know that schröder 's stepdaughter klara flatly rejected the chancellor 's report on the goose deal and refused to play any role on the goose slaughtering consortium .
doretta had to be saved . when your stepdad is ruling the country , you do n't take " i ca n't do anything about it " for an answer .
instead , you say " give me a break , daddy .
you 're the chancellor .
just make it happen . " so he did .
doretta , who incidentally turned out to be a gander , but kept proudly using her artistic drag name , was pardoned by the chancellor .
the chancellor 's office sent a yearly appanage for the upkeep of the first first goose in german history .
doretta remained on the farm where she was born , and received just about enough media attention to drive all the other geese mad with jealousy . goosy goosy ga n der , where dost thou wa n der ? life was pretty good for doretta until schröder lost the german elections in sept .
2005 .
after a prolonged and , at times , embarrassing tug-of-war with his conservative rival angela merkel , schröder conceded , and merkel became the first female chancellor in german history .
all of a sudden , doretta was in trouble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former first goose is not a priority on chancellor merkel 's agenda the parliamentary office of the former chancellor stated that the payments for doretta 's upkeep " were limited to -lrb- schröder 's -rrb- chancellorship and would not be continued . " angela merkel 's spokesperson said that doretta was a " topic that frau merkel will not be concerned with . " when asked by tv reporters if she would take over the responsibility of caring for the first goose , angela merkel herself said she believed doretta was " in good hands . " what these statements amount to - once you remove the obfuscating layer of diplomatic lingo - is that everybody was bailing out on poor old doretta . a celebrity for life doretta was , however , meant for more than 15 minutes of fame .
after being described by some analysts as the paris hilton of german geese , doretta is now giving up a life of mindless glamour to get a full-time job with the berlin association " life with animals . "

the story of her unprecedented success on the german political scene - part political thriller , part soap opera - should make you think twice before you call somebody a " silly old goose . " while visiting a farm in the german town of lenzen back in 2000 , former chancellor schröder noticed a goose he thought would look pretty nice on his christmas table .
the farm owners were more than happy to accommodate the wishes of their elected leader .
doretta , the goose , received a special ribbon as a mark of distinction among her fellow birds .
she went on cluelessly stuffing herself with whatever food came her way - not knowing , of course , that she was getting her pre-christmas makeover in order to keep the chancellor 's tummy full during the holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta owes her fame to former chancellor schröder and his step daughter klara when schröder , however , went home and told his family about his day , all hell broke loose .
an emergency meeting was convened at the family command room .
due to the sensitivity of the topics discussed , the meeting was closed to the public . but from the information that was leaked to the media , we know that schröder 's stepdaughter klara flatly rejected the chancellor 's report on the goose deal and refused to play any role on the goose slaughtering consortium .
doretta had to be saved . when your stepdad is ruling the country , you do n't take " i ca n't do anything about it " for an answer .
instead , you say " give me a break , daddy .
you 're the chancellor .
just make it happen . " so he did .
doretta , who incidentally turned out to be a gander , but kept proudly using her artistic drag name , was pardoned by the chancellor .
the chancellor 's office sent a yearly appanage for the upkeep of the first first goose in german history .
doretta remained on the farm where she was born , and received just about enough media attention to drive all the other geese mad with jealousy . goosy goosy ga n der , where dost thou wa n der ? life was pretty good for doretta until schröder lost the german elections in sept .

the story of her unprecedented success on the german political scene - part political thriller , part soap opera - should make you think twice before you call somebody a " silly old goose . " while visiting a farm in the german town of lenzen back in 2000 , former chancellor schröder noticed a goose he thought would look pretty nice on his christmas table .
the farm owners were more than happy to accommodate the wishes of their elected leader .
doretta , the goose , received a special ribbon as a mark of distinction among her fellow birds .
she went on cluelessly stuffing herself with whatever food came her way - not knowing , of course , that she was getting her pre-christmas makeover in order to keep the chancellor 's tummy full during the holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta owes her fame to former chancellor schröder and his step daughter klara when schröder , however , went home and told his family about his day , all hell broke loose .
an emergency meeting was convened at the family command room .
due to the sensitivity of the topics discussed , the meeting was closed to the public . but from the information that was leaked to the media , we know that schröder 's stepdaughter klara flatly rejected the chancellor 's report on the goose deal and refused to play any role on the goose slaughtering consortium .
doretta had to be saved . when your stepdad is ruling the country , you do n't take " i ca n't do anything about it " for an answer .
instead , you say " give me a break , daddy .
you 're the chancellor .
just make it happen . " so he did .
doretta , who incidentally turned out to be a gander , but kept proudly using her artistic drag name , was pardoned by the chancellor .
the chancellor 's office sent a yearly appanage for the upkeep of the first first goose in german history .
doretta remained on the farm where she was born , and received just about enough media attention to drive all the other geese mad with jealousy . goosy goosy ga n der , where dost thou wa n der ? life was pretty good for doretta until schröder lost the german elections in sept .
2005 .
after a prolonged and , at times , embarrassing tug-of-war with his conservative rival angela merkel , schröder conceded , and merkel became the first female chancellor in german history .
all of a sudden , doretta was in trouble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former first goose is not a priority on chancellor merkel 's agenda the parliamentary office of the former chancellor stated that the payments for doretta 's upkeep " were limited to -lrb- schröder 's -rrb- chancellorship and would not be continued . " angela merkel 's spokesperson said that doretta was a " topic that frau merkel will not be concerned with . " when asked by tv reporters if she would take over the responsibility of caring for the first goose , angela merkel herself said she believed doretta was " in good hands . " what these statements amount to - once you remove the obfuscating layer of diplomatic lingo - is that everybody was bailing out on poor old doretta . a celebrity for life doretta was , however , meant for more than 15 minutes of fame .
after being described by some analysts as the paris hilton of german geese , doretta is now giving up a life of mindless glamour to get a full-time job with the berlin association " life with animals . "
the organization is a proponent of animal-assisted therapy : it helps people in need improve their physical , social , emotional and cognitive functions by interacting with animals . in other words , no more wild goose chases for this silly old goose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta 's celebrity friends : damon , the dog and fuchs , the cat from the german pet fame academy doretta will go down in history as a controversial , gender-bending first goose , who does n't just live off of its past glory .
she may not know how to play " twinkle , twinkle , little star " on the xylophone - the way trained chickens do at the fame academy for pets in the german town of wittlich - but she may actually end up making a difference in somebody 's life by remaining true to herself : down-to-earth , awkward and funny . not a small achievement for a goose that at one point almost got eaten into obscurity . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best of from the fringe 2005 click here for a selection of quirkiest stories from dw-world 's series " from the fringe " moshammer 's daisy bids for stardom how many steps does it take to transform a dog from an arm accessory to a television superstar ?

" there is a clear distinction between the g4 draft resolution and the g4 cooperative framework , " shinichi iida , first secretary at japan 's un mission , told afp .
" we do not believe the g4 draft in its current form can garner the necessary support , " he added .
" however the g4 is the driving force behind security council reform and we need the g4 countries to cooperate together . " the latest draft submitted to the un secretariat is similar to one already presented last year by brazil , germany , india and japan which failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the un general assembly .
it calls for boosting the council 's membership from the current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats with no veto power - one for each of the g4 members plus two for the african region - and four new non-permanent seats . but the text met stiff opposition from the united states and china , both permanent veto-wielding members of the council along with britain , france and russia . japan to draw up own proposal while advocating unity japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to washington , its main ally , for securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council .

japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . " we are in serious dialogue with the united states and we are hoping we will be able to come up with a new plan that they can support , " iida said .
" we need us support on a specific plan .
then we will go to the other g4 members and negotiate with them . " " we need both the us and the g4 on board to make council reform happen .
this is a very difficult task , " he said . while washington made it clear last year it supported japan 's bid for permanent council membership , it also adamantly opposed the joint g4 bid . asked why japan was not trying to woo china as well , iida replied : " the us has been forthcoming on un reform and has supported japan 's bid .
this is not the case with china . " " we have started a dialogue with the chinese as well but the discussions with the chinese are fundamentally and substantively different from what we are doing with the americans , " he said . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to join this time , the other three g4 members would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . germany sees japan as " straying from the group " and a german diplomat said tokyo 's g4 partners did not consider that " japan has strayed from the group .

we see it as a way of burden-sharing .
if japan thinks they can get the us on board , that 's great and we would welcome it and we also said we 're open to amendments .
we are not aiming for a vote in the immediate future .
so if these talks generate some positive results , then we might amend the text and broaden the support , " she added . iida said his government also felt that it would have been better for the g4 to wait for the 53-member african union -lrb- au -rrb- to clarify its own stand on security council reform at a planned summit later this month . last october , the au , whose support for the g4 proposal is seen as crucial , renewed its demand for a 26-seat security council .

" however the g4 is the driving force behind security council reform and we need the g4 countries to cooperate together .

it calls for boosting the council 's membership from the current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats with no veto power - one for each of the g4 members plus two for the african region - and four new non-permanent seats . but the text met stiff opposition from the united states and china , both permanent veto-wielding members of the council along with britain , france and russia . japan to draw up own proposal while advocating unity japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to washington , its main ally , for securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan is cosying up to the united states - a move that has unsettled its g4 partners .
japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . " we are in serious dialogue with the united states and we are hoping we will be able to come up with a new plan that they can support , " iida said .
" we need us support on a specific plan .
then we will go to the other g4 members and negotiate with them . " " we need both the us and the g4 on board to make council reform happen .
this is a very difficult task , " he said . while washington made it clear last year it supported japan 's bid for permanent council membership , it also adamantly opposed the joint g4 bid . asked why japan was not trying to woo china as well , iida replied : " the us has been forthcoming on un reform and has supported japan 's bid .
this is not the case with china . " " we have started a dialogue with the chinese as well but the discussions with the chinese are fundamentally and substantively different from what we are doing with the americans , " he said . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to join this time , the other three g4 members would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . germany sees japan as " straying from the group " and a german diplomat said tokyo 's g4 partners did not consider that " japan has strayed from the group .
we believe that so far the g4 draft is the best proposal in the sense that it generates the broadest support , " she noted .

asked why the g4 as a group was not trying to enlist us support , the german diplomat replied : " we have also addressed the us but so far they chose to speak to the japanese and that 's fine .
we see it as a way of burden-sharing .
if japan thinks they can get the us on board , that 's great and we would welcome it and we also said we 're open to amendments .
we are not aiming for a vote in the immediate future .
so if these talks generate some positive results , then we might amend the text and broaden the support , " she added . iida said his government also felt that it would have been better for the g4 to wait for the 53-member african union -lrb- au -rrb- to clarify its own stand on security council reform at a planned summit later this month . last october , the au , whose support for the g4 proposal is seen as crucial , renewed its demand for a 26-seat security council .

" there is a clear distinction between the g4 draft resolution and the g4 cooperative framework , " shinichi iida , first secretary at japan 's un mission , told afp .
" we do not believe the g4 draft in its current form can garner the necessary support , " he added .
" however the g4 is the driving force behind security council reform and we need the g4 countries to cooperate together . " the latest draft submitted to the un secretariat is similar to one already presented last year by brazil , germany , india and japan which failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the un general assembly .
it calls for boosting the council 's membership from the current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats with no veto power - one for each of the g4 members plus two for the african region - and four new non-permanent seats . but the text met stiff opposition from the united states and china , both permanent veto-wielding members of the council along with britain , france and russia . japan to draw up own proposal while advocating unity japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to washington , its main ally , for securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan is cosying up to the united states - a move that has unsettled its g4 partners .
japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . " we are in serious dialogue with the united states and we are hoping we will be able to come up with a new plan that they can support , " iida said .
" we need us support on a specific plan .
then we will go to the other g4 members and negotiate with them . " " we need both the us and the g4 on board to make council reform happen .
this is a very difficult task , " he said . while washington made it clear last year it supported japan 's bid for permanent council membership , it also adamantly opposed the joint g4 bid . asked why japan was not trying to woo china as well , iida replied : " the us has been forthcoming on un reform and has supported japan 's bid .
this is not the case with china . " " we have started a dialogue with the chinese as well but the discussions with the chinese are fundamentally and substantively different from what we are doing with the americans , " he said . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to join this time , the other three g4 members would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . germany sees japan as " straying from the group " and a german diplomat said tokyo 's g4 partners did not consider that " japan has strayed from the group .
we believe that so far the g4 draft is the best proposal in the sense that it generates the broadest support , " she noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will enter the un debate started by his predecessor .
asked why the g4 as a group was not trying to enlist us support , the german diplomat replied : " we have also addressed the us but so far they chose to speak to the japanese and that 's fine .
we see it as a way of burden-sharing .
if japan thinks they can get the us on board , that 's great and we would welcome it and we also said we 're open to amendments .
we are not aiming for a vote in the immediate future .
so if these talks generate some positive results , then we might amend the text and broaden the support , " she added . iida said his government also felt that it would have been better for the g4 to wait for the 53-member african union -lrb- au -rrb- to clarify its own stand on security council reform at a planned summit later this month . last october , the au , whose support for the g4 proposal is seen as crucial , renewed its demand for a 26-seat security council .
under this scenario , africa would get two of six new permanent seats with veto power as well as two of five new non-permanent seats . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de japan gives up joint g4 bid to reform un security council with japan 's decision to pursue permanent membership on the un security council without its g4 allies , the prospects of germany joining the big guys in the top un body are looking less rosy than ever .

among other things , ministers will deal with a planned multi-billion investment program . the time has come for germany 's grand coalition to prove that it can really move the country forward .
at the center of the berlin cabinet 's most urgent tasks this year are measures to revive the flagging domestic job market .
unemployment is still only slightly below the five million mark . the difficult task ahead will be to boost consumer spending without losing sight of the larger aim : budget consolidation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is hoping the investment program will help boost construction in their coalition treaty , the christian democratic / christian social union bloc -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and its social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- partner agreed on a special 25 ­ ­ -billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2 billion -rrb- investment program in 2006 to promote employment and growth through more funding for research , improved infrastructure , more support for families and favorable tax treatment for capital investment and home improvement . at their two-day strategy meeting at genshagen castle near berlin , cabinet ministers are hoping to send out a signal of harmony and resolve without sacrificing the profile of the mainstream parties they represent . this in itself seems like squaring the circle .
an added irritation is the fact that some major policy issues have been the subjects of heated debate even within both the spd and the cdu / csu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and angela merkel spd general secretary hubertus heil at the weekend suggested that 25 billion euros for fresh investment would be too little .
but spd labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering hastened to assure the media that the original agreement will remain intact . " i take it that we 'll stick to the 25 billion euros we agreed on in the coalition treaty , " he said .
" we simply have to bear in mind the interests of our finance minister who 's out to consolidate the budget in the medium-term .
the 25 million euros from the state will free more resources in private business .
so , the impact of the investment program will be even bigger . " disagreement over low-wage sector another controversial issue is how to improve conditions for employment in the low-wage sector .
the christian democrats are in favor of granting state subsidies to top up wages and to motivate people to accept relatively low-paid jobs rather than staying at home and living on unemployment benefits . cdu labor affairs spokesman ronald pofalla said he thinks that such a policy makes perfect sense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part-time waiters might benefit from wage subsidies " we believe that the wage subsidies will not turn out to be a major financial burden on state coffers , " he said .
" it 'll be less money than we 'd have to spend otherwise on unemployment benefits . " but social democratic ministers fear that these so-called combined wages could have unforeseeable financial consequences and could lead to a reduction of regular jobs . a nuclear future ? cabinet ministers will also be debating the government 's future energy strategy .
a heated dispute has broken out over whether germany should really phase out nuclear energy completely as decided by the previous government under former chancellor gerhard schröder . the controversy broke out after the recent gas dispute between russia and ukraine fuelled fears about germany 's increased dependence on gas imports from russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in stade in northern germany was the first to be switched off in 2003 conservative economics minister michael glos is among the staunchest supporters of rethinking germany 's nuclear energy policy .
some of his fellow conservatives now even in favor of building new nuclear power plants . these are only some of the issues which are bound to cause some friction at the strategy meeting .
but glos is confident everything can be sorted out in a constructive manner without jeopardizing the governing coalition 's clout . " marriages of convenience often last longer than those based on love , " he said . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?

the cia is irritated . a fax sent by the egyptian foreign ministry to its embassy in london stated that more than 20 iraqis and afghans had been questioned at a us-run base in romania , a swiss newspaper reported on sunday . sonntagsblick said the swiss secret services obtained a copy of the fax which revealed that the egyptian embassy in london " learned from its own sources that 23 iraqi and afghan citizens had been questioned at the mikhail kogalniceanu base in the town of constanza on the black sea coast .

however , because the report is meant to be secret , the ministry refused to comment on its contents . categorical denials a senior officer at the mikhail kogalniceanu base categorically denied the report on sunday . " i have been working at this base since 1995 and i have never been aware of such an operation , " officer dan buciuman said . he added that the base was open to " anyone who wants to carry out an investigation .

the cia is irritated . a fax sent by the egyptian foreign ministry to its embassy in london stated that more than 20 iraqis and afghans had been questioned at a us-run base in romania , a swiss newspaper reported on sunday . sonntagsblick said the swiss secret services obtained a copy of the fax which revealed that the egyptian embassy in london " learned from its own sources that 23 iraqi and afghan citizens had been questioned at the mikhail kogalniceanu base in the town of constanza on the black sea coast . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania was not a transit point for al-qaeda captives , according to romanian officials the newspaper quoted a report written by the swiss fefense ministry which said egypt believed there were " similar centers in ukraine , kosovo , macedonia and bulgaria . " the swiss ministry reacted to the report with a statement saying it would open an investigation into how the information was leaked .
however , because the report is meant to be secret , the ministry refused to comment on its contents . categorical denials a senior officer at the mikhail kogalniceanu base categorically denied the report on sunday . " i have been working at this base since 1995 and i have never been aware of such an operation , " officer dan buciuman said . he added that the base was open to " anyone who wants to carry out an investigation . " amid protests from european governments that their airports are being used by the central intelligence agency to transport suspects , the united states has not denied the existence of alleged prisons in eastern and central europe and elsewhere , but has refuted allegations that it uses torture to obtain information . just in time us television network abc reported in december that the us had held 11 senior members of the al qaeda network in poland but that they were evacuated to north africa shortly before us secretary of state condoleezza rice toured europe that month .

but observers believe activity is set to pick up sharply this year .
top think-tanks such as ifo in munich and diw in berlin have both recently sharply upgraded their 2006 growth forecasts to 1.7 percent . and the government , which was hitherto expecting a modest 1.2 percent , now believes growth will be in a range of 1.5-1.8 percent , economy minister michael glos indicated last week . berlin is scheduled to publish its latest updated growth forecasts on jan .
25 . " we 're sensing an upturn in the economy , " glos said on the sidelines of a working meeting of his conservative csu party in wildbad kreuth in bavaria . a favorable global economic environment is also expected to have a positive effect on the domestic german economy . in an interview with euro am sonntag newspaper , the head of the economics department of the influential german ifo institute , gebhard flaig , said he was even expecting " growth of 1.5-2.0 percent " this year . germany could see a new economic peak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy could reach new heights in the next two years .
indeed , germany could be on the way to reaching " a new economic peak " in the next two years , if the government pressed ahead with the much-needed structural reforms , flaig said . exports are traditionally the main driver of growth in germany and the bga exporters ' federation said this week that exports were likely to expand by 8 percent this year after increasing by 7 percent in 2005 . but the spark of recovery is also expected to jump over to domestic demand , traditionally the achilles ' heel of german growth , experts believe .
in its regular monthly consumer sentiment survey last month , the market research group gfk found that german households were more willing now than they have been in the past four years to go out and spend money . that will come as good news for the retail sector , where business has declined for the past three years and looks to have stagnated in 2005 . labor market conditions also looking rosier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sweet smell of better employment conditions .
conditions in the labor market also appear to be improving - the jobless rate fell to 11.2 percent in december from 11.4 percent in november in seasonally adjusted terms , data showed last week . and in raw or unadjusted terms , the number of people on unemployment benefits increased by just 75,000 to 4.606 million last month , the slowest level increase since unification . indeed , the federal labor agency believes the jobless total could remain below the politically sensitive level of five million in the winter months . caution urged over one-off economic boosts however , some observers believe the positive economic developments will prove short-lived , since they appear to be driven primarily by one-off factors , such as the upcoming world cup soccer championship and a 25-billion-euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- public investment program by the government . furthermore , the new government under chancellor angela merkel has said it will raise value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19.0 percent at the beginning of 2007 , which could dampen fragile consumer spending . much of consumers ' apparent new-found willingness to spend reflects plans to bring forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the vat rise , experts say . thus , " the economy risks slipping back into its old lethargy at the start of next year , " diw think tank warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth .

but observers believe activity is set to pick up sharply this year .
top think-tanks such as ifo in munich and diw in berlin have both recently sharply upgraded their 2006 growth forecasts to 1.7 percent . and the government , which was hitherto expecting a modest 1.2 percent , now believes growth will be in a range of 1.5-1.8 percent , economy minister michael glos indicated last week . berlin is scheduled to publish its latest updated growth forecasts on jan .
25 . " we 're sensing an upturn in the economy , " glos said on the sidelines of a working meeting of his conservative csu party in wildbad kreuth in bavaria . a favorable global economic environment is also expected to have a positive effect on the domestic german economy . in an interview with euro am sonntag newspaper , the head of the economics department of the influential german ifo institute , gebhard flaig , said he was even expecting " growth of 1.5-2.0 percent " this year . germany could see a new economic peak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy could reach new heights in the next two years .
indeed , germany could be on the way to reaching " a new economic peak " in the next two years , if the government pressed ahead with the much-needed structural reforms , flaig said . exports are traditionally the main driver of growth in germany and the bga exporters ' federation said this week that exports were likely to expand by 8 percent this year after increasing by 7 percent in 2005 . but the spark of recovery is also expected to jump over to domestic demand , traditionally the achilles ' heel of german growth , experts believe .
in its regular monthly consumer sentiment survey last month , the market research group gfk found that german households were more willing now than they have been in the past four years to go out and spend money . that will come as good news for the retail sector , where business has declined for the past three years and looks to have stagnated in 2005 . labor market conditions also looking rosier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sweet smell of better employment conditions .
conditions in the labor market also appear to be improving - the jobless rate fell to 11.2 percent in december from 11.4 percent in november in seasonally adjusted terms , data showed last week . and in raw or unadjusted terms , the number of people on unemployment benefits increased by just 75,000 to 4.606 million last month , the slowest level increase since unification . indeed , the federal labor agency believes the jobless total could remain below the politically sensitive level of five million in the winter months . caution urged over one-off economic boosts however , some observers believe the positive economic developments will prove short-lived , since they appear to be driven primarily by one-off factors , such as the upcoming world cup soccer championship and a 25-billion-euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- public investment program by the government . furthermore , the new government under chancellor angela merkel has said it will raise value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19.0 percent at the beginning of 2007 , which could dampen fragile consumer spending . much of consumers ' apparent new-found willingness to spend reflects plans to bring forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the vat rise , experts say . thus , " the economy risks slipping back into its old lethargy at the start of next year , " diw think tank warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth .

the cia is irritated . a fax sent by the egyptian foreign ministry to its embassy in london stated that more than 20 iraqis and afghans had been questioned at a us-run base in romania , a swiss newspaper reported on sunday . sonntagsblick said the swiss secret services obtained a copy of the fax which revealed that the egyptian embassy in london " learned from its own sources that 23 iraqi and afghan citizens had been questioned at the mikhail kogalniceanu base in the town of constanza on the black sea coast . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania was not a transit point for al-qaeda captives , according to romanian officials the newspaper quoted a report written by the swiss fefense ministry which said egypt believed there were " similar centers in ukraine , kosovo , macedonia and bulgaria . " the swiss ministry reacted to the report with a statement saying it would open an investigation into how the information was leaked .
however , because the report is meant to be secret , the ministry refused to comment on its contents . categorical denials a senior officer at the mikhail kogalniceanu base categorically denied the report on sunday . " i have been working at this base since 1995 and i have never been aware of such an operation , " officer dan buciuman said . he added that the base was open to " anyone who wants to carry out an investigation . " amid protests from european governments that their airports are being used by the central intelligence agency to transport suspects , the united states has not denied the existence of alleged prisons in eastern and central europe and elsewhere , but has refuted allegations that it uses torture to obtain information . just in time us television network abc reported in december that the us had held 11 senior members of the al qaeda network in poland but that they were evacuated to north africa shortly before us secretary of state condoleezza rice toured europe that month .

but observers believe activity is set to pick up sharply this year .
top think-tanks such as ifo in munich and diw in berlin have both recently sharply upgraded their 2006 growth forecasts to 1.7 percent . and the government , which was hitherto expecting a modest 1.2 percent , now believes growth will be in a range of 1.5-1.8 percent , economy minister michael glos indicated last week . berlin is scheduled to publish its latest updated growth forecasts on jan .

indeed , germany could be on the way to reaching " a new economic peak " in the next two years , if the government pressed ahead with the much-needed structural reforms , flaig said . exports are traditionally the main driver of growth in germany and the bga exporters ' federation said this week that exports were likely to expand by 8 percent this year after increasing by 7 percent in 2005 . but the spark of recovery is also expected to jump over to domestic demand , traditionally the achilles ' heel of german growth , experts believe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.01.2006 when not working is the best option großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little more money to take on low-paying work how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?
government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .
economic black holes but the debate wo n't go away .
providing german citizens with some form of basic financial support is the government ’ s constitutional mandate .
at the moment , a modified version is in place nationally .
around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there enough room in the budget to finance low-paying jobs ?
but the current debate is almost as confusing as the byzantine models tested by various german states in the past , say experts , adding that the government - although on the right track - needs to get its facts straight .
" we 've had a few models from which we 've learned , " spermann said .
" but it does n't seem like the politicians are aware of them at the moment .

government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .
economic black holes but the debate wo n't go away .
providing german citizens with some form of basic financial support is the government ’ s constitutional mandate .
at the moment , a modified version is in place nationally .
around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .

government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .
economic black holes but the debate wo n't go away .
providing german citizens with some form of basic financial support is the government ’ s constitutional mandate .
at the moment , a modified version is in place nationally .
around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there enough room in the budget to finance low-paying jobs ?
but the current debate is almost as confusing as the byzantine models tested by various german states in the past , say experts , adding that the government - although on the right track - needs to get its facts straight .

the cia is irritated . a fax sent by the egyptian foreign ministry to its embassy in london stated that more than 20 iraqis and afghans had been questioned at a us-run base in romania , a swiss newspaper reported on sunday . sonntagsblick said the swiss secret services obtained a copy of the fax which revealed that the egyptian embassy in london " learned from its own sources that 23 iraqi and afghan citizens had been questioned at the mikhail kogalniceanu base in the town of constanza on the black sea coast .

but observers believe activity is set to pick up sharply this year .
top think-tanks such as ifo in munich and diw in berlin have both recently sharply upgraded their 2006 growth forecasts to 1.7 percent . and the government , which was hitherto expecting a modest 1.2 percent , now believes growth will be in a range of 1.5-1.8 percent , economy minister michael glos indicated last week . berlin is scheduled to publish its latest updated growth forecasts on jan .
25 . " we 're sensing an upturn in the economy , " glos said on the sidelines of a working meeting of his conservative csu party in wildbad kreuth in bavaria . a favorable global economic environment is also expected to have a positive effect on the domestic german economy . in an interview with euro am sonntag newspaper , the head of the economics department of the influential german ifo institute , gebhard flaig , said he was even expecting " growth of 1.5-2.0 percent " this year . germany could see a new economic peak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy could reach new heights in the next two years .
indeed , germany could be on the way to reaching " a new economic peak " in the next two years , if the government pressed ahead with the much-needed structural reforms , flaig said . exports are traditionally the main driver of growth in germany and the bga exporters ' federation said this week that exports were likely to expand by 8 percent this year after increasing by 7 percent in 2005 . but the spark of recovery is also expected to jump over to domestic demand , traditionally the achilles ' heel of german growth , experts believe .
in its regular monthly consumer sentiment survey last month , the market research group gfk found that german households were more willing now than they have been in the past four years to go out and spend money . that will come as good news for the retail sector , where business has declined for the past three years and looks to have stagnated in 2005 . labor market conditions also looking rosier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sweet smell of better employment conditions .
conditions in the labor market also appear to be improving - the jobless rate fell to 11.2 percent in december from 11.4 percent in november in seasonally adjusted terms , data showed last week . and in raw or unadjusted terms , the number of people on unemployment benefits increased by just 75,000 to 4.606 million last month , the slowest level increase since unification . indeed , the federal labor agency believes the jobless total could remain below the politically sensitive level of five million in the winter months . caution urged over one-off economic boosts however , some observers believe the positive economic developments will prove short-lived , since they appear to be driven primarily by one-off factors , such as the upcoming world cup soccer championship and a 25-billion-euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- public investment program by the government . furthermore , the new government under chancellor angela merkel has said it will raise value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19.0 percent at the beginning of 2007 , which could dampen fragile consumer spending . much of consumers ' apparent new-found willingness to spend reflects plans to bring forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the vat rise , experts say . thus , " the economy risks slipping back into its old lethargy at the start of next year , " diw think tank warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth .

but observers believe activity is set to pick up sharply this year .
top think-tanks such as ifo in munich and diw in berlin have both recently sharply upgraded their 2006 growth forecasts to 1.7 percent . and the government , which was hitherto expecting a modest 1.2 percent , now believes growth will be in a range of 1.5-1.8 percent , economy minister michael glos indicated last week . berlin is scheduled to publish its latest updated growth forecasts on jan .
25 . " we 're sensing an upturn in the economy , " glos said on the sidelines of a working meeting of his conservative csu party in wildbad kreuth in bavaria . a favorable global economic environment is also expected to have a positive effect on the domestic german economy . in an interview with euro am sonntag newspaper , the head of the economics department of the influential german ifo institute , gebhard flaig , said he was even expecting " growth of 1.5-2.0 percent " this year . germany could see a new economic peak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy could reach new heights in the next two years .
indeed , germany could be on the way to reaching " a new economic peak " in the next two years , if the government pressed ahead with the much-needed structural reforms , flaig said . exports are traditionally the main driver of growth in germany and the bga exporters ' federation said this week that exports were likely to expand by 8 percent this year after increasing by 7 percent in 2005 . but the spark of recovery is also expected to jump over to domestic demand , traditionally the achilles ' heel of german growth , experts believe .
in its regular monthly consumer sentiment survey last month , the market research group gfk found that german households were more willing now than they have been in the past four years to go out and spend money . that will come as good news for the retail sector , where business has declined for the past three years and looks to have stagnated in 2005 . labor market conditions also looking rosier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sweet smell of better employment conditions .
conditions in the labor market also appear to be improving - the jobless rate fell to 11.2 percent in december from 11.4 percent in november in seasonally adjusted terms , data showed last week . and in raw or unadjusted terms , the number of people on unemployment benefits increased by just 75,000 to 4.606 million last month , the slowest level increase since unification . indeed , the federal labor agency believes the jobless total could remain below the politically sensitive level of five million in the winter months . caution urged over one-off economic boosts however , some observers believe the positive economic developments will prove short-lived , since they appear to be driven primarily by one-off factors , such as the upcoming world cup soccer championship and a 25-billion-euro -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- public investment program by the government . furthermore , the new government under chancellor angela merkel has said it will raise value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- by three percentage points to 19.0 percent at the beginning of 2007 , which could dampen fragile consumer spending . much of consumers ' apparent new-found willingness to spend reflects plans to bring forward big-ticket purchases ahead of the vat rise , experts say . thus , " the economy risks slipping back into its old lethargy at the start of next year , " diw think tank warned . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world cup to boost german economy a new study by the german chamber of commerce strikes an optimistic note by predicting that the world cup will have a positive impact on germany 's economic growth .

" there is a clear distinction between the g4 draft resolution and the g4 cooperative framework , " shinichi iida , first secretary at japan 's un mission , told afp .
" we do not believe the g4 draft in its current form can garner the necessary support , " he added .
" however the g4 is the driving force behind security council reform and we need the g4 countries to cooperate together . " the latest draft submitted to the un secretariat is similar to one already presented last year by brazil , germany , india and japan which failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the un general assembly .
it calls for boosting the council 's membership from the current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats with no veto power - one for each of the g4 members plus two for the african region - and four new non-permanent seats . but the text met stiff opposition from the united states and china , both permanent veto-wielding members of the council along with britain , france and russia . japan to draw up own proposal while advocating unity japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to washington , its main ally , for securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan is cosying up to the united states - a move that has unsettled its g4 partners .
japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . " we are in serious dialogue with the united states and we are hoping we will be able to come up with a new plan that they can support , " iida said .
" we need us support on a specific plan .
then we will go to the other g4 members and negotiate with them . " " we need both the us and the g4 on board to make council reform happen .
this is a very difficult task , " he said . while washington made it clear last year it supported japan 's bid for permanent council membership , it also adamantly opposed the joint g4 bid . asked why japan was not trying to woo china as well , iida replied : " the us has been forthcoming on un reform and has supported japan 's bid .
this is not the case with china . " " we have started a dialogue with the chinese as well but the discussions with the chinese are fundamentally and substantively different from what we are doing with the americans , " he said . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to join this time , the other three g4 members would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . germany sees japan as " straying from the group " and a german diplomat said tokyo 's g4 partners did not consider that " japan has strayed from the group .
we believe that so far the g4 draft is the best proposal in the sense that it generates the broadest support , " she noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will enter the un debate started by his predecessor .
asked why the g4 as a group was not trying to enlist us support , the german diplomat replied : " we have also addressed the us but so far they chose to speak to the japanese and that 's fine .
we see it as a way of burden-sharing .
if japan thinks they can get the us on board , that 's great and we would welcome it and we also said we 're open to amendments .
we are not aiming for a vote in the immediate future .
so if these talks generate some positive results , then we might amend the text and broaden the support , " she added . iida said his government also felt that it would have been better for the g4 to wait for the 53-member african union -lrb- au -rrb- to clarify its own stand on security council reform at a planned summit later this month . last october , the au , whose support for the g4 proposal is seen as crucial , renewed its demand for a 26-seat security council .
under this scenario , africa would get two of six new permanent seats with veto power as well as two of five new non-permanent seats . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de japan gives up joint g4 bid to reform un security council with japan 's decision to pursue permanent membership on the un security council without its g4 allies , the prospects of germany joining the big guys in the top un body are looking less rosy than ever .

" we do not believe the g4 draft in its current form can garner the necessary support , " he added .
" however the g4 is the driving force behind security council reform and we need the g4 countries to cooperate together .

japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . " we are in serious dialogue with the united states and we are hoping we will be able to come up with a new plan that they can support , " iida said .
" we need us support on a specific plan .
then we will go to the other g4 members and negotiate with them . " " we need both the us and the g4 on board to make council reform happen .
this is a very difficult task , " he said . while washington made it clear last year it supported japan 's bid for permanent council membership , it also adamantly opposed the joint g4 bid . asked why japan was not trying to woo china as well , iida replied : " the us has been forthcoming on un reform and has supported japan 's bid .
this is not the case with china . " " we have started a dialogue with the chinese as well but the discussions with the chinese are fundamentally and substantively different from what we are doing with the americans , " he said . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to join this time , the other three g4 members would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . germany sees japan as " straying from the group " and a german diplomat said tokyo 's g4 partners did not consider that " japan has strayed from the group .

we see it as a way of burden-sharing .

we are not aiming for a vote in the immediate future .

" there is a clear distinction between the g4 draft resolution and the g4 cooperative framework , " shinichi iida , first secretary at japan 's un mission , told afp .
" we do not believe the g4 draft in its current form can garner the necessary support , " he added .
" however the g4 is the driving force behind security council reform and we need the g4 countries to cooperate together . " the latest draft submitted to the un secretariat is similar to one already presented last year by brazil , germany , india and japan which failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the un general assembly .
it calls for boosting the council 's membership from the current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats with no veto power - one for each of the g4 members plus two for the african region - and four new non-permanent seats . but the text met stiff opposition from the united states and china , both permanent veto-wielding members of the council along with britain , france and russia . japan to draw up own proposal while advocating unity japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to washington , its main ally , for securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan is cosying up to the united states - a move that has unsettled its g4 partners .
japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . " we are in serious dialogue with the united states and we are hoping we will be able to come up with a new plan that they can support , " iida said .
" we need us support on a specific plan .
then we will go to the other g4 members and negotiate with them . " " we need both the us and the g4 on board to make council reform happen .
this is a very difficult task , " he said . while washington made it clear last year it supported japan 's bid for permanent council membership , it also adamantly opposed the joint g4 bid . asked why japan was not trying to woo china as well , iida replied : " the us has been forthcoming on un reform and has supported japan 's bid .
this is not the case with china . " " we have started a dialogue with the chinese as well but the discussions with the chinese are fundamentally and substantively different from what we are doing with the americans , " he said . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to join this time , the other three g4 members would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . germany sees japan as " straying from the group " and a german diplomat said tokyo 's g4 partners did not consider that " japan has strayed from the group .
we believe that so far the g4 draft is the best proposal in the sense that it generates the broadest support , " she noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will enter the un debate started by his predecessor .
asked why the g4 as a group was not trying to enlist us support , the german diplomat replied : " we have also addressed the us but so far they chose to speak to the japanese and that 's fine .
we see it as a way of burden-sharing .
if japan thinks they can get the us on board , that 's great and we would welcome it and we also said we 're open to amendments .
we are not aiming for a vote in the immediate future .
so if these talks generate some positive results , then we might amend the text and broaden the support , " she added . iida said his government also felt that it would have been better for the g4 to wait for the 53-member african union -lrb- au -rrb- to clarify its own stand on security council reform at a planned summit later this month . last october , the au , whose support for the g4 proposal is seen as crucial , renewed its demand for a 26-seat security council .
under this scenario , africa would get two of six new permanent seats with veto power as well as two of five new non-permanent seats . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de japan gives up joint g4 bid to reform un security council with japan 's decision to pursue permanent membership on the un security council without its g4 allies , the prospects of germany joining the big guys in the top un body are looking less rosy than ever .

the story of her unprecedented success on the german political scene - part political thriller , part soap opera - should make you think twice before you call somebody a " silly old goose . " while visiting a farm in the german town of lenzen back in 2000 , former chancellor schröder noticed a goose he thought would look pretty nice on his christmas table .
the farm owners were more than happy to accommodate the wishes of their elected leader .
doretta , the goose , received a special ribbon as a mark of distinction among her fellow birds .
she went on cluelessly stuffing herself with whatever food came her way - not knowing , of course , that she was getting her pre-christmas makeover in order to keep the chancellor 's tummy full during the holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta owes her fame to former chancellor schröder and his step daughter klara when schröder , however , went home and told his family about his day , all hell broke loose .
an emergency meeting was convened at the family command room .
due to the sensitivity of the topics discussed , the meeting was closed to the public . but from the information that was leaked to the media , we know that schröder 's stepdaughter klara flatly rejected the chancellor 's report on the goose deal and refused to play any role on the goose slaughtering consortium .
doretta had to be saved . when your stepdad is ruling the country , you do n't take " i ca n't do anything about it " for an answer .
instead , you say " give me a break , daddy .
you 're the chancellor .

doretta , who incidentally turned out to be a gander , but kept proudly using her artistic drag name , was pardoned by the chancellor .
the chancellor 's office sent a yearly appanage for the upkeep of the first first goose in german history .
doretta remained on the farm where she was born , and received just about enough media attention to drive all the other geese mad with jealousy . goosy goosy ga n der , where dost thou wa n der ? life was pretty good for doretta until schröder lost the german elections in sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.01.2006 doretta dethroned : the first goose is loose großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 's remained true to herself : doretta , the former first goose her name is doretta .
the story of her unprecedented success on the german political scene - part political thriller , part soap opera - should make you think twice before you call somebody a " silly old goose . " while visiting a farm in the german town of lenzen back in 2000 , former chancellor schröder noticed a goose he thought would look pretty nice on his christmas table .
the farm owners were more than happy to accommodate the wishes of their elected leader .
doretta , the goose , received a special ribbon as a mark of distinction among her fellow birds .
she went on cluelessly stuffing herself with whatever food came her way - not knowing , of course , that she was getting her pre-christmas makeover in order to keep the chancellor 's tummy full during the holidays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta owes her fame to former chancellor schröder and his step daughter klara when schröder , however , went home and told his family about his day , all hell broke loose .
an emergency meeting was convened at the family command room .
due to the sensitivity of the topics discussed , the meeting was closed to the public . but from the information that was leaked to the media , we know that schröder 's stepdaughter klara flatly rejected the chancellor 's report on the goose deal and refused to play any role on the goose slaughtering consortium .
doretta had to be saved . when your stepdad is ruling the country , you do n't take " i ca n't do anything about it " for an answer .
instead , you say " give me a break , daddy .
you 're the chancellor .
just make it happen . " so he did .
doretta , who incidentally turned out to be a gander , but kept proudly using her artistic drag name , was pardoned by the chancellor .
the chancellor 's office sent a yearly appanage for the upkeep of the first first goose in german history .
doretta remained on the farm where she was born , and received just about enough media attention to drive all the other geese mad with jealousy . goosy goosy ga n der , where dost thou wa n der ? life was pretty good for doretta until schröder lost the german elections in sept .
2005 .
after a prolonged and , at times , embarrassing tug-of-war with his conservative rival angela merkel , schröder conceded , and merkel became the first female chancellor in german history .
all of a sudden , doretta was in trouble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former first goose is not a priority on chancellor merkel 's agenda the parliamentary office of the former chancellor stated that the payments for doretta 's upkeep " were limited to -lrb- schröder 's -rrb- chancellorship and would not be continued . " angela merkel 's spokesperson said that doretta was a " topic that frau merkel will not be concerned with . " when asked by tv reporters if she would take over the responsibility of caring for the first goose , angela merkel herself said she believed doretta was " in good hands . " what these statements amount to - once you remove the obfuscating layer of diplomatic lingo - is that everybody was bailing out on poor old doretta . a celebrity for life doretta was , however , meant for more than 15 minutes of fame .
after being described by some analysts as the paris hilton of german geese , doretta is now giving up a life of mindless glamour to get a full-time job with the berlin association " life with animals . "
the organization is a proponent of animal-assisted therapy : it helps people in need improve their physical , social , emotional and cognitive functions by interacting with animals . in other words , no more wild goose chases for this silly old goose . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doretta 's celebrity friends : damon , the dog and fuchs , the cat from the german pet fame academy doretta will go down in history as a controversial , gender-bending first goose , who does n't just live off of its past glory .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.01.2006 government retreats to re-think germany 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " red " and " black " members of government get cozy in genshagen the german government is holding a two-day strategy meeting meant to bring both sides of the " grand coalition " into harmony .
among other things , ministers will deal with a planned multi-billion investment program . the time has come for germany 's grand coalition to prove that it can really move the country forward .
at the center of the berlin cabinet 's most urgent tasks this year are measures to revive the flagging domestic job market .
unemployment is still only slightly below the five million mark . the difficult task ahead will be to boost consumer spending without losing sight of the larger aim : budget consolidation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is hoping the investment program will help boost construction in their coalition treaty , the christian democratic / christian social union bloc -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and its social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- partner agreed on a special 25 ­ ­ -billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2 billion -rrb- investment program in 2006 to promote employment and growth through more funding for research , improved infrastructure , more support for families and favorable tax treatment for capital investment and home improvement . at their two-day strategy meeting at genshagen castle near berlin , cabinet ministers are hoping to send out a signal of harmony and resolve without sacrificing the profile of the mainstream parties they represent . this in itself seems like squaring the circle .
an added irritation is the fact that some major policy issues have been the subjects of heated debate even within both the spd and the cdu / csu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering and angela merkel spd general secretary hubertus heil at the weekend suggested that 25 billion euros for fresh investment would be too little .
but spd labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering hastened to assure the media that the original agreement will remain intact . " i take it that we 'll stick to the 25 billion euros we agreed on in the coalition treaty , " he said .
" we simply have to bear in mind the interests of our finance minister who 's out to consolidate the budget in the medium-term .
the 25 million euros from the state will free more resources in private business .
so , the impact of the investment program will be even bigger . " disagreement over low-wage sector another controversial issue is how to improve conditions for employment in the low-wage sector .
the christian democrats are in favor of granting state subsidies to top up wages and to motivate people to accept relatively low-paid jobs rather than staying at home and living on unemployment benefits . cdu labor affairs spokesman ronald pofalla said he thinks that such a policy makes perfect sense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part-time waiters might benefit from wage subsidies " we believe that the wage subsidies will not turn out to be a major financial burden on state coffers , " he said .
" it 'll be less money than we 'd have to spend otherwise on unemployment benefits . " but social democratic ministers fear that these so-called combined wages could have unforeseeable financial consequences and could lead to a reduction of regular jobs . a nuclear future ? cabinet ministers will also be debating the government 's future energy strategy .
a heated dispute has broken out over whether germany should really phase out nuclear energy completely as decided by the previous government under former chancellor gerhard schröder . the controversy broke out after the recent gas dispute between russia and ukraine fuelled fears about germany 's increased dependence on gas imports from russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in stade in northern germany was the first to be switched off in 2003 conservative economics minister michael glos is among the staunchest supporters of rethinking germany 's nuclear energy policy .
some of his fellow conservatives now even in favor of building new nuclear power plants . these are only some of the issues which are bound to cause some friction at the strategy meeting .
but glos is confident everything can be sorted out in a constructive manner without jeopardizing the governing coalition 's clout . " marriages of convenience often last longer than those based on love , " he said . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when not working is the best option how do you make low-paying jobs more attractive than the public dole ?

unemployment is still only slightly below the five million mark . the difficult task ahead will be to boost consumer spending without losing sight of the larger aim : budget consolidation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is hoping the investment program will help boost construction in their coalition treaty , the christian democratic / christian social union bloc -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- and its social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- partner agreed on a special 25 ­ ­ -billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2 billion -rrb- investment program in 2006 to promote employment and growth through more funding for research , improved infrastructure , more support for families and favorable tax treatment for capital investment and home improvement . at their two-day strategy meeting at genshagen castle near berlin , cabinet ministers are hoping to send out a signal of harmony and resolve without sacrificing the profile of the mainstream parties they represent . this in itself seems like squaring the circle .

but spd labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering hastened to assure the media that the original agreement will remain intact . " i take it that we 'll stick to the 25 billion euros we agreed on in the coalition treaty , " he said .
" we simply have to bear in mind the interests of our finance minister who 's out to consolidate the budget in the medium-term .
the 25 million euros from the state will free more resources in private business .
so , the impact of the investment program will be even bigger . " disagreement over low-wage sector another controversial issue is how to improve conditions for employment in the low-wage sector .
the christian democrats are in favor of granting state subsidies to top up wages and to motivate people to accept relatively low-paid jobs rather than staying at home and living on unemployment benefits . cdu labor affairs spokesman ronald pofalla said he thinks that such a policy makes perfect sense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part-time waiters might benefit from wage subsidies " we believe that the wage subsidies will not turn out to be a major financial burden on state coffers , " he said .
" it 'll be less money than we 'd have to spend otherwise on unemployment benefits . " but social democratic ministers fear that these so-called combined wages could have unforeseeable financial consequences and could lead to a reduction of regular jobs . a nuclear future ? cabinet ministers will also be debating the government 's future energy strategy .
a heated dispute has broken out over whether germany should really phase out nuclear energy completely as decided by the previous government under former chancellor gerhard schröder . the controversy broke out after the recent gas dispute between russia and ukraine fuelled fears about germany 's increased dependence on gas imports from russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuclear power plant in stade in northern germany was the first to be switched off in 2003 conservative economics minister michael glos is among the staunchest supporters of rethinking germany 's nuclear energy policy .

tuition costs 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,430 -rrb- , which students pay with help from their employers , scholarships or out of their own pockets . the university , which also has campuses in munich and near cologne , was first started in 2002 with the backing of some of germany 's top companies , including automaker daimlerchrysler and insurance giant allianz , to improve the standards of germany 's business education and provide german corporations with an increased pool of well-trained labor .
the new berlin branch is accredited by the city-state 's senate . the school is the latest among a handful of private universities to open their doors in germany in the past five years , all of which offer courses in business , among other subjects . billions for research and development the new institution started up as polls continued to show that german universities rank unfavorably against their counterparts abroad .
in a times higher educational supplement survey of the best 200 international universities in 2004 , the highest ranking of a german university was heidelberg at place 47 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even heidelberg university does n't rank high internationally such findings , a brain drain of academics and the poor financial shape of many german universities have been fueling a debate in germany on how to improve education , including creating " elite " universities or charging tuition . last month , the german government decided to spend an additional 6 billion euros in research and development by the end of 2009 .
the plans for the next four years are expected to be finalized by mid-february and focus on life science , health , and nano- and automotive technologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students say no to tuition fees the previous government of social democrats and greens had agreed with germany 's 16 federal states to spend 1.9 billion euros over six years to improve the country 's academic institutions .
the federal government was to contribute 75 percent of the money .
the plan represented a compromise between federal and state governments after the latter had opposed a federal push for 10 elite universities throughout the country . voting with their feet meanwhile , students expressed a variety of academic preferences . when asked what institutions they favored , students said they preferred business education in cologne , münster , düsseldorf and mannheim , according to a recent poll by spiegel online web site .
law students were partial to bochum and hamburg , disdaining berlin 's universities .
would-be doctors chose humboldt university in berlin , cologne , münster , heidelberg and freiburg as their top choices and rejected such universities as those in greifswald , geissen and homburg-saar . the preferred universities were chosen based on academic quality but also on the places students wanted to live .
the poll was carried out in cooperation with the german office that handles students ' requests for transfers to other institutions . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german education an export hit in the arab world while germans continue to bemoan their educational system , german higher education is being successfully exported to the arab world .

" there is a clear distinction between the g4 draft resolution and the g4 cooperative framework , " shinichi iida , first secretary at japan 's un mission , told afp .
" we do not believe the g4 draft in its current form can garner the necessary support , " he added .
" however the g4 is the driving force behind security council reform and we need the g4 countries to cooperate together . " the latest draft submitted to the un secretariat is similar to one already presented last year by brazil , germany , india and japan which failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the un general assembly .
it calls for boosting the council 's membership from the current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats with no veto power - one for each of the g4 members plus two for the african region - and four new non-permanent seats . but the text met stiff opposition from the united states and china , both permanent veto-wielding members of the council along with britain , france and russia . japan to draw up own proposal while advocating unity japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to washington , its main ally , for securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan is cosying up to the united states - a move that has unsettled its g4 partners .
japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . " we are in serious dialogue with the united states and we are hoping we will be able to come up with a new plan that they can support , " iida said .
" we need us support on a specific plan .
then we will go to the other g4 members and negotiate with them . " " we need both the us and the g4 on board to make council reform happen .
this is a very difficult task , " he said . while washington made it clear last year it supported japan 's bid for permanent council membership , it also adamantly opposed the joint g4 bid . asked why japan was not trying to woo china as well , iida replied : " the us has been forthcoming on un reform and has supported japan 's bid .
this is not the case with china . " " we have started a dialogue with the chinese as well but the discussions with the chinese are fundamentally and substantively different from what we are doing with the americans , " he said . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to join this time , the other three g4 members would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . germany sees japan as " straying from the group " and a german diplomat said tokyo 's g4 partners did not consider that " japan has strayed from the group .
we believe that so far the g4 draft is the best proposal in the sense that it generates the broadest support , " she noted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will enter the un debate started by his predecessor .
asked why the g4 as a group was not trying to enlist us support , the german diplomat replied : " we have also addressed the us but so far they chose to speak to the japanese and that 's fine .
we see it as a way of burden-sharing .
if japan thinks they can get the us on board , that 's great and we would welcome it and we also said we 're open to amendments .
we are not aiming for a vote in the immediate future .
so if these talks generate some positive results , then we might amend the text and broaden the support , " she added . iida said his government also felt that it would have been better for the g4 to wait for the 53-member african union -lrb- au -rrb- to clarify its own stand on security council reform at a planned summit later this month . last october , the au , whose support for the g4 proposal is seen as crucial , renewed its demand for a 26-seat security council .
under this scenario , africa would get two of six new permanent seats with veto power as well as two of five new non-permanent seats . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de japan gives up joint g4 bid to reform un security council with japan 's decision to pursue permanent membership on the un security council without its g4 allies , the prospects of germany joining the big guys in the top un body are looking less rosy than ever .

the cia is irritated . a fax sent by the egyptian foreign ministry to its embassy in london stated that more than 20 iraqis and afghans had been questioned at a us-run base in romania , a swiss newspaper reported on sunday . sonntagsblick said the swiss secret services obtained a copy of the fax which revealed that the egyptian embassy in london " learned from its own sources that 23 iraqi and afghan citizens had been questioned at the mikhail kogalniceanu base in the town of constanza on the black sea coast .

however , because the report is meant to be secret , the ministry refused to comment on its contents . categorical denials a senior officer at the mikhail kogalniceanu base categorically denied the report on sunday . " i have been working at this base since 1995 and i have never been aware of such an operation , " officer dan buciuman said . he added that the base was open to " anyone who wants to carry out an investigation . " amid protests from european governments that their airports are being used by the central intelligence agency to transport suspects , the united states has not denied the existence of alleged prisons in eastern and central europe and elsewhere , but has refuted allegations that it uses torture to obtain information . just in time us television network abc reported in december that the us had held 11 senior members of the al qaeda network in poland but that they were evacuated to north africa shortly before us secretary of state condoleezza rice toured europe that month .

government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "

puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .

around 650,000 people in low-paying jobs receive additional government support of around 350 euros -lrb- $ 425 -rrb- a month , said alexander spermann of the economic research institute zew in mannheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer wants a wage subsidy as soon as early 2007 additional subsidies could entice people to accept low-paying jobs , said spermann , but they also have the potential to become " economic black holes . "
conservative estimates by the german economic research institute reported a wage subsidy model benefiting 100,000 unemployed people costing 4 billion euros .
sorting out a confusing discussion " according to our analysis , the government could n't afford something like this , " said brencke .
wage subsidy advocates like spermann say there is financial playing room for such a plan if the government forces people to accept low-paying jobs before qualifying for full welfare benefits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there enough room in the budget to finance low-paying jobs ?
but the current debate is almost as confusing as the byzantine models tested by various german states in the past , say experts , adding that the government - although on the right track - needs to get its facts straight .

government politicians say they have the answer .
economists wonder how they ’ ll pay for it . of germany 's 4.6 million unemployed , more than 3 million have it tougher than most .
they have no formal training or education , qualifying themselves for little more than service sector jobs that pay less than what they would be getting on germany 's still-generous public dole .
now they have the ear of germany ’ s political elite .
spurred on by president horst köhler , members of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrat union began calling for a wage subsidy model that would entice those with little to no job training to trade the couch for the workplace .
the union 's parliamentary economic expert , laurenz meyer , said the government is considering introducing such a model nationally at the beginning of 2007 .
the goal is to bring down unemployment - hovering at around 11 percent - and save billions of euros in benefits those people currently receive . re-heating a decades-old idea " almost three million unemployed people have no formal job training .
but there still needs to be work for them , " said köhler in a pre-new year ’ s interview with newsmagazine stern .
" they can ’ t live from a low wage , so we need to increase their income .
that ’ s the job of the state . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler : helping the unqualified is the job of the state since köhler re-heated the idea of a wage subsidy model - something that ’ s been tested regionally in various forms for more than a decade - the criticism has come quickly .
puzzled economic analysts say that a version of the wage subsidy already exists , while others question why the government would introduce a model that has yet to prove itself .
" we 've already had this discussion , " said karl brenke , economist at the german institute for economic research in berlin .
in 2001 , a wage subsidy model was tested out in mainz .
it ultimately failed because it was too complicated and not attractive enough to get people off of welfare and into low-paying work , say experts .

analysis by nick assinder political correspondent , bbc news website sir menzies campbell and simon hughes are influential party figures few doubt that one of the major factors in charles kennedy 's political assassination was the escalating debate over the liberal democrats ' future direction .
it is even suggested that members of one or other of the different camps were directly responsible for whipping up the crisis which led to mr kennedy 's resignation .
the issue was undoubtedly brought to a head by the election of david cameron as tory leader , with an agenda aimed squarely at whipping the electoral rug from under the lib dems .
but the tensions between the two wings of the party have been there since the merger of the liberals and the old sdp and have sharpened with the election of a new breed of lib dem mps .
so , now mr kennedy has gone , the party faces a pretty fundamental choice .
most seem to agree that the last thing the party needs is to proceed in any direction that would take them off the centre ground where they can attract votes from both labour and the tories nick assinder it boils down , crudely , to one of left and right , between so-called social liberals and economic liberals , even traditionalists and modernisers .
on the left , traditional wing are the social liberals who tend to be those , often old liberals , who emphasise issues like civil liberties and state-run public services , and who place less emphasis on the market .
they are often characterised as the " tax and spend " wing of the party , which wants to drive it to the left of labour .
current party president and likely leadership contender simon hughes is seen as the leader of that wing , but has warned against putting simplistic left / right labels on people .
the other , modernising group comprises those often young , new intake mps who have gathered around the orange book - a series of essays suggesting a more right wing direction for the party .
dealing with a resurgent tory party under david cameron will be crucial the book was co-edited by david laws , the former city high flier who is the party 's work and pensions spokesman , and includes suggestions on greater private involvement in the nhs , less power for the eu and a distinctly more liberal approach to the economy .
most seem to agree that the last thing the party needs is to proceed in any direction that would take them off the centre ground where they can attract votes from both labour and the tories .
mr kennedy always resisted being branded as the new left wing influence in the commons but was equally opposed to any significant attempt to take on the tories on their own agenda .
now the tories have started to change that agenda , the issue can no longer be avoided .
much of the current emphasis tends to be on those tory voters who , if they return to their old polling habits , can deny the lib dems any further advances nick assinder there is , of course , the option of attempting to reconcile the two trains of thought to forge a new liberal democrat agenda that will continue to attract both labour and tory voters .
much of the current emphasis tends to be on those tory voters who , if they return to their old polling habits , can deny the lib dems any further advances and even pitch them back to the old days of minority status .
but keeping them on board and attracting even more of them while not turning off disillusioned labour voters - particularly when the iraq war issue will have faded - is the trick .
sir menzies campbell and his band of supporters hope that he may be the man to do that .
he retains the respect of both wings and , over the years , has described himself as a liberal " with a capital l " - specifically citing social issues - but has also expressed support for a new , patient-led approach to the nhs supported by the right of the party .
whatever the outcome of the leadership contest , the new leader will have to address this issue as one of his or her first tasks .

analysis by nick assinder political correspondent , bbc news website sir menzies campbell and simon hughes are influential party figures few doubt that one of the major factors in charles kennedy 's political assassination was the escalating debate over the liberal democrats ' future direction .
it is even suggested that members of one or other of the different camps were directly responsible for whipping up the crisis which led to mr kennedy 's resignation .
the issue was undoubtedly brought to a head by the election of david cameron as tory leader , with an agenda aimed squarely at whipping the electoral rug from under the lib dems .
but the tensions between the two wings of the party have been there since the merger of the liberals and the old sdp and have sharpened with the election of a new breed of lib dem mps .
so , now mr kennedy has gone , the party faces a pretty fundamental choice .
most seem to agree that the last thing the party needs is to proceed in any direction that would take them off the centre ground where they can attract votes from both labour and the tories nick assinder it boils down , crudely , to one of left and right , between so-called social liberals and economic liberals , even traditionalists and modernisers .
on the left , traditional wing are the social liberals who tend to be those , often old liberals , who emphasise issues like civil liberties and state-run public services , and who place less emphasis on the market .
they are often characterised as the " tax and spend " wing of the party , which wants to drive it to the left of labour .
current party president and likely leadership contender simon hughes is seen as the leader of that wing , but has warned against putting simplistic left / right labels on people .
the other , modernising group comprises those often young , new intake mps who have gathered around the orange book - a series of essays suggesting a more right wing direction for the party .
dealing with a resurgent tory party under david cameron will be crucial the book was co-edited by david laws , the former city high flier who is the party 's work and pensions spokesman , and includes suggestions on greater private involvement in the nhs , less power for the eu and a distinctly more liberal approach to the economy .
most seem to agree that the last thing the party needs is to proceed in any direction that would take them off the centre ground where they can attract votes from both labour and the tories .
mr kennedy always resisted being branded as the new left wing influence in the commons but was equally opposed to any significant attempt to take on the tories on their own agenda .
now the tories have started to change that agenda , the issue can no longer be avoided .
much of the current emphasis tends to be on those tory voters who , if they return to their old polling habits , can deny the lib dems any further advances nick assinder there is , of course , the option of attempting to reconcile the two trains of thought to forge a new liberal democrat agenda that will continue to attract both labour and tory voters .
much of the current emphasis tends to be on those tory voters who , if they return to their old polling habits , can deny the lib dems any further advances and even pitch them back to the old days of minority status .
but keeping them on board and attracting even more of them while not turning off disillusioned labour voters - particularly when the iraq war issue will have faded - is the trick .
sir menzies campbell and his band of supporters hope that he may be the man to do that .
he retains the respect of both wings and , over the years , has described himself as a liberal " with a capital l " - specifically citing social issues - but has also expressed support for a new , patient-led approach to the nhs supported by the right of the party .

analysis by nick assinder political correspondent , bbc news website few doubt that one of the major factors in charles kennedy 's political assassination was the escalating debate over the liberal democrats ' future direction .
it is even suggested that members of one or other of the different camps were directly responsible for whipping up the crisis which led to mr kennedy 's resignation .
the issue was undoubtedly brought to a head by the election of david cameron as tory leader , with an agenda aimed squarely at whipping the electoral rug from under the lib dems .
but the tensions between the two wings of the party have been there since the merger of the liberals and the old sdp and have sharpened with the election of a new breed of lib dem mps .
so , now mr kennedy has gone , the party faces a pretty fundamental choice . "
most seem to agree that the last thing the party needs is to proceed in any direction that would take them off the centre ground where they can attract votes from both labour and the tories " nick assinder it boils down , crudely , to one of left and right , between so-called social liberals and economic liberals , even traditionalists and modernisers .
on the left , traditional wing are the social liberals who tend to be those , often old liberals , who emphasise issues like civil liberties and state-run public services , and who place less emphasis on the market .
they are often characterised as the " tax and spend " wing of the party , which wants to drive it to the left of labour .
current party president and likely leadership contender simon hughes is seen as the leader of that wing , but has warned against putting simplistic left / right labels on people .
the other , modernising group comprises those often young , new intake mps who have gathered around the orange book - a series of essays suggesting a more right wing direction for the party .
the book was co-edited by david laws , the former city high flier who is the party 's work and pensions spokesman , and includes suggestions on greater private involvement in the nhs , less power for the eu and a distinctly more liberal approach to the economy .
most seem to agree that the last thing the party needs is to proceed in any direction that would take them off the centre ground where they can attract votes from both labour and the tories .
mr kennedy always resisted being branded as the new left wing influence in the commons but was equally opposed to any significant attempt to take on the tories on their own agenda .
now the tories have started to change that agenda , the issue can no longer be avoided . "
much of the current emphasis tends to be on those tory voters who , if they return to their old polling habits , can deny the lib dems any further advances " nick assinder there is , of course , the option of attempting to reconcile the two trains of thought to forge a new liberal democrat agenda that will continue to attract both labour and tory voters .

that is one of the conclusions of a new report from research firm forrester .
the study finds that a gradual evolution in the gaming industry is more likely than a revolution in the way people play games and use consoles .
although gaming is a huge industry , the report warned that turning a profit will become increasingly difficult .
for players such as microsoft , sony and nintendo the fact that the market is reaching saturation point coupled with the increasing costs of producing both games and consoles means profit margins may not be a big as they would like .
in-game advertising increasingly brands such as red bull are advertising in games the report also warned that mobile phones and portable media players could supersede portable games consoles such as the nintendo ds and sony psp .
" -lsb- portable game consoles -rsb- look like one-trick ponies compared with multifunctional mobile phones that play games or game-capable portable media players .
they could well be replaced in consumers ' pockets , " said report author paul jackson .
convergence of devices has been the main theme of the recent consumer electronics show in las vegas but mr jackson is not convinced the role of entertainment hub will be played by gaming consoles .
" while gamers will increasingly use their new consoles for non-gaming activities , this functionality will not be enough to convince non-gamers that buying a console is the answer to their digital convergence dreams , " he said .
game firms need to find new sources of making money as the costs of making both games and consoles rockets and the market becomes saturated , the report found .
designing games for a wider audience , embracing online gaming subscription models and offering more in-game advertising are all ways of doing this , it suggested .

according to the npd group , the industry generated $ 9.9bn in the us in 2004 and video gaming is stretching its influence with tv programmes , movie tie-ins and video game soundtracks .
gaming is a multi-billion dollar industry it remains dominated by young males - and forrester found that in the us 77 % of 16-25 year-old males regularly play video games .
among the 12-17 age group , the figures are even higher - with a staggering 94 % regularly indulging in game playing .
visions of inclusive gaming - engaging those with no history or interest in gaming - remains some way off , mr jackson thinks .
" more young female gamers will use portable and home console platforms ; older gamers will tap into game subscription services and casual multiplayer games like poker or bridge but it will only have an incremental effect on the industry , " he said .
the report predicted good times ahead for the pc gaming industry which , following several years of revenue declines , will once again start to grow .
despite the hype around games consoles , more consumers still play games on a home pc than on a game console with the exception of gamers in the uk , france and spain , the report said .
broadband gaming subscription services and mass-market online games will drive more consumers to their pcs and in the next two years forrester predicts that another 4 % of households will have taken up gaming in both the us and europe .
currently 40 % of us households and 27 % of european households indulge in pc gaming .
the growth in popularity of pc gaming is not a guarantee of profit though .
in fact many pc gamers play free online games and are unlikely to invest in new , full-price , boxed games or subscribe to game services , the report found .
currently 15 % of european consumers online consumers and 46 % of us online consumers play web-based games .

game firms need to find new sources of making money as the costs of making both games and consoles rockets and the market becomes saturated , the report found .
designing games for a wider audience , embracing online gaming subscription models and offering more in-game advertising are all ways of doing this , it suggested .
male preserve gaming remains a multi-billion dollar industry and its influence can not be underestimated .
according to the npd group , the industry generated $ 9.9bn in the us in 2004 and video gaming is stretching its influence with tv programmes , movie tie-ins and video game soundtracks .
gaming is a multi-billion dollar industry it remains dominated by young males - and forrester found that in the us 77 % of 16-25 year-old males regularly play video games .
among the 12-17 age group , the figures are even higher - with a staggering 94 % regularly indulging in game playing .
visions of inclusive gaming - engaging those with no history or interest in gaming - remains some way off , mr jackson thinks .
" more young female gamers will use portable and home console platforms ; older gamers will tap into game subscription services and casual multiplayer games like poker or bridge but it will only have an incremental effect on the industry , " he said .
the report predicted good times ahead for the pc gaming industry which , following several years of revenue declines , will once again start to grow .
despite the hype around games consoles , more consumers still play games on a home pc than on a game console with the exception of gamers in the uk , france and spain , the report said .
broadband gaming subscription services and mass-market online games will drive more consumers to their pcs and in the next two years forrester predicts that another 4 % of households will have taken up gaming in both the us and europe .
currently 40 % of us households and 27 % of european households indulge in pc gaming .
the growth in popularity of pc gaming is not a guarantee of profit though .
in fact many pc gamers play free online games and are unlikely to invest in new , full-price , boxed games or subscribe to game services , the report found .
currently 15 % of european consumers online consumers and 46 % of us online consumers play web-based games .
these range from simple multi-player card , golf or racing games to more sophisticated games such as world of warcraft .

for the first time , web giants google and yahoo took their place alongside the big names in consumer electronics , such as sony , samsung and toshiba .
it seems ironic that companies which have made a name for themselves by providing services should outshine others at the annual consumer electronics show -lrb- ces -rrb- .
but google and yahoo are seen as changing the way people access music or video and other forms of media .
and the makers of mp3 players , digital video recorders and other gadgets use to consume media want to make sure they are not left behind .
media reinvention google and yahoo made up a relatively small part of the 1.6 million square feet of exhibition space in las vegas .
inside one of the halls , google had a colourful stand , while outside yahoo held court in a tent in the car park .
they proved one of the most popular destinations for many of the 130,000 people who came to ces to get a glimpse of the future .
the dominant theme at the show was how to make it easier for people to have access to the kind of content they want , when they want it and where they want it .
this is exactly where net services such as google and yahoo have succeeded .
at ces they effectively repositioned themselves as media companies , announcing a host of deals that go beyond their roots in search .
these include providing tv shows and video to computers and mobiles , as well as linking up web services with traditional consumer electronic products such as the tv .
google announces its online video store , which it hopes will become a full-fledged digital warehouse of media .
as part of the store , it reached agreement with us network cbs to offer hit shows like csi and survivor for $ 1.99 .
" we 're really the enabler , " said google boss eric schmidt in a briefing with journalists at ces .
" the important thing is to get the content out .
digital information should be available on every device all of the time . "
fun and games not to be left behind , yahoo announced software that would enable its 450 million users to access their e-mail , photos , search and more from a tv or mobile phone .
" we are taking our essential services and connecting them to people 's lives using their devices , " marco boerries , yahoo 's senior vice president for connected life , told the bbc news website .

the meeting of bishops in leeds will debate a document that reportedly backs the controversial move .
the times reports that a woman could be consecrated by 2012 under proposals in a leaked copy of the document .
the document also proposes allowing new regional bishops for parishes that choose to opt out of the care of a woman bishop , the report says .
' strong views ' the document is due to be published next week and debated by the church of england general synod in february .
a church of england spokesman said : " this is a debate which has been long-running and lots of people within the church have strong views at either end of the spectrum .
" i would not think the publication of this report compounds any of this , really . "
bbc religious affairs correspondent robert pigott has said those opposing women bishops are insisting on the creation of a separate division of the church with male-only clergy .
and bishops who advocate the consecration of women and were once prepared to vote for a compromise plan say they intend to push for outright equality for women , with no concessions .
a compromise plan had been thought to offer parishes who object to women bishops a male traditionalist instead .
global row a row over the ordination of openly gay priests has led the worldwide anglican communion to the brink of schism .
in november last year the archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams , warned against internal tensions over homosexuality and the appointment of women bishops .
head to head : women bishops his comments came months after the church of england decided to remove the legal blocks stopping women becoming bishops .
he told members of the general synod they should beware of " poisoning the wells " and ought to conduct debates without hostility .
when women were first ordained church of england priests in 1994 , about 400 anglican clergy became roman catholics in protest .
there are now more than 2,000 women anglican priests .
their supporters believe it is illogical and unfair to continue to bar them from becoming bishops .
opposition camps the opposition to women bishops falls into two separate camps .
the catholic wing of the anglican church focuses on jesus ' choice of only men to be his apostles , insisting that it is a clear sign that clergy should also be male .
meanwhile , conservative evangelicals maintain that the bible prohibits women from leadership in the church .
fourteen of the world 's 38 anglican churches have already decided to allow women bishops .

even some of the people who work for them have never heard of these immensely powerful companies , with names such as apax , blackstone , cvc capital , candover and permira .
yet these private equity companies are gradually becoming a dominant force in the uk economy .
already , they have acquired a slew of uk household names such as kwik-fit , debenhams , somerfield , halfords and the aa .
and with billions more to spend in 2006 , their shopping list is reported to include banking group lloyds tsb , betting firm ladbrokes , music company emi and broadcaster itv .
gloom ahead the private equity industry 's rapacious hunger for bigger and more audacious deals led to a huge swathe of corporate mergers and acquisitions in 2005 .
this helped propel the london markets , pushing the ftse 100 index of leading shares up 16 % and boosting the value of share portfolios and pension funds .
the private equity firms also earned millions in fees for advisors , bankers and accountants .
but many people are now whispering that this secretive and increasingly important driver of the equity and debt markets could be heading for a major dip .
bargain hunters to understand why , it is important to understand how private equity groups work .
in many ways , they operate just like house buyers .
they are looking for bargains : businesses that are undervalued on the stock market or by their owners , companies that are in need of a little " tlc " , and firms in up-and-coming areas with real potential .
they usually stump up a bit of money , a deposit , up front , then rely on the bank to lend them the rest .
but unlike most homeowners , private equity firms do not settle in .
they are looking for a quick , profitable sale , usually within three to seven years .
and they do things in relative privacy , often de-listing their acquisitions if they were quoted on any stock market .
this means they can make tough or controversial decisions without having to run the gauntlet of angry shareholders , and without releasing sensitive information because of stock market disclosure rules .
hence they are accountable only to small groups of private investors and lenders , rather than to stock market investors and company employees , and they do not have to release information to journalists making enquiries into their affairs .
such apparent lack of accountability has , perhaps unsurprisingly , stirred up considerable resentment from some politicians and business leaders - not just in the uk , but internationally too .
raiders or saviours ?
private equity groups have been around in one form or another for decades , with groups like slater-walker in the 1960s and hanson trust in the 1980s .
such firms became some of the first " conglomerates " , hunting down complacent companies and then transforming them with a ruthless devotion to cost-cutting and cash-generation .
some saw them as corporate saviours , reviving firms and delivering big returns to shareholders .
others denounced them as corporate raiders and asset-strippers , only interested in quick profits .
today 's private equity firms are after even bigger prey , and tend to buy from each other or via the stock market , rather than by funding management buy-outs .
but the same arguments are still around .
" they get flak for being rape and pillage merchants , " observes geoff cullinan , senior private equity adviser at consultants bain and company , before launching a staunch defence of the private equity firms . "
but if they do get rich , they only do it by making better companies . "
pension fund gamblers today 's private equity conglomerates can also produce big rewards for their backers , which sometimes include pension fund managers or other large , institutional investors .
investment fund managers tend to see such deals as high-risk gambles , though high risk can bring about high returns .
consequently , they often direct a proportion of their portfolios towards such investment in order to outperform stock and bond markets .
a private equity group took over somerfield for £ 1.1bn in december fund managers typically invest about 3-4 % of their capital in private equity funds .
but this money is spread thinly around the private equity industry when compared with the amount of money borrowed from banks .
research by investment bank merrill lynch says that banks will lend around £ 100bn for european deals over the next three years .
private equity groups rely on profits from the companies they have bought to pay off such debts .
traditionally , they borrow an average of five times the underlying profits of the company they want to buy .
some industry watchers say the level has now risen to an all-time high average of eight times profits .
walking the tightrope the more money a private equity group borrows , the bigger the target it can bid for , and the greater the potential profits if it can improve its performance .
again , it 's like buying a house .
the people who make money in a property boom are those who push themselves by taking out a bigger mortgage .
if they sell when the market is rising , they make a profit .
if the downturn hits before they have offloaded , the debt repayments can overpower them .
private equity-owned debenhams doubled its profits last year the last time the debt-to-equity ratio was so high was in the late 1980s , when many private equity investments were hit by the eventual economic downturn and rising interest rates .
" it was a tightrope that many people fell off , " says mr cullinan .
he thinks history could be about to repeat itself .
many feel that there are now too many private equity groups chasing potential deals and competing with other companies on the acquisition trail .
" when people have too much money to spend , they start overpaying , " agrees richard sachar , chief executive of private equity advisers almeida capital .
inevitable slowdown there are some indications that it has already started to happen .
in the space of a week last december , two private equity-owned retail chains - off-licence unwins and cd and dvd retailer mvc - called in the administrators .
such stories might suggest that the golden days of private equity will soon be over , but the facts do n't yet support this view .
interest rates are low , stock markets are rising and the total number of private equity receiverships fell in 2005 .
but according to mr cullinan , a readjustment is inevitable .
you ca n't have a period of rapid growth without a slowdown at the end of it , and history repeats itself , he argues .
" the history of private equity is one of exponential growth , followed by a crash , then growth again . "

even some of the people who work for them have never heard of these immensely powerful companies , with names such as apax , blackstone , cvc capital , candover and permira .
yet these private equity companies are gradually becoming a dominant force in the uk economy .
already , they have acquired a slew of uk household names such as kwik-fit , debenhams , somerfield , halfords and the aa .
and with billions more to spend in 2006 , their shopping list is reported to include banking group lloyds tsb , betting firm ladbrokes , music company emi and broadcaster itv .
gloom ahead the private equity industry 's rapacious hunger for bigger and more audacious deals led to a huge swathe of corporate mergers and acquisitions in 2005 .
this helped propel the london markets , pushing the ftse 100 index of leading shares up 16 % and boosting the value of share portfolios and pension funds .
the private equity firms also earned millions in fees for advisors , bankers and accountants .
but many people are now whispering that this secretive and increasingly important driver of the equity and debt markets could be heading for a major dip .
bargain hunters to understand why , it is important to understand how private equity groups work .
in many ways , they operate just like house buyers .
they are looking for bargains : businesses that are undervalued on the stock market or by their owners , companies that are in need of a little " tlc " , and firms in up-and-coming areas with real potential .
they usually stump up a bit of money , a deposit , up front , then rely on the bank to lend them the rest .
but unlike most homeowners , private equity firms do not settle in .
they are looking for a quick , profitable sale , usually within three to seven years .
and they do things in relative privacy , often de-listing their acquisitions if they were quoted on any stock market .
this means they can make tough or controversial decisions without having to run the gauntlet of angry shareholders , and without releasing sensitive information because of stock market disclosure rules .
hence they are accountable only to small groups of private investors and lenders , rather than to stock market investors and company employees , and they do not have to release information to journalists making enquiries into their affairs .
such apparent lack of accountability has , perhaps unsurprisingly , stirred up considerable resentment from some politicians and business leaders - not just in the uk , but internationally too .
raiders or saviours ?
private equity groups have been around in one form or another for decades , with groups like slater-walker in the 1960s and hanson trust in the 1980s .
such firms became some of the first " conglomerates " , hunting down complacent companies and then transforming them with a ruthless devotion to cost-cutting and cash-generation .
some saw them as corporate saviours , reviving firms and delivering big returns to shareholders .
others denounced them as corporate raiders and asset-strippers , only interested in quick profits .
today 's private equity firms are after even bigger prey , and tend to buy from each other or via the stock market , rather than by funding management buy-outs .
but the same arguments are still around .
" they get flak for being rape and pillage merchants , " observes geoff cullinan , senior private equity adviser at consultants bain and company , before launching a staunch defence of the private equity firms . "
but if they do get rich , they only do it by making better companies . "
pension fund gamblers today 's private equity conglomerates can also produce big rewards for their backers , which sometimes include pension fund managers or other large , institutional investors .
investment fund managers tend to see such deals as high-risk gambles , though high risk can bring about high returns .
consequently , they often direct a proportion of their portfolios towards such investment in order to outperform stock and bond markets .
a private equity group took over somerfield for £ 1.1bn in december fund managers typically invest about 3-4 % of their capital in private equity funds .
but this money is spread thinly around the private equity industry when compared with the amount of money borrowed from banks .
research by investment bank merrill lynch says that banks will lend around £ 100bn for european deals over the next three years .
private equity groups rely on profits from the companies they have bought to pay off such debts .
traditionally , they borrow an average of five times the underlying profits of the company they want to buy .
some industry watchers say the level has now risen to an all-time high average of eight times profits .
walking the tightrope the more money a private equity group borrows , the bigger the target it can bid for , and the greater the potential profits if it can improve its performance .
again , it 's like buying a house .
the people who make money in a property boom are those who push themselves by taking out a bigger mortgage .
if they sell when the market is rising , they make a profit .
if the downturn hits before they have offloaded , the debt repayments can overpower them .
private equity-owned debenhams doubled its profits last year the last time the debt-to-equity ratio was so high was in the late 1980s , when many private equity investments were hit by the eventual economic downturn and rising interest rates .
" it was a tightrope that many people fell off , " says mr cullinan .
he thinks history could be about to repeat itself .
many feel that there are now too many private equity groups chasing potential deals and competing with other companies on the acquisition trail .
" when people have too much money to spend , they start overpaying , " agrees richard sachar , chief executive of private equity advisers almeida capital .
inevitable slowdown there are some indications that it has already started to happen .
in the space of a week last december , two private equity-owned retail chains - off-licence unwins and cd and dvd retailer mvc - called in the administrators .
such stories might suggest that the golden days of private equity will soon be over , but the facts do n't yet support this view .
interest rates are low , stock markets are rising and the total number of private equity receiverships fell in 2005 .
but according to mr cullinan , a readjustment is inevitable .
you ca n't have a period of rapid growth without a slowdown at the end of it , and history repeats itself , he argues .
" the history of private equity is one of exponential growth , followed by a crash , then growth again . "
