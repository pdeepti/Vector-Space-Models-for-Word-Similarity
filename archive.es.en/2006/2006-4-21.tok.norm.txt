while soccer fans prepare for the month-long extravaganza that is the world cup , many of their unenthusiastic partners are considering fleeing the soccer madness and finding companies willing to help them escape . what is a soccer widow to do this summer ?
whether the love of her life is sprawled out on the couch for a month , beer in hand , bellowing something incomprehensible and abusive at the television or whether he is in germany following his team , chances are there are going to be many women who don ’ t share their partner 's enthusiasm for the world cup . while many may see this as a break from the usual relationship merry-go-round in itself , there are alternatives to ferrying in snacks , restocking the fridge or waiting for his team to get knocked out with sympathetic words at the ready .
why not simply take off and leave the world cup behind ? travel and tourism companies have already spotted the potential of the soccer widow market and have started advertising getaway packages and enticing those for whom a month-long soccer tournament is a personal hell . take the swiss tourism board ’ s cheeky ambush marketing campaign which features a selection of hunky men , stretching and flexing while a sexy voice intones : " dear girls , why not escape this summer ’ s world cup to a country where men spend less time on football , and more time on you ? " hunky swiss with more on their minds than soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist these fine young swiss men ?
the 35-second advert , which will begin its run on french , german and swiss television from the start of may , features a farmhand , a cable car conductor , a mountain climber , a ferryman and a couple of brawny lumberjacks before signing off with renzo blumenthal - mr switzerland 2005 and a real-life farmer - milking and then leaning up against a cow while pouting provocatively . the swiss tourism board is hoping that female tourists from switzerland 's neighbors will leave their men on the couch , in the bar , or at the stadium and get away from world cup fever in the alps .
the smoldering ad may even bring in male visitors .
" it is certainly not aimed at gay tourists , but if they like it and come to switzerland because of it , that 's fine , " a campaign spokeswoman said in a statement . the swiss are not the only ones out to cash in . a number of international air carriers such as british airlines and easyjet are offering cut-price tickets and offers during the world cup to destinations other than germany .
travel agents are also seeing the potential in the soccer widow market . specialist travel agents seeing anti-world cup boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but who 's to say that only men like soccer ?
just you , a specialist holiday company for single travelers , has already seen a 15 percent increase in female tourists booking their holidays for the period of the world cup compared to the june-july period in 2005 .
" it appears that a beautiful beach is more appealing than the beautiful game , " said julie chew , the company ’ s customer services manager , in a recent television interview . " many of the women calling our customer service team have mentioned the prospect of a whole month of soccer motivating them to book a holiday , ” she said .
" more and more people are choosing to holiday alone for a variety of reasons ; however , it does seem the world cup is accelerating this trend . " " northern cyprus and mauritius are proving to be popular beach destinations , though our 9-day break to new england and new york is a big draw for shoppers . " whether or not you 're looking to get away from a particular game or for the whole month , there seems to be plenty on offer for those soccer widows willing not to grieve about the loss of their loved one for the duration of the world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for the world cup tourists germany are set to reap the rewards of hosting the 2006 world cup to the tune of an estimated € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- , according to interior minister otto schily , speaking at a tourism conference in berlin on tuesday .

but the last surviving nazi-era church in germany is also a place where pastors preached from pulpits adorned with aryans , and babies were baptised in a font featuring carvings of a nazi storm trooper .
in fact , the national socialist link is clear from the outset .
in the lobby , an iron cross chandelier illuminates the busts of martin luther and field marshall paul von hindenburg , germany 's famous world war i commander .
church officials believe that there was initially a likeness of adolf hitler - after whom the church was supposed to be named .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swastikas have been removed in the main part of the church , stained glass windows framed by a stone arch face pews for 800 worshipers and a giant organ .
the organ was first used at national socialist rallies in nuremberg in 1935 - the year the church was opened and two years after hitler came to power .
the huge stone archway has friezes on its square panels .
images of crosses and other religious symbols are next to those of workers , soldiers , eagles and some blank panels - the swastikas were removed because they are illegal in germany .
the altar features a jesus that could have been a body builder . " everything is about power , strength and victory , " said ilse klein , a historian who works at the church .
“ they are clearly fascist symbols . ” saving their church the church was originally designed in 1928 before the nazis seized power .
it was in continuous use until two years ago , when the stability of the tower was threatened and tiles began falling off .
the parish has been lobbying the government of berlin and the protestant church organizations for the 3.5 million euros they need to rebuild .
but there are hundreds of churches in germany in need of money and the city of berlin is practically broke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis tried to force churches to take on their ideology as a result , the parish leaders hope to get historical designation from the city so that they can then apply for funds set aside for historical landmarks from foundations .
and though they don ’ t plan to use the church again for regular services , they hope to hold special ceremonies , concerts and exhibitions marking anniversaries such as the liberation of auschwitz concentration camp on jan .
27 , 1945 . “ it was the times , ” said klein .
“ but it is not common anymore to see politics illustrated inside of a church so clearly .
that is why we want to save it - to remind people this should never happen again . ”
storm troopers of jesus many nazi-era buildings have been preserved and are still in use today . berlin 's olympic stadium , for example , was designed by hitler ’ s favorite architect , albert speer in 1936 , and the nazi ’ s central bank is now used by the foreign ministry .
but the church presents a trickier problem because it clearly shows that churches collaborated with the nazis more than is commonly acknowledged .
initially , the catholic church cooperated with hitler after pope pius xi signed a treaty with him in 1933 .
but that collapsed in 1937 when hitler began putting catholic clergy on trial after the pontiff issued a statement of concern because of years of nazi interference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tower needs to be structurally stabilized meanwhile , hitler appointed ludwig müller as the reich 's bishop to lead a movement of protestant national socialists called the “ german christians , ” also known as the “ storm troopers of jesus . ”
soon after , hitler tried to force protestant churches to join the reich 's protestant church , which promoted an “ aryan jesus ” and wanted to replace the bible with " mein kampf . "
neither the protestant or the catholic church officially opposed the nazi policies towards jews .
brave clergy as parishioners were increasingly turning towards national socialism , some church officials gave in so that they could keep their churches intact and help others such as members of the confessional church , organized by dissident protestant clergy .
“ they preached inner resistance and said that was better than being jailed , ” said klein .
“ some people were even braver . ”
people such as pastor max kurzreiter of the martin luther memorial church who helped people being persecuted by the nazis . he married the writer jochen klepper and his jewish wife johanna in the church in 1938 - something that was illegal at the time .
klepper , his wife and daughter killed themselves in 1942 rather than face deportation .

a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money . in the past , the german government has focused on women in its attempt to raise the country 's birth rate .
yet german women are having fewer children than ever before .
overall , german women have an average of 1.37 children , compared wiht 1.75 in sweden and 1.74 in the uk . in surveys , many women say that finding the right father , as well as career pressures , keeps motherhood at bay .
the government has been working on ways to make motherhood more attractive to women , for example , by improving the country 's daycare offerings .
but the state is also training its sights on the men , with monetary incentives for fathers to trade their desks for the diaper-changing table .
the law proposed by the coalition government of cdu and spd calls for wage-based parenting subsidies .
starting in 2007 , parents would receive 67 percent of their net incomes , up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,221 -rrb- a month , to stay at home for the first year of their child 's life .

he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .

but the state is also training its sights on the men , with monetary incentives for fathers to trade their desks for the diaper-changing table .
the law proposed by the coalition government of cdu and spd calls for wage-based parenting subsidies .
starting in 2007 , parents would receive 67 percent of their net incomes , up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,221 -rrb- a month , to stay at home for the first year of their child 's life .
a stipulation to the proposal made by family affairs minister ursula von der leyen would require the father to spend at least two of the 12 months at home .
otherwise the last two months of funding would be withheld . paying mr. mom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen thinks fathers should help raise the kids opposition parties and women 's groups - while showing wide acceptance for the income-based scheme - have pointed out that a lack of child care for children under age three in germany may lead to a child-care gap for parents after the 12 months are up .
but von der leyen has received criticism from within her own christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for the " papa proposal . " " it is not the government 's place to tell families how to raise their children , " thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the leipziger zeitung . " what is important is that more children are born , not who is doing the dishes , " said saxony 's premier georg milbradt . but volker baisch , father and president of väter e.v. , an organization in hamburg that advises fathers , disagrees .
he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .
since 1998 , german law has given them that option .
but only 5 percent of the fathers actually end up pushing baby carriages full time .
would more money really help ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's changing father figure in sweden , where the two-month " papa " model proposed by minister von der leyen has been in effect for decades , more than 18 percent of fathers stay home for some length of time .
volker baisch of vater e.v. believes that the new law could mean a 10 percent increase in active fathers .
but money is not the only issue keeping men at work . " men are worried about broaching the topic with their bosses , " baisch said .
" but the fact is that men who spend time at home with their kids are good for business as well . " studies have shown that part-time employees are more effective , less likely to take off sick , and generally more satisfied with their jobs .
their partners are happier too , because they are sharing the work at home . " it is a win-win situation , both for the families and for their employers , " baisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising kids is a family affair sparking a mental change but changing germany 's father figure from full time bread-winner to part-time bread baker is a long road .
volker baisch is afraid that the heated discussion around the two-month paternity leave may have given it a bad rap among business owners - and fathers-to-be - before it has even hit the ground . but the father of two is still convinced that the new legislation will get more dads out to the local playground .
whether that will mean more kids to swing on germany 's swing sets , he says , is anyone 's guess . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

" " the recent statements are a warning sign and should open the eyes of european politicians , " he added . austrian economics minister martin bartenstein said thursday it was high time the eu considered the options . " the message is that the eu would do well to look for alternative pipeline projects , " he said . nonetheless , gazprom and german energy company e.on are continuiung to negotiate the latter 's stake in the yuzhno russkoye gas field in western siberia . politicizing gas supply issues gazprom has risked rekindling tensions that first surfaced in january after the state-run company tightened its taps in a price row with neighboring ukraine , also cutting supplies to some european union countries . bildunterschrift : time to look for new supply routes ?
in a statement on its website , gazprom said it had warned the 25-nation eu not to politicize gas supply issues , threatening to sell fuel elsewhere if its commercial ambitions in the european market were unfairly restricted . " it needs to be noted that attempts to limit gazprom 's activity in the european market and to politicize gas issues , which are in fact solely economic , will not produce good results , " it said . satisfying demand the statement came after gazprom chief alexei miller held what it described as a " frank and objective conversation " in moscow with ambassadors of the 25 eu countries on tuesday , telling them gazprom was " able to satisfy reliably growing gas demand in europe . " " nevertheless , one can not forget that we are actively developing new markets such as north america and china , " he added . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , called on gazprom to stick to its commitments and not to threaten crucial european energy supplies . " the commission expects all suppliers to meet their commercial commitments , " said a commission spokesman .
" in a market that is becoming more and more global , companies are looking for diversification - of suppliers , of routes , " he said , but added : " this diversification should not be used ... to achieve other goals . " changes to law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , the energy question is topping political agendas miller 's meeting with the eu envoys came after the financial times reported unease in britain over news the government there had considered changing the law in order to block a potential takeover by gazprom of british gas supplier centrica . the gazprom statement was a clear warning that europe , which itself has cautioned russia against using its vast energy resources as a " political weapon , " was not the company 's only customer and that it would not react kindly to being blocked from competing in europe 's energy market . " we just want european countries to understand that we have other alternatives in terms of gas sales , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov told the ft .
" if the european union wants our gas , it has to consider our interests as well . " a gazprom source told afp that the company was concerned about discussion in brussels and other eu capitals about the possibility of applying eu anti-monopoly legislation to gazprom to loosen its control over the sprawling gas pipeline network in russia and other parts of the ex-soviet union . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oil and energy top g8 meeting in moscow finance ministers of the group of eight economically-powerful countries gather in moscow friday for two days of talks likely to focus on russia 's swelling clout in world oil and gas markets .

" that night , no one fled , " said mykola bondarenko , who was a 29-year-old engineer at the time .
" we all knew the risks , but we all stayed . " the two men were in the front lines of " liquidators " - some 600,000 soldiers , firemen and civilians who were deployed over the next four years to clean up after the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial honors the first to try to contain the disaster " remember that bluish glow , it was so beautiful , " bertov murmured . " and the flash , " bondarenko added .
" just like in a camera .
what a dose we must have had ! " cars and housing promised the first to clean up after disaster as members of " liquidators of the first group , " the ones most severely affected , bertov was promised lifetime medical care and handsome financial compensation , even a car - an extravagance ordinary soviet citizens usually had to wait for several years for , in the unlikely event they could scrape together enough money for the purchase . " back then , we were still considered heroes , " he said . bertov did receive a zaporozhets sedan and 2,500 rubles , the equivalent of an average yearly salary , as well as housing in a new neighborhood on kiev 's outskirts where " liquidators " and other chernobyl victims were provided accommodation . but that is where the compensation ended . health care left to former soviet states five years after the accident , the prospects of receiving any more became dim with the breakup of the soviet union . in place of a single superpower with central planning , victims of the accident were now dependent for their care on three separate governments whose economies were in shambles - belarus , russia and ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,000 people still work at the chernobyl power plant today bertov is living through what he calls his " second chernobyl " - trying to get the some 12,000 dollars -lrb- 9,724 euros -rrb- in unpaid pension payments the state owes him , a small fortune equivalent to nearly six average annual salaries in today 's ukraine . " my friends are dying , one after another , " he said .
" the last one left us two weeks ago .
i do n't know if i 'll have the strength to keep fighting . " like most " liquidators , " bertov has faced both physical and psychological illness over the past two decades . his medical chart has included everything from irradiation to heart disease , bronchitis , gastritis , extreme fatigue , difficulties with focusing .
specialists say all are consequences of the accident . public indifference for a " lost generation " " they are a lost generation , " said galina rumyantseva , of the serbsky psychiatric institute in moscow , who has closely worked with the chernobyl clean-up workers . among the most difficult issues faced by men like bertov and bondarenko is the indifference that the authorities and the population at large in ukraine show today to people who faced the nuclear power plant 's bluish glow . " it 's difficult to battle both sickness and oblivion , " bertov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the public have forgotten the people affected by radiation today bertov and bondarenko live in the same part of the troeshchina district on kiev 's outskirts that was built for " liquidators " and other victims of the chernobyl disaster . nearby is a cemetery , where the residents are usually buried .
it is steadily filling up . on the 20th anniversary of the accident , the two men will walk over to the cemetery to pay respects to their friends buried there , knowing that they too will rest there . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .

but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job . violetta and jan gros live in a remote village in swietokrzyskie province , some 200 kilometers south of the polish capital .
there 's little work to be found in this largely untouched corner of the earth , and come spring , the two farm workers pack their bags and head to germany to join some 300,000 other poles in the country for the annual asparagus harvest . " the region we live in is a very poor , rural area , " explained violetta .
" there are no businesses or factories here , and anyone who can speak a smattering of german ups it and leaves .
there 's practically nothing to do here . " no option the couple are both in their mid-forties and have been unemployed for years .
the polish state provides little in the way of support , and it 's up to them to make ends meet . " i 'm actually a butcher and i worked for the same company for several years , " said jan .
" but then it went bankrupt .
my wife and i own three hectares of land but it 's not enough to live off .
i used to go to work and she took care of the farm , but as soon as i lost my job , times got tough . " in such tight circumstances , jan soon realized his only option was to leave the country . " my cousin had a friend in munich who helped me get work picking asparagus , " he explained .
" for the first three years i went by myself , then i started to take my wife with me . " leaving the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual aspargus harvest attracts thousands of poles every year jan and violetta earn 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.17 -rrb- an hour picking asparagus in bavaria during the two-month season .
they 've never had problems getting paid on time , but despite taking home good money , they 're well aware there must be easier ways of feeding a family of five . " the early days were the hardest , " said violetta .
" having to leave home to go to work in a foreign country with foreign people was very painful .
we did n't speak a word of german .
it was unbearable .
but i 'm adaptable and i learn fast .
and i knew my children would be well looked after with my parents . " three generations of the gros family share the small house in swietokrzyskie .
but the grandparents are getting older , and can no longer be relied upon to help out . " my mother has always been very supportive , but she 's increasingly unwell , " said violetta .
" when she 's not up to the work on the farm then the neighbor gives her a hand , and when we come back then we help him .
everyone helps each other . " upping the ante but this year , jan and violetta might find themselves stuck at home .
their yearly trip over the border with some thirty other locals currently hangs in the balance due to a new german law which rules that only 80 to 90 percent of last year 's foreign seasonal workers can be hired this year , with unemployed germans picking up the slack . the government 's plans , coupled with a new eu directive that requires seasonal workers to pay higher contributions into poland 's social insurance schemes , have left workers in poland who rely on the annual asparagus harvest concerned they 're about to lose out on this vital source of income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles ' jobs are now in the balance " you have to buy food in germany for the two months that you 're there and the cost of living is very high there , " explained violetta .
" many of our friends wo n't be going , because it 's no longer worth it .
but we hope that we 'll still be able to make a profit and after all , we do n't have anything to lose . " but ultimately , the couple are confident there 's still room for them in germany 's asparagus fields . " it 's been tried before , " pointed out jan .

" that night , no one fled , " said mykola bondarenko , who was a 29-year-old engineer at the time .
" we all knew the risks , but we all stayed . " the two men were in the front lines of " liquidators " - some 600,000 soldiers , firemen and civilians who were deployed over the next four years to clean up after the disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial honors the first to try to contain the disaster " remember that bluish glow , it was so beautiful , " bertov murmured . " and the flash , " bondarenko added .
" just like in a camera .
what a dose we must have had ! " cars and housing promised the first to clean up after disaster as members of " liquidators of the first group , " the ones most severely affected , bertov was promised lifetime medical care and handsome financial compensation , even a car - an extravagance ordinary soviet citizens usually had to wait for several years for , in the unlikely event they could scrape together enough money for the purchase . " back then , we were still considered heroes , " he said . bertov did receive a zaporozhets sedan and 2,500 rubles , the equivalent of an average yearly salary , as well as housing in a new neighborhood on kiev 's outskirts where " liquidators " and other chernobyl victims were provided accommodation . but that is where the compensation ended . health care left to former soviet states five years after the accident , the prospects of receiving any more became dim with the breakup of the soviet union . in place of a single superpower with central planning , victims of the accident were now dependent for their care on three separate governments whose economies were in shambles - belarus , russia and ukraine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1,000 people still work at the chernobyl power plant today bertov is living through what he calls his " second chernobyl " - trying to get the some 12,000 dollars -lrb- 9,724 euros -rrb- in unpaid pension payments the state owes him , a small fortune equivalent to nearly six average annual salaries in today 's ukraine . " my friends are dying , one after another , " he said .
" the last one left us two weeks ago .
i do n't know if i 'll have the strength to keep fighting . " like most " liquidators , " bertov has faced both physical and psychological illness over the past two decades . his medical chart has included everything from irradiation to heart disease , bronchitis , gastritis , extreme fatigue , difficulties with focusing .
specialists say all are consequences of the accident . public indifference for a " lost generation " " they are a lost generation , " said galina rumyantseva , of the serbsky psychiatric institute in moscow , who has closely worked with the chernobyl clean-up workers . among the most difficult issues faced by men like bertov and bondarenko is the indifference that the authorities and the population at large in ukraine show today to people who faced the nuclear power plant 's bluish glow . " it 's difficult to battle both sickness and oblivion , " bertov said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in the public have forgotten the people affected by radiation today bertov and bondarenko live in the same part of the troeshchina district on kiev 's outskirts that was built for " liquidators " and other victims of the chernobyl disaster . nearby is a cemetery , where the residents are usually buried .
it is steadily filling up . on the 20th anniversary of the accident , the two men will walk over to the cemetery to pay respects to their friends buried there , knowing that they too will rest there . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greenpeace questions official chernobyl casualty figures in a report released tuesday , environmental organization greenpeace said the consequences of the chernobyl reactor disaster are being played down .
the number of victims will far surpass official figures , it said .
-lrb- april 18 , 2006 -rrb- nuclear energy causes heated debate in europe nuclear power has the reputation of being inexpensive and safe .
but critics point out that this energy form has many disadvantages , too .
the environmental implications also need to be considered .
-lrb- april 6 , 2006 -rrb- " every type of reactor poses a threat " the remaining soviet-era chernobyl-type nuclear reactors are especially dangerous but are n't the only risk when it comes to atomic power plants , helmut hirsch , physicist and consultant on nuclear safety told dw-world.de.
-lrb- april 20 , 2006 -rrb- feedback should the liquidators ' health be left in the hand of the former soviet states or should other nations also support them ?

while soccer fans prepare for the month-long extravaganza that is the world cup , many of their unenthusiastic partners are considering fleeing the soccer madness and finding companies willing to help them escape . what is a soccer widow to do this summer ?
whether the love of her life is sprawled out on the couch for a month , beer in hand , bellowing something incomprehensible and abusive at the television or whether he is in germany following his team , chances are there are going to be many women who don ’ t share their partner 's enthusiasm for the world cup . while many may see this as a break from the usual relationship merry-go-round in itself , there are alternatives to ferrying in snacks , restocking the fridge or waiting for his team to get knocked out with sympathetic words at the ready .
why not simply take off and leave the world cup behind ? travel and tourism companies have already spotted the potential of the soccer widow market and have started advertising getaway packages and enticing those for whom a month-long soccer tournament is a personal hell . take the swiss tourism board ’ s cheeky ambush marketing campaign which features a selection of hunky men , stretching and flexing while a sexy voice intones : " dear girls , why not escape this summer ’ s world cup to a country where men spend less time on football , and more time on you ? " hunky swiss with more on their minds than soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist these fine young swiss men ?
the 35-second advert , which will begin its run on french , german and swiss television from the start of may , features a farmhand , a cable car conductor , a mountain climber , a ferryman and a couple of brawny lumberjacks before signing off with renzo blumenthal - mr switzerland 2005 and a real-life farmer - milking and then leaning up against a cow while pouting provocatively . the swiss tourism board is hoping that female tourists from switzerland 's neighbors will leave their men on the couch , in the bar , or at the stadium and get away from world cup fever in the alps .
the smoldering ad may even bring in male visitors .
" it is certainly not aimed at gay tourists , but if they like it and come to switzerland because of it , that 's fine , " a campaign spokeswoman said in a statement . the swiss are not the only ones out to cash in . a number of international air carriers such as british airlines and easyjet are offering cut-price tickets and offers during the world cup to destinations other than germany .
travel agents are also seeing the potential in the soccer widow market . specialist travel agents seeing anti-world cup boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but who 's to say that only men like soccer ?
just you , a specialist holiday company for single travelers , has already seen a 15 percent increase in female tourists booking their holidays for the period of the world cup compared to the june-july period in 2005 .
" it appears that a beautiful beach is more appealing than the beautiful game , " said julie chew , the company ’ s customer services manager , in a recent television interview . " many of the women calling our customer service team have mentioned the prospect of a whole month of soccer motivating them to book a holiday , ” she said .
" more and more people are choosing to holiday alone for a variety of reasons ; however , it does seem the world cup is accelerating this trend . " " northern cyprus and mauritius are proving to be popular beach destinations , though our 9-day break to new england and new york is a big draw for shoppers . " whether or not you 're looking to get away from a particular game or for the whole month , there seems to be plenty on offer for those soccer widows willing not to grieve about the loss of their loved one for the duration of the world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for the world cup tourists germany are set to reap the rewards of hosting the 2006 world cup to the tune of an estimated € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- , according to interior minister otto schily , speaking at a tourism conference in berlin on tuesday .

while soccer fans prepare for the month-long extravaganza that is the world cup , many of their unenthusiastic partners are considering fleeing the soccer madness and finding companies willing to help them escape . what is a soccer widow to do this summer ?
whether the love of her life is sprawled out on the couch for a month , beer in hand , bellowing something incomprehensible and abusive at the television or whether he is in germany following his team , chances are there are going to be many women who don ’ t share their partner 's enthusiasm for the world cup . while many may see this as a break from the usual relationship merry-go-round in itself , there are alternatives to ferrying in snacks , restocking the fridge or waiting for his team to get knocked out with sympathetic words at the ready .
why not simply take off and leave the world cup behind ? travel and tourism companies have already spotted the potential of the soccer widow market and have started advertising getaway packages and enticing those for whom a month-long soccer tournament is a personal hell . take the swiss tourism board ’ s cheeky ambush marketing campaign which features a selection of hunky men , stretching and flexing while a sexy voice intones : " dear girls , why not escape this summer ’ s world cup to a country where men spend less time on football , and more time on you ? " hunky swiss with more on their minds than soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist these fine young swiss men ?
the 35-second advert , which will begin its run on french , german and swiss television from the start of may , features a farmhand , a cable car conductor , a mountain climber , a ferryman and a couple of brawny lumberjacks before signing off with renzo blumenthal - mr switzerland 2005 and a real-life farmer - milking and then leaning up against a cow while pouting provocatively . the swiss tourism board is hoping that female tourists from switzerland 's neighbors will leave their men on the couch , in the bar , or at the stadium and get away from world cup fever in the alps .
the smoldering ad may even bring in male visitors .

one such victim was the german citizen khaled al-masri , who was flown to afghanistan and held for several months as a terrorist suspect by the united states . the european union 's anti-terrorism co-ordinator says that there is no proof yet that the cia organised secret flights and ran detention centers for terror suspects .

a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money . in the past , the german government has focused on women in its attempt to raise the country 's birth rate .
yet german women are having fewer children than ever before .
overall , german women have an average of 1.37 children , compared wiht 1.75 in sweden and 1.74 in the uk . in surveys , many women say that finding the right father , as well as career pressures , keeps motherhood at bay .
the government has been working on ways to make motherhood more attractive to women , for example , by improving the country 's daycare offerings .
but the state is also training its sights on the men , with monetary incentives for fathers to trade their desks for the diaper-changing table .
the law proposed by the coalition government of cdu and spd calls for wage-based parenting subsidies .
starting in 2007 , parents would receive 67 percent of their net incomes , up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,221 -rrb- a month , to stay at home for the first year of their child 's life .
a stipulation to the proposal made by family affairs minister ursula von der leyen would require the father to spend at least two of the 12 months at home .
otherwise the last two months of funding would be withheld . paying mr. mom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen thinks fathers should help raise the kids opposition parties and women 's groups - while showing wide acceptance for the income-based scheme - have pointed out that a lack of child care for children under age three in germany may lead to a child-care gap for parents after the 12 months are up .
but von der leyen has received criticism from within her own christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for the " papa proposal . " " it is not the government 's place to tell families how to raise their children , " thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the leipziger zeitung . " what is important is that more children are born , not who is doing the dishes , " said saxony 's premier georg milbradt . but volker baisch , father and president of väter e.v. , an organization in hamburg that advises fathers , disagrees .
he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .
since 1998 , german law has given them that option .
but only 5 percent of the fathers actually end up pushing baby carriages full time .
would more money really help ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's changing father figure in sweden , where the two-month " papa " model proposed by minister von der leyen has been in effect for decades , more than 18 percent of fathers stay home for some length of time .
volker baisch of vater e.v. believes that the new law could mean a 10 percent increase in active fathers .
but money is not the only issue keeping men at work . " men are worried about broaching the topic with their bosses , " baisch said .
" but the fact is that men who spend time at home with their kids are good for business as well . " studies have shown that part-time employees are more effective , less likely to take off sick , and generally more satisfied with their jobs .
their partners are happier too , because they are sharing the work at home . " it is a win-win situation , both for the families and for their employers , " baisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising kids is a family affair sparking a mental change but changing germany 's father figure from full time bread-winner to part-time bread baker is a long road .
volker baisch is afraid that the heated discussion around the two-month paternity leave may have given it a bad rap among business owners - and fathers-to-be - before it has even hit the ground . but the father of two is still convinced that the new legislation will get more dads out to the local playground .

a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money . in the past , the german government has focused on women in its attempt to raise the country 's birth rate .
yet german women are having fewer children than ever before .
overall , german women have an average of 1.37 children , compared wiht 1.75 in sweden and 1.74 in the uk . in surveys , many women say that finding the right father , as well as career pressures , keeps motherhood at bay .
the government has been working on ways to make motherhood more attractive to women , for example , by improving the country 's daycare offerings .
but the state is also training its sights on the men , with monetary incentives for fathers to trade their desks for the diaper-changing table .
the law proposed by the coalition government of cdu and spd calls for wage-based parenting subsidies .
starting in 2007 , parents would receive 67 percent of their net incomes , up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,221 -rrb- a month , to stay at home for the first year of their child 's life .
a stipulation to the proposal made by family affairs minister ursula von der leyen would require the father to spend at least two of the 12 months at home .

but von der leyen has received criticism from within her own christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for the " papa proposal . " " it is not the government 's place to tell families how to raise their children , " thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the leipziger zeitung . " what is important is that more children are born , not who is doing the dishes , " said saxony 's premier georg milbradt . but volker baisch , father and president of väter e.v. , an organization in hamburg that advises fathers , disagrees .
he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .
since 1998 , german law has given them that option .
but only 5 percent of the fathers actually end up pushing baby carriages full time .

" " the recent statements are a warning sign and should open the eyes of european politicians , " he added . austrian economics minister martin bartenstein said thursday it was high time the eu considered the options .

in a statement on its website , gazprom said it had warned the 25-nation eu not to politicize gas supply issues , threatening to sell fuel elsewhere if its commercial ambitions in the european market were unfairly restricted . " it needs to be noted that attempts to limit gazprom 's activity in the european market and to politicize gas issues , which are in fact solely economic , will not produce good results , " it said . satisfying demand the statement came after gazprom chief alexei miller held what it described as a " frank and objective conversation " in moscow with ambassadors of the 25 eu countries on tuesday , telling them gazprom was " able to satisfy reliably growing gas demand in europe .

" we just want european countries to understand that we have other alternatives in terms of gas sales , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov told the ft .
" if the european union wants our gas , it has to consider our interests as well . " a gazprom source told afp that the company was concerned about discussion in brussels and other eu capitals about the possibility of applying eu anti-monopoly legislation to gazprom to loosen its control over the sprawling gas pipeline network in russia and other parts of the ex-soviet union . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oil and energy top g8 meeting in moscow finance ministers of the group of eight economically-powerful countries gather in moscow friday for two days of talks likely to focus on russia 's swelling clout in world oil and gas markets .

but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job . violetta and jan gros live in a remote village in swietokrzyskie province , some 200 kilometers south of the polish capital .
there 's little work to be found in this largely untouched corner of the earth , and come spring , the two farm workers pack their bags and head to germany to join some 300,000 other poles in the country for the annual asparagus harvest . " the region we live in is a very poor , rural area , " explained violetta .
" there are no businesses or factories here , and anyone who can speak a smattering of german ups it and leaves .
there 's practically nothing to do here . " no option the couple are both in their mid-forties and have been unemployed for years .
the polish state provides little in the way of support , and it 's up to them to make ends meet . " i 'm actually a butcher and i worked for the same company for several years , " said jan .
" but then it went bankrupt .

they 've never had problems getting paid on time , but despite taking home good money , they 're well aware there must be easier ways of feeding a family of five . " the early days were the hardest , " said violetta .
" having to leave home to go to work in a foreign country with foreign people was very painful .
we did n't speak a word of german .
it was unbearable .
but i 'm adaptable and i learn fast .

everyone helps each other . " upping the ante but this year , jan and violetta might find themselves stuck at home .
their yearly trip over the border with some thirty other locals currently hangs in the balance due to a new german law which rules that only 80 to 90 percent of last year 's foreign seasonal workers can be hired this year , with unemployed germans picking up the slack . the government 's plans , coupled with a new eu directive that requires seasonal workers to pay higher contributions into poland 's social insurance schemes , have left workers in poland who rely on the annual asparagus harvest concerned they 're about to lose out on this vital source of income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles ' jobs are now in the balance " you have to buy food in germany for the two months that you 're there and the cost of living is very high there , " explained violetta .

but we hope that we 'll still be able to make a profit and after all , we do n't have anything to lose . " but ultimately , the couple are confident there 's still room for them in germany 's asparagus fields . " it 's been tried before , " pointed out jan .

but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job . violetta and jan gros live in a remote village in swietokrzyskie province , some 200 kilometers south of the polish capital .
there 's little work to be found in this largely untouched corner of the earth , and come spring , the two farm workers pack their bags and head to germany to join some 300,000 other poles in the country for the annual asparagus harvest . " the region we live in is a very poor , rural area , " explained violetta .
" there are no businesses or factories here , and anyone who can speak a smattering of german ups it and leaves .
there 's practically nothing to do here . " no option the couple are both in their mid-forties and have been unemployed for years .
the polish state provides little in the way of support , and it 's up to them to make ends meet . " i 'm actually a butcher and i worked for the same company for several years , " said jan .
" but then it went bankrupt .
my wife and i own three hectares of land but it 's not enough to live off .
i used to go to work and she took care of the farm , but as soon as i lost my job , times got tough . " in such tight circumstances , jan soon realized his only option was to leave the country . " my cousin had a friend in munich who helped me get work picking asparagus , " he explained .
" for the first three years i went by myself , then i started to take my wife with me . " leaving the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual aspargus harvest attracts thousands of poles every year jan and violetta earn 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.17 -rrb- an hour picking asparagus in bavaria during the two-month season .
they 've never had problems getting paid on time , but despite taking home good money , they 're well aware there must be easier ways of feeding a family of five . " the early days were the hardest , " said violetta .
" having to leave home to go to work in a foreign country with foreign people was very painful .
we did n't speak a word of german .
it was unbearable .
but i 'm adaptable and i learn fast .
and i knew my children would be well looked after with my parents . " three generations of the gros family share the small house in swietokrzyskie .
but the grandparents are getting older , and can no longer be relied upon to help out . " my mother has always been very supportive , but she 's increasingly unwell , " said violetta .
" when she 's not up to the work on the farm then the neighbor gives her a hand , and when we come back then we help him .
everyone helps each other . " upping the ante but this year , jan and violetta might find themselves stuck at home .
their yearly trip over the border with some thirty other locals currently hangs in the balance due to a new german law which rules that only 80 to 90 percent of last year 's foreign seasonal workers can be hired this year , with unemployed germans picking up the slack . the government 's plans , coupled with a new eu directive that requires seasonal workers to pay higher contributions into poland 's social insurance schemes , have left workers in poland who rely on the annual asparagus harvest concerned they 're about to lose out on this vital source of income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles ' jobs are now in the balance " you have to buy food in germany for the two months that you 're there and the cost of living is very high there , " explained violetta .
" many of our friends wo n't be going , because it 's no longer worth it .
but we hope that we 'll still be able to make a profit and after all , we do n't have anything to lose . " but ultimately , the couple are confident there 's still room for them in germany 's asparagus fields . " it 's been tried before , " pointed out jan .
" the job agency sends along some kids and they only ever last a few hours .

"
as the sun comes out and germany 's multitude of beer gardens begin opening for the spring and summer season , the society against dishonest pouring is out making sure that punters are n't being short-changed at the tap . there is only one way millions of germans get true summer refreshment , and it comes in the form of a freshly tapped glass of beer . and just as every king needs the perfect crown , germans know every beer requires a perfect frothy head on top .
but they 're still stingy about trading too much potential beer space for the sudsy spray , and have clearly marked every glass with a line to make sure they 're getting their euros ' worth of golden liquid . alas , when patrons start tipping back their fourth , fifth or sixth glass , some bar proprietors try to take them for a ride .
but that 's when the society against dishonest pouring steps in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheers to full beers !
" badly poured beers are among the largest problems in beer gardens , restaurants and at the oktoberfest , " the society wrote on its web site . the sadp estimates that being poured a finger 's width less of lager costs patrons 4.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- worth of beer at munich 's annual oktoberfest alone . how to perform the index finger text in case further proof of how seriously germans take their beer - remember , there is a near-holy law dictating exactly what can go into a bottle of brew - the sadp started putting beer pouring technique under the microscope back in 1899 . the society 's web site even offers tips on how to judge whether a beer is poorly poured : after the server brings your drink , wait a moment for the head and beer to settle .

while soccer fans prepare for the month-long extravaganza that is the world cup , many of their unenthusiastic partners are considering fleeing the soccer madness and finding companies willing to help them escape . what is a soccer widow to do this summer ?
whether the love of her life is sprawled out on the couch for a month , beer in hand , bellowing something incomprehensible and abusive at the television or whether he is in germany following his team , chances are there are going to be many women who don ’ t share their partner 's enthusiasm for the world cup . while many may see this as a break from the usual relationship merry-go-round in itself , there are alternatives to ferrying in snacks , restocking the fridge or waiting for his team to get knocked out with sympathetic words at the ready .
why not simply take off and leave the world cup behind ? travel and tourism companies have already spotted the potential of the soccer widow market and have started advertising getaway packages and enticing those for whom a month-long soccer tournament is a personal hell . take the swiss tourism board ’ s cheeky ambush marketing campaign which features a selection of hunky men , stretching and flexing while a sexy voice intones : " dear girls , why not escape this summer ’ s world cup to a country where men spend less time on football , and more time on you ? " hunky swiss with more on their minds than soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist these fine young swiss men ?
the 35-second advert , which will begin its run on french , german and swiss television from the start of may , features a farmhand , a cable car conductor , a mountain climber , a ferryman and a couple of brawny lumberjacks before signing off with renzo blumenthal - mr switzerland 2005 and a real-life farmer - milking and then leaning up against a cow while pouting provocatively . the swiss tourism board is hoping that female tourists from switzerland 's neighbors will leave their men on the couch , in the bar , or at the stadium and get away from world cup fever in the alps .
the smoldering ad may even bring in male visitors .
" it is certainly not aimed at gay tourists , but if they like it and come to switzerland because of it , that 's fine , " a campaign spokeswoman said in a statement . the swiss are not the only ones out to cash in . a number of international air carriers such as british airlines and easyjet are offering cut-price tickets and offers during the world cup to destinations other than germany .
travel agents are also seeing the potential in the soccer widow market . specialist travel agents seeing anti-world cup boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but who 's to say that only men like soccer ?
just you , a specialist holiday company for single travelers , has already seen a 15 percent increase in female tourists booking their holidays for the period of the world cup compared to the june-july period in 2005 .
" it appears that a beautiful beach is more appealing than the beautiful game , " said julie chew , the company ’ s customer services manager , in a recent television interview . " many of the women calling our customer service team have mentioned the prospect of a whole month of soccer motivating them to book a holiday , ” she said .
" more and more people are choosing to holiday alone for a variety of reasons ; however , it does seem the world cup is accelerating this trend .

one such victim was the german citizen khaled al-masri , who was flown to afghanistan and held for several months as a terrorist suspect by the united states . the european union 's anti-terrorism co-ordinator says that there is no proof yet that the cia organised secret flights and ran detention centers for terror suspects .

a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money . in the past , the german government has focused on women in its attempt to raise the country 's birth rate .
yet german women are having fewer children than ever before .
overall , german women have an average of 1.37 children , compared wiht 1.75 in sweden and 1.74 in the uk . in surveys , many women say that finding the right father , as well as career pressures , keeps motherhood at bay .
the government has been working on ways to make motherhood more attractive to women , for example , by improving the country 's daycare offerings .
but the state is also training its sights on the men , with monetary incentives for fathers to trade their desks for the diaper-changing table .
the law proposed by the coalition government of cdu and spd calls for wage-based parenting subsidies .
starting in 2007 , parents would receive 67 percent of their net incomes , up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,221 -rrb- a month , to stay at home for the first year of their child 's life .
a stipulation to the proposal made by family affairs minister ursula von der leyen would require the father to spend at least two of the 12 months at home .
otherwise the last two months of funding would be withheld . paying mr. mom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen thinks fathers should help raise the kids opposition parties and women 's groups - while showing wide acceptance for the income-based scheme - have pointed out that a lack of child care for children under age three in germany may lead to a child-care gap for parents after the 12 months are up .
but von der leyen has received criticism from within her own christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for the " papa proposal . " " it is not the government 's place to tell families how to raise their children , " thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the leipziger zeitung . " what is important is that more children are born , not who is doing the dishes , " said saxony 's premier georg milbradt . but volker baisch , father and president of väter e.v. , an organization in hamburg that advises fathers , disagrees .
he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .
since 1998 , german law has given them that option .
but only 5 percent of the fathers actually end up pushing baby carriages full time .
would more money really help ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's changing father figure in sweden , where the two-month " papa " model proposed by minister von der leyen has been in effect for decades , more than 18 percent of fathers stay home for some length of time .
volker baisch of vater e.v. believes that the new law could mean a 10 percent increase in active fathers .
but money is not the only issue keeping men at work . " men are worried about broaching the topic with their bosses , " baisch said .
" but the fact is that men who spend time at home with their kids are good for business as well . " studies have shown that part-time employees are more effective , less likely to take off sick , and generally more satisfied with their jobs .
their partners are happier too , because they are sharing the work at home . " it is a win-win situation , both for the families and for their employers , " baisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising kids is a family affair sparking a mental change but changing germany 's father figure from full time bread-winner to part-time bread baker is a long road .
volker baisch is afraid that the heated discussion around the two-month paternity leave may have given it a bad rap among business owners - and fathers-to-be - before it has even hit the ground . but the father of two is still convinced that the new legislation will get more dads out to the local playground .
whether that will mean more kids to swing on germany 's swing sets , he says , is anyone 's guess . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

as the sun comes out and germany 's multitude of beer gardens begin opening for the spring and summer season , the society against dishonest pouring is out making sure that punters are n't being short-changed at the tap . there is only one way millions of germans get true summer refreshment , and it comes in the form of a freshly tapped glass of beer . and just as every king needs the perfect crown , germans know every beer requires a perfect frothy head on top .
but they 're still stingy about trading too much potential beer space for the sudsy spray , and have clearly marked every glass with a line to make sure they 're getting their euros ' worth of golden liquid . alas , when patrons start tipping back their fourth , fifth or sixth glass , some bar proprietors try to take them for a ride .

now perform the index finger test .
put your index finder on the standard mark ; if the beer does not begin directly below your finder , the beer has been poured badly .
the society confirmed its raison d 'etre at a munich beer festival last month where none of the 20 steins it tested contained a full liter -lrb- about 34 fluid ounces -rrb- of beer . those looking to join the illustrious group of beer detectives can download registration forms or show up at the regular meetings on the first and third tuesday of the month in munich 's famed hofbraühaus . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drink more to smoke less a german company - in an ultimate act of retro defiance - has announced its plans to produce nicotine-laced beer .

a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money . in the past , the german government has focused on women in its attempt to raise the country 's birth rate .
yet german women are having fewer children than ever before .
overall , german women have an average of 1.37 children , compared wiht 1.75 in sweden and 1.74 in the uk . in surveys , many women say that finding the right father , as well as career pressures , keeps motherhood at bay .
the government has been working on ways to make motherhood more attractive to women , for example , by improving the country 's daycare offerings .
but the state is also training its sights on the men , with monetary incentives for fathers to trade their desks for the diaper-changing table .
the law proposed by the coalition government of cdu and spd calls for wage-based parenting subsidies .
starting in 2007 , parents would receive 67 percent of their net incomes , up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,221 -rrb- a month , to stay at home for the first year of their child 's life .
a stipulation to the proposal made by family affairs minister ursula von der leyen would require the father to spend at least two of the 12 months at home .
otherwise the last two months of funding would be withheld . paying mr. mom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen thinks fathers should help raise the kids opposition parties and women 's groups - while showing wide acceptance for the income-based scheme - have pointed out that a lack of child care for children under age three in germany may lead to a child-care gap for parents after the 12 months are up .
but von der leyen has received criticism from within her own christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for the " papa proposal . " " it is not the government 's place to tell families how to raise their children , " thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the leipziger zeitung . " what is important is that more children are born , not who is doing the dishes , " said saxony 's premier georg milbradt . but volker baisch , father and president of väter e.v. , an organization in hamburg that advises fathers , disagrees .
he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .
since 1998 , german law has given them that option .
but only 5 percent of the fathers actually end up pushing baby carriages full time .
would more money really help ?

volker baisch of vater e.v. believes that the new law could mean a 10 percent increase in active fathers .
but money is not the only issue keeping men at work . " men are worried about broaching the topic with their bosses , " baisch said .
" but the fact is that men who spend time at home with their kids are good for business as well . " studies have shown that part-time employees are more effective , less likely to take off sick , and generally more satisfied with their jobs .
their partners are happier too , because they are sharing the work at home .

the german government is now stepping up its efforts to make german more prominent in the eu . the german government is turning up the heat on the european union to ensure all official texts are also published in the german language , officials said on thursday . " germany has a right to have these documents in german , " the deputy foreign minister responsible for europe , günter gloser , told german news agency dpa . the german parliament and the french national assembly issued a statement earlier this month denouncing an " unacceptable drift toward a monolingual system " dominated by english .

" " the recent statements are a warning sign and should open the eyes of european politicians , " he added . austrian economics minister martin bartenstein said thursday it was high time the eu considered the options . " the message is that the eu would do well to look for alternative pipeline projects , " he said . nonetheless , gazprom and german energy company e.on are continuiung to negotiate the latter 's stake in the yuzhno russkoye gas field in western siberia . politicizing gas supply issues gazprom has risked rekindling tensions that first surfaced in january after the state-run company tightened its taps in a price row with neighboring ukraine , also cutting supplies to some european union countries . bildunterschrift : time to look for new supply routes ?
in a statement on its website , gazprom said it had warned the 25-nation eu not to politicize gas supply issues , threatening to sell fuel elsewhere if its commercial ambitions in the european market were unfairly restricted . " it needs to be noted that attempts to limit gazprom 's activity in the european market and to politicize gas issues , which are in fact solely economic , will not produce good results , " it said . satisfying demand the statement came after gazprom chief alexei miller held what it described as a " frank and objective conversation " in moscow with ambassadors of the 25 eu countries on tuesday , telling them gazprom was " able to satisfy reliably growing gas demand in europe .

" it needs to be noted that attempts to limit gazprom 's activity in the european market and to politicize gas issues , which are in fact solely economic , will not produce good results , " it said . satisfying demand the statement came after gazprom chief alexei miller held what it described as a " frank and objective conversation " in moscow with ambassadors of the 25 eu countries on tuesday , telling them gazprom was " able to satisfy reliably growing gas demand in europe . " " nevertheless , one can not forget that we are actively developing new markets such as north america and china , " he added . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , called on gazprom to stick to its commitments and not to threaten crucial european energy supplies . " the commission expects all suppliers to meet their commercial commitments , " said a commission spokesman .
" in a market that is becoming more and more global , companies are looking for diversification - of suppliers , of routes , " he said , but added : " this diversification should not be used ... to achieve other goals . " changes to law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , the energy question is topping political agendas miller 's meeting with the eu envoys came after the financial times reported unease in britain over news the government there had considered changing the law in order to block a potential takeover by gazprom of british gas supplier centrica . the gazprom statement was a clear warning that europe , which itself has cautioned russia against using its vast energy resources as a " political weapon , " was not the company 's only customer and that it would not react kindly to being blocked from competing in europe 's energy market . " we just want european countries to understand that we have other alternatives in terms of gas sales , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov told the ft .
" if the european union wants our gas , it has to consider our interests as well . " a gazprom source told afp that the company was concerned about discussion in brussels and other eu capitals about the possibility of applying eu anti-monopoly legislation to gazprom to loosen its control over the sprawling gas pipeline network in russia and other parts of the ex-soviet union . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oil and energy top g8 meeting in moscow finance ministers of the group of eight economically-powerful countries gather in moscow friday for two days of talks likely to focus on russia 's swelling clout in world oil and gas markets .

but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job . violetta and jan gros live in a remote village in swietokrzyskie province , some 200 kilometers south of the polish capital .
there 's little work to be found in this largely untouched corner of the earth , and come spring , the two farm workers pack their bags and head to germany to join some 300,000 other poles in the country for the annual asparagus harvest . " the region we live in is a very poor , rural area , " explained violetta .
" there are no businesses or factories here , and anyone who can speak a smattering of german ups it and leaves .
there 's practically nothing to do here . " no option the couple are both in their mid-forties and have been unemployed for years .
the polish state provides little in the way of support , and it 's up to them to make ends meet . " i 'm actually a butcher and i worked for the same company for several years , " said jan .
" but then it went bankrupt .
my wife and i own three hectares of land but it 's not enough to live off .
i used to go to work and she took care of the farm , but as soon as i lost my job , times got tough . " in such tight circumstances , jan soon realized his only option was to leave the country . " my cousin had a friend in munich who helped me get work picking asparagus , " he explained .
" for the first three years i went by myself , then i started to take my wife with me . " leaving the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual aspargus harvest attracts thousands of poles every year jan and violetta earn 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.17 -rrb- an hour picking asparagus in bavaria during the two-month season .
they 've never had problems getting paid on time , but despite taking home good money , they 're well aware there must be easier ways of feeding a family of five . " the early days were the hardest , " said violetta .
" having to leave home to go to work in a foreign country with foreign people was very painful .
we did n't speak a word of german .
it was unbearable .
but i 'm adaptable and i learn fast .
and i knew my children would be well looked after with my parents . " three generations of the gros family share the small house in swietokrzyskie .
but the grandparents are getting older , and can no longer be relied upon to help out . " my mother has always been very supportive , but she 's increasingly unwell , " said violetta .
" when she 's not up to the work on the farm then the neighbor gives her a hand , and when we come back then we help him .
everyone helps each other . " upping the ante but this year , jan and violetta might find themselves stuck at home .
their yearly trip over the border with some thirty other locals currently hangs in the balance due to a new german law which rules that only 80 to 90 percent of last year 's foreign seasonal workers can be hired this year , with unemployed germans picking up the slack . the government 's plans , coupled with a new eu directive that requires seasonal workers to pay higher contributions into poland 's social insurance schemes , have left workers in poland who rely on the annual asparagus harvest concerned they 're about to lose out on this vital source of income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles ' jobs are now in the balance " you have to buy food in germany for the two months that you 're there and the cost of living is very high there , " explained violetta .
" many of our friends wo n't be going , because it 's no longer worth it .
but we hope that we 'll still be able to make a profit and after all , we do n't have anything to lose . " but ultimately , the couple are confident there 's still room for them in germany 's asparagus fields . " it 's been tried before , " pointed out jan .
" the job agency sends along some kids and they only ever last a few hours .
and if the poles do n't do the work , the slovaks will .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.04.2006 berlin protests sidelining of german at eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german has the largest population of native speakers in europe , but is not easy to learn the eu has no less than 20 official languages , yet english remains the undisputed lingua franca of the union .
the german government is now stepping up its efforts to make german more prominent in the eu . the german government is turning up the heat on the european union to ensure all official texts are also published in the german language , officials said on thursday . " germany has a right to have these documents in german , " the deputy foreign minister responsible for europe , günter gloser , told german news agency dpa . the german parliament and the french national assembly issued a statement earlier this month denouncing an " unacceptable drift toward a monolingual system " dominated by english .
bundestag president norbert lammert wrote in a letter to eu commission president jose manuel barroso that the german parliament would refuse to debate eu documents that were not printed in the language of goethe . the eu is expected to respond before the next eu summit in june . brussels as the new babel the eu currently has 20 official languages and plans to add irish , romanian and bulgarian to the list next year . in a measure to prevent paperwork overload , only legislations and documents of major public interest are translated in all 20 official languages .
for internal purposes , each eu institution is allowed by law to make its own language arrangements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament resembles a 21st century tower of babel the council of europe , for example , publishes its web site in the language of the council 's rotating presidency as well as english and french .
proponents of the german language in the eu , however , strongly disagree with this practice . " if the council presidency has to use only two languages because of personnel and financial reasons , then these two languages would have to be english and german , " said dietrich voslamber of the german language association .
" that way , they would reach the most people in europe . " twenty-four percent of eu citizens have german as their mother tongue , while english , french and italian are each spoken by approximately 16 percent of the eu population . simply choosing german over french , however , would probably not go down very well in paris .
french president jacques chirac , an ardent champion of the french language , demonstratively walked out of the first working session of a eu summit in march in protest because the head of europe 's employers ' association , a frenchman , spoke in english . lost in translation finland , which takes over the eu presidency in july , denied media reports earlier this month that it would snub german or any other eu language when it opens its official eu presidency web site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union is the largest translation operation in the world prime minister matti vanhanen 's office dismissed allegations that finland would " snub " german , the most common native language in the eu with 90 million speakers , by opening two official web sites , one in english and one in french . running an international , multilingual machinery such as the european union remains a complex and expensive enterprise .
according to official eu figures , the union spent 1.1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- in 2005 on translation services .
the cost of maintaining the administration in 20 languages amounts to 1 percent of the eu 's annual general budget . eu institutions require some 80 interpreters per language on a daily basis .
approximately half of those interpreters work at the european parliament .

a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money . in the past , the german government has focused on women in its attempt to raise the country 's birth rate .
yet german women are having fewer children than ever before .
overall , german women have an average of 1.37 children , compared wiht 1.75 in sweden and 1.74 in the uk . in surveys , many women say that finding the right father , as well as career pressures , keeps motherhood at bay .
the government has been working on ways to make motherhood more attractive to women , for example , by improving the country 's daycare offerings .
but the state is also training its sights on the men , with monetary incentives for fathers to trade their desks for the diaper-changing table .
the law proposed by the coalition government of cdu and spd calls for wage-based parenting subsidies .
starting in 2007 , parents would receive 67 percent of their net incomes , up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,221 -rrb- a month , to stay at home for the first year of their child 's life .
a stipulation to the proposal made by family affairs minister ursula von der leyen would require the father to spend at least two of the 12 months at home .
otherwise the last two months of funding would be withheld . paying mr. mom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen thinks fathers should help raise the kids opposition parties and women 's groups - while showing wide acceptance for the income-based scheme - have pointed out that a lack of child care for children under age three in germany may lead to a child-care gap for parents after the 12 months are up .
but von der leyen has received criticism from within her own christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for the " papa proposal . " " it is not the government 's place to tell families how to raise their children , " thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the leipziger zeitung . " what is important is that more children are born , not who is doing the dishes , " said saxony 's premier georg milbradt . but volker baisch , father and president of väter e.v. , an organization in hamburg that advises fathers , disagrees .
he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .
since 1998 , german law has given them that option .
but only 5 percent of the fathers actually end up pushing baby carriages full time .
would more money really help ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's changing father figure in sweden , where the two-month " papa " model proposed by minister von der leyen has been in effect for decades , more than 18 percent of fathers stay home for some length of time .
volker baisch of vater e.v. believes that the new law could mean a 10 percent increase in active fathers .
but money is not the only issue keeping men at work . " men are worried about broaching the topic with their bosses , " baisch said .
" but the fact is that men who spend time at home with their kids are good for business as well . " studies have shown that part-time employees are more effective , less likely to take off sick , and generally more satisfied with their jobs .
their partners are happier too , because they are sharing the work at home . " it is a win-win situation , both for the families and for their employers , " baisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising kids is a family affair sparking a mental change but changing germany 's father figure from full time bread-winner to part-time bread baker is a long road .
volker baisch is afraid that the heated discussion around the two-month paternity leave may have given it a bad rap among business owners - and fathers-to-be - before it has even hit the ground . but the father of two is still convinced that the new legislation will get more dads out to the local playground .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.04.2006 berlin protests sidelining of german at eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german has the largest population of native speakers in europe , but is not easy to learn the eu has no less than 20 official languages , yet english remains the undisputed lingua franca of the union .
the german government is now stepping up its efforts to make german more prominent in the eu . the german government is turning up the heat on the european union to ensure all official texts are also published in the german language , officials said on thursday . " germany has a right to have these documents in german , " the deputy foreign minister responsible for europe , günter gloser , told german news agency dpa . the german parliament and the french national assembly issued a statement earlier this month denouncing an " unacceptable drift toward a monolingual system " dominated by english .
bundestag president norbert lammert wrote in a letter to eu commission president jose manuel barroso that the german parliament would refuse to debate eu documents that were not printed in the language of goethe . the eu is expected to respond before the next eu summit in june . brussels as the new babel the eu currently has 20 official languages and plans to add irish , romanian and bulgarian to the list next year . in a measure to prevent paperwork overload , only legislations and documents of major public interest are translated in all 20 official languages .
for internal purposes , each eu institution is allowed by law to make its own language arrangements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament resembles a 21st century tower of babel the council of europe , for example , publishes its web site in the language of the council 's rotating presidency as well as english and french .
proponents of the german language in the eu , however , strongly disagree with this practice . " if the council presidency has to use only two languages because of personnel and financial reasons , then these two languages would have to be english and german , " said dietrich voslamber of the german language association .
" that way , they would reach the most people in europe . " twenty-four percent of eu citizens have german as their mother tongue , while english , french and italian are each spoken by approximately 16 percent of the eu population . simply choosing german over french , however , would probably not go down very well in paris .
french president jacques chirac , an ardent champion of the french language , demonstratively walked out of the first working session of a eu summit in march in protest because the head of europe 's employers ' association , a frenchman , spoke in english . lost in translation finland , which takes over the eu presidency in july , denied media reports earlier this month that it would snub german or any other eu language when it opens its official eu presidency web site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union is the largest translation operation in the world prime minister matti vanhanen 's office dismissed allegations that finland would " snub " german , the most common native language in the eu with 90 million speakers , by opening two official web sites , one in english and one in french . running an international , multilingual machinery such as the european union remains a complex and expensive enterprise .
according to official eu figures , the union spent 1.1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- in 2005 on translation services .
the cost of maintaining the administration in 20 languages amounts to 1 percent of the eu 's annual general budget . eu institutions require some 80 interpreters per language on a daily basis .
approximately half of those interpreters work at the european parliament .

while soccer fans prepare for the month-long extravaganza that is the world cup , many of their unenthusiastic partners are considering fleeing the soccer madness and finding companies willing to help them escape . what is a soccer widow to do this summer ?
whether the love of her life is sprawled out on the couch for a month , beer in hand , bellowing something incomprehensible and abusive at the television or whether he is in germany following his team , chances are there are going to be many women who don ’ t share their partner 's enthusiasm for the world cup . while many may see this as a break from the usual relationship merry-go-round in itself , there are alternatives to ferrying in snacks , restocking the fridge or waiting for his team to get knocked out with sympathetic words at the ready .
why not simply take off and leave the world cup behind ? travel and tourism companies have already spotted the potential of the soccer widow market and have started advertising getaway packages and enticing those for whom a month-long soccer tournament is a personal hell . take the swiss tourism board ’ s cheeky ambush marketing campaign which features a selection of hunky men , stretching and flexing while a sexy voice intones : " dear girls , why not escape this summer ’ s world cup to a country where men spend less time on football , and more time on you ? " hunky swiss with more on their minds than soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist these fine young swiss men ?
the 35-second advert , which will begin its run on french , german and swiss television from the start of may , features a farmhand , a cable car conductor , a mountain climber , a ferryman and a couple of brawny lumberjacks before signing off with renzo blumenthal - mr switzerland 2005 and a real-life farmer - milking and then leaning up against a cow while pouting provocatively . the swiss tourism board is hoping that female tourists from switzerland 's neighbors will leave their men on the couch , in the bar , or at the stadium and get away from world cup fever in the alps .
the smoldering ad may even bring in male visitors .
" it is certainly not aimed at gay tourists , but if they like it and come to switzerland because of it , that 's fine , " a campaign spokeswoman said in a statement . the swiss are not the only ones out to cash in . a number of international air carriers such as british airlines and easyjet are offering cut-price tickets and offers during the world cup to destinations other than germany .
travel agents are also seeing the potential in the soccer widow market . specialist travel agents seeing anti-world cup boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but who 's to say that only men like soccer ?
just you , a specialist holiday company for single travelers , has already seen a 15 percent increase in female tourists booking their holidays for the period of the world cup compared to the june-july period in 2005 .
" it appears that a beautiful beach is more appealing than the beautiful game , " said julie chew , the company ’ s customer services manager , in a recent television interview . " many of the women calling our customer service team have mentioned the prospect of a whole month of soccer motivating them to book a holiday , ” she said .
" more and more people are choosing to holiday alone for a variety of reasons ; however , it does seem the world cup is accelerating this trend . " " northern cyprus and mauritius are proving to be popular beach destinations , though our 9-day break to new england and new york is a big draw for shoppers . " whether or not you 're looking to get away from a particular game or for the whole month , there seems to be plenty on offer for those soccer widows willing not to grieve about the loss of their loved one for the duration of the world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for the world cup tourists germany are set to reap the rewards of hosting the 2006 world cup to the tune of an estimated € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- , according to interior minister otto schily , speaking at a tourism conference in berlin on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.04.2006 berlin protests sidelining of german at eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german has the largest population of native speakers in europe , but is not easy to learn the eu has no less than 20 official languages , yet english remains the undisputed lingua franca of the union .
the german government is now stepping up its efforts to make german more prominent in the eu . the german government is turning up the heat on the european union to ensure all official texts are also published in the german language , officials said on thursday . " germany has a right to have these documents in german , " the deputy foreign minister responsible for europe , günter gloser , told german news agency dpa . the german parliament and the french national assembly issued a statement earlier this month denouncing an " unacceptable drift toward a monolingual system " dominated by english .
bundestag president norbert lammert wrote in a letter to eu commission president jose manuel barroso that the german parliament would refuse to debate eu documents that were not printed in the language of goethe . the eu is expected to respond before the next eu summit in june . brussels as the new babel the eu currently has 20 official languages and plans to add irish , romanian and bulgarian to the list next year . in a measure to prevent paperwork overload , only legislations and documents of major public interest are translated in all 20 official languages .
for internal purposes , each eu institution is allowed by law to make its own language arrangements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament resembles a 21st century tower of babel the council of europe , for example , publishes its web site in the language of the council 's rotating presidency as well as english and french .
proponents of the german language in the eu , however , strongly disagree with this practice . " if the council presidency has to use only two languages because of personnel and financial reasons , then these two languages would have to be english and german , " said dietrich voslamber of the german language association .
" that way , they would reach the most people in europe . " twenty-four percent of eu citizens have german as their mother tongue , while english , french and italian are each spoken by approximately 16 percent of the eu population . simply choosing german over french , however , would probably not go down very well in paris .
french president jacques chirac , an ardent champion of the french language , demonstratively walked out of the first working session of a eu summit in march in protest because the head of europe 's employers ' association , a frenchman , spoke in english . lost in translation finland , which takes over the eu presidency in july , denied media reports earlier this month that it would snub german or any other eu language when it opens its official eu presidency web site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union is the largest translation operation in the world prime minister matti vanhanen 's office dismissed allegations that finland would " snub " german , the most common native language in the eu with 90 million speakers , by opening two official web sites , one in english and one in french . running an international , multilingual machinery such as the european union remains a complex and expensive enterprise .
according to official eu figures , the union spent 1.1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- in 2005 on translation services .
the cost of maintaining the administration in 20 languages amounts to 1 percent of the eu 's annual general budget . eu institutions require some 80 interpreters per language on a daily basis .
approximately half of those interpreters work at the european parliament .
their job is to make sure that parliamentarians do n't get lost in translation , and that the english phrase " out of sight , out of mind , " for instance , does not become " invisible , insane " when rendered in other eu languages . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : spelling reform spells trouble for germany germany is changing its orthography for the second time in 10 years .
politicians are praising the revised set of rules , but it is unlikely that the second-hand reform will put an end to german spelling woes .
-lrb- march 9 , 2006 -rrb- preserving germany 's linguistic heritage for years , unesco has been appealing to nations across the globe to promote their indigenous languages by filling classrooms with their multi-colored vernacular .

a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money . in the past , the german government has focused on women in its attempt to raise the country 's birth rate .
yet german women are having fewer children than ever before .
overall , german women have an average of 1.37 children , compared wiht 1.75 in sweden and 1.74 in the uk . in surveys , many women say that finding the right father , as well as career pressures , keeps motherhood at bay .
the government has been working on ways to make motherhood more attractive to women , for example , by improving the country 's daycare offerings .
but the state is also training its sights on the men , with monetary incentives for fathers to trade their desks for the diaper-changing table .
the law proposed by the coalition government of cdu and spd calls for wage-based parenting subsidies .
starting in 2007 , parents would receive 67 percent of their net incomes , up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,221 -rrb- a month , to stay at home for the first year of their child 's life .
a stipulation to the proposal made by family affairs minister ursula von der leyen would require the father to spend at least two of the 12 months at home .
otherwise the last two months of funding would be withheld . paying mr. mom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen thinks fathers should help raise the kids opposition parties and women 's groups - while showing wide acceptance for the income-based scheme - have pointed out that a lack of child care for children under age three in germany may lead to a child-care gap for parents after the 12 months are up .
but von der leyen has received criticism from within her own christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for the " papa proposal . " " it is not the government 's place to tell families how to raise their children , " thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the leipziger zeitung . " what is important is that more children are born , not who is doing the dishes , " said saxony 's premier georg milbradt . but volker baisch , father and president of väter e.v. , an organization in hamburg that advises fathers , disagrees .
he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .
since 1998 , german law has given them that option .
but only 5 percent of the fathers actually end up pushing baby carriages full time .
would more money really help ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's changing father figure in sweden , where the two-month " papa " model proposed by minister von der leyen has been in effect for decades , more than 18 percent of fathers stay home for some length of time .
volker baisch of vater e.v. believes that the new law could mean a 10 percent increase in active fathers .
but money is not the only issue keeping men at work . " men are worried about broaching the topic with their bosses , " baisch said .
" but the fact is that men who spend time at home with their kids are good for business as well . " studies have shown that part-time employees are more effective , less likely to take off sick , and generally more satisfied with their jobs .
their partners are happier too , because they are sharing the work at home . " it is a win-win situation , both for the families and for their employers , " baisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising kids is a family affair sparking a mental change but changing germany 's father figure from full time bread-winner to part-time bread baker is a long road .
volker baisch is afraid that the heated discussion around the two-month paternity leave may have given it a bad rap among business owners - and fathers-to-be - before it has even hit the ground . but the father of two is still convinced that the new legislation will get more dads out to the local playground .

" what is important is that more children are born , not who is doing the dishes , " said saxony 's premier georg milbradt . but volker baisch , father and president of väter e.v. , an organization in hamburg that advises fathers , disagrees .
he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .
since 1998 , german law has given them that option .
but only 5 percent of the fathers actually end up pushing baby carriages full time .
would more money really help ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's changing father figure in sweden , where the two-month " papa " model proposed by minister von der leyen has been in effect for decades , more than 18 percent of fathers stay home for some length of time .
volker baisch of vater e.v. believes that the new law could mean a 10 percent increase in active fathers .
but money is not the only issue keeping men at work . " men are worried about broaching the topic with their bosses , " baisch said .
" but the fact is that men who spend time at home with their kids are good for business as well . " studies have shown that part-time employees are more effective , less likely to take off sick , and generally more satisfied with their jobs .
their partners are happier too , because they are sharing the work at home . " it is a win-win situation , both for the families and for their employers , " baisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising kids is a family affair sparking a mental change but changing germany 's father figure from full time bread-winner to part-time bread baker is a long road .
volker baisch is afraid that the heated discussion around the two-month paternity leave may have given it a bad rap among business owners - and fathers-to-be - before it has even hit the ground . but the father of two is still convinced that the new legislation will get more dads out to the local playground .
whether that will mean more kids to swing on germany 's swing sets , he says , is anyone 's guess . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money . in the past , the german government has focused on women in its attempt to raise the country 's birth rate .
yet german women are having fewer children than ever before .
overall , german women have an average of 1.37 children , compared wiht 1.75 in sweden and 1.74 in the uk . in surveys , many women say that finding the right father , as well as career pressures , keeps motherhood at bay .
the government has been working on ways to make motherhood more attractive to women , for example , by improving the country 's daycare offerings .
but the state is also training its sights on the men , with monetary incentives for fathers to trade their desks for the diaper-changing table .
the law proposed by the coalition government of cdu and spd calls for wage-based parenting subsidies .
starting in 2007 , parents would receive 67 percent of their net incomes , up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,221 -rrb- a month , to stay at home for the first year of their child 's life .
a stipulation to the proposal made by family affairs minister ursula von der leyen would require the father to spend at least two of the 12 months at home .
otherwise the last two months of funding would be withheld . paying mr. mom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen thinks fathers should help raise the kids opposition parties and women 's groups - while showing wide acceptance for the income-based scheme - have pointed out that a lack of child care for children under age three in germany may lead to a child-care gap for parents after the 12 months are up .
but von der leyen has received criticism from within her own christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for the " papa proposal . " " it is not the government 's place to tell families how to raise their children , " thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the leipziger zeitung . " what is important is that more children are born , not who is doing the dishes , " said saxony 's premier georg milbradt . but volker baisch , father and president of väter e.v. , an organization in hamburg that advises fathers , disagrees .
he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .
since 1998 , german law has given them that option .
but only 5 percent of the fathers actually end up pushing baby carriages full time .
would more money really help ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's changing father figure in sweden , where the two-month " papa " model proposed by minister von der leyen has been in effect for decades , more than 18 percent of fathers stay home for some length of time .
volker baisch of vater e.v. believes that the new law could mean a 10 percent increase in active fathers .
but money is not the only issue keeping men at work . " men are worried about broaching the topic with their bosses , " baisch said .
" but the fact is that men who spend time at home with their kids are good for business as well . " studies have shown that part-time employees are more effective , less likely to take off sick , and generally more satisfied with their jobs .
their partners are happier too , because they are sharing the work at home . " it is a win-win situation , both for the families and for their employers , " baisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising kids is a family affair sparking a mental change but changing germany 's father figure from full time bread-winner to part-time bread baker is a long road .
volker baisch is afraid that the heated discussion around the two-month paternity leave may have given it a bad rap among business owners - and fathers-to-be - before it has even hit the ground . but the father of two is still convinced that the new legislation will get more dads out to the local playground .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.04.2006 berlin protests sidelining of german at eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german has the largest population of native speakers in europe , but is not easy to learn the eu has no less than 20 official languages , yet english remains the undisputed lingua franca of the union .
the german government is now stepping up its efforts to make german more prominent in the eu . the german government is turning up the heat on the european union to ensure all official texts are also published in the german language , officials said on thursday . " germany has a right to have these documents in german , " the deputy foreign minister responsible for europe , günter gloser , told german news agency dpa . the german parliament and the french national assembly issued a statement earlier this month denouncing an " unacceptable drift toward a monolingual system " dominated by english .
bundestag president norbert lammert wrote in a letter to eu commission president jose manuel barroso that the german parliament would refuse to debate eu documents that were not printed in the language of goethe . the eu is expected to respond before the next eu summit in june . brussels as the new babel the eu currently has 20 official languages and plans to add irish , romanian and bulgarian to the list next year . in a measure to prevent paperwork overload , only legislations and documents of major public interest are translated in all 20 official languages .
for internal purposes , each eu institution is allowed by law to make its own language arrangements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament resembles a 21st century tower of babel the council of europe , for example , publishes its web site in the language of the council 's rotating presidency as well as english and french .
proponents of the german language in the eu , however , strongly disagree with this practice . " if the council presidency has to use only two languages because of personnel and financial reasons , then these two languages would have to be english and german , " said dietrich voslamber of the german language association .
" that way , they would reach the most people in europe . " twenty-four percent of eu citizens have german as their mother tongue , while english , french and italian are each spoken by approximately 16 percent of the eu population . simply choosing german over french , however , would probably not go down very well in paris .
french president jacques chirac , an ardent champion of the french language , demonstratively walked out of the first working session of a eu summit in march in protest because the head of europe 's employers ' association , a frenchman , spoke in english . lost in translation finland , which takes over the eu presidency in july , denied media reports earlier this month that it would snub german or any other eu language when it opens its official eu presidency web site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union is the largest translation operation in the world prime minister matti vanhanen 's office dismissed allegations that finland would " snub " german , the most common native language in the eu with 90 million speakers , by opening two official web sites , one in english and one in french . running an international , multilingual machinery such as the european union remains a complex and expensive enterprise .
according to official eu figures , the union spent 1.1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- in 2005 on translation services .
the cost of maintaining the administration in 20 languages amounts to 1 percent of the eu 's annual general budget . eu institutions require some 80 interpreters per language on a daily basis .
approximately half of those interpreters work at the european parliament .
their job is to make sure that parliamentarians do n't get lost in translation , and that the english phrase " out of sight , out of mind , " for instance , does not become " invisible , insane " when rendered in other eu languages . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : spelling reform spells trouble for germany germany is changing its orthography for the second time in 10 years .

starting in 2007 , parents would receive 67 percent of their net incomes , up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,221 -rrb- a month , to stay at home for the first year of their child 's life .

but von der leyen has received criticism from within her own christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for the " papa proposal . " " it is not the government 's place to tell families how to raise their children , " thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the leipziger zeitung . " what is important is that more children are born , not who is doing the dishes , " said saxony 's premier georg milbradt . but volker baisch , father and president of väter e.v. , an organization in hamburg that advises fathers , disagrees .
he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .
since 1998 , german law has given them that option .

but money is not the only issue keeping men at work . " men are worried about broaching the topic with their bosses , " baisch said .
" but the fact is that men who spend time at home with their kids are good for business as well . " studies have shown that part-time employees are more effective , less likely to take off sick , and generally more satisfied with their jobs .

one such victim was the german citizen khaled al-masri , who was flown to afghanistan and held for several months as a terrorist suspect by the united states . the european union 's anti-terrorism co-ordinator says that there is no proof yet that the cia organised secret flights and ran detention centers for terror suspects .

but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job . violetta and jan gros live in a remote village in swietokrzyskie province , some 200 kilometers south of the polish capital .
there 's little work to be found in this largely untouched corner of the earth , and come spring , the two farm workers pack their bags and head to germany to join some 300,000 other poles in the country for the annual asparagus harvest . " the region we live in is a very poor , rural area , " explained violetta .
" there are no businesses or factories here , and anyone who can speak a smattering of german ups it and leaves .
there 's practically nothing to do here . " no option the couple are both in their mid-forties and have been unemployed for years .
the polish state provides little in the way of support , and it 's up to them to make ends meet . " i 'm actually a butcher and i worked for the same company for several years , " said jan .
" but then it went bankrupt .

" " the recent statements are a warning sign and should open the eyes of european politicians , " he added . austrian economics minister martin bartenstein said thursday it was high time the eu considered the options . " the message is that the eu would do well to look for alternative pipeline projects , " he said . nonetheless , gazprom and german energy company e.on are continuiung to negotiate the latter 's stake in the yuzhno russkoye gas field in western siberia . politicizing gas supply issues gazprom has risked rekindling tensions that first surfaced in january after the state-run company tightened its taps in a price row with neighboring ukraine , also cutting supplies to some european union countries . bildunterschrift : time to look for new supply routes ?
in a statement on its website , gazprom said it had warned the 25-nation eu not to politicize gas supply issues , threatening to sell fuel elsewhere if its commercial ambitions in the european market were unfairly restricted . " it needs to be noted that attempts to limit gazprom 's activity in the european market and to politicize gas issues , which are in fact solely economic , will not produce good results , " it said . satisfying demand the statement came after gazprom chief alexei miller held what it described as a " frank and objective conversation " in moscow with ambassadors of the 25 eu countries on tuesday , telling them gazprom was " able to satisfy reliably growing gas demand in europe . " " nevertheless , one can not forget that we are actively developing new markets such as north america and china , " he added . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , called on gazprom to stick to its commitments and not to threaten crucial european energy supplies . " the commission expects all suppliers to meet their commercial commitments , " said a commission spokesman .
" in a market that is becoming more and more global , companies are looking for diversification - of suppliers , of routes , " he said , but added : " this diversification should not be used ... to achieve other goals . " changes to law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , the energy question is topping political agendas miller 's meeting with the eu envoys came after the financial times reported unease in britain over news the government there had considered changing the law in order to block a potential takeover by gazprom of british gas supplier centrica . the gazprom statement was a clear warning that europe , which itself has cautioned russia against using its vast energy resources as a " political weapon , " was not the company 's only customer and that it would not react kindly to being blocked from competing in europe 's energy market . " we just want european countries to understand that we have other alternatives in terms of gas sales , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov told the ft .
" if the european union wants our gas , it has to consider our interests as well . " a gazprom source told afp that the company was concerned about discussion in brussels and other eu capitals about the possibility of applying eu anti-monopoly legislation to gazprom to loosen its control over the sprawling gas pipeline network in russia and other parts of the ex-soviet union . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oil and energy top g8 meeting in moscow finance ministers of the group of eight economically-powerful countries gather in moscow friday for two days of talks likely to focus on russia 's swelling clout in world oil and gas markets .

" the goals have been defined , " chief executive bernd pischetsrieder said of the restructuring program .

" i can assure my colleagues there of that . " belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt has personally contacted vw board members to make the case for keeping the plant open and asked the company to provide a guarantee for the jobs there . restructuring seen as long process experts criticized the prolonged restructuring plans and the decision to shelve discussion on pischetsrieder 's contract . " the outcome of the supervisory board meeting has shown that a hard restructuring program at vw is unlikely and that an agreement with employees still needs to be reached , " arndt ellinghorst , an analyst at dresdener kleinwort wasserstein told reporters . volkswagen executives are obviously also planning on time-consuming talks .

one such victim was the german citizen khaled al-masri , who was flown to afghanistan and held for several months as a terrorist suspect by the united states . the european union 's anti-terrorism co-ordinator says that there is no proof yet that the cia organised secret flights and ran detention centers for terror suspects .

" " the recent statements are a warning sign and should open the eyes of european politicians , " he added . austrian economics minister martin bartenstein said thursday it was high time the eu considered the options . " the message is that the eu would do well to look for alternative pipeline projects , " he said . nonetheless , gazprom and german energy company e.on are continuiung to negotiate the latter 's stake in the yuzhno russkoye gas field in western siberia . politicizing gas supply issues gazprom has risked rekindling tensions that first surfaced in january after the state-run company tightened its taps in a price row with neighboring ukraine , also cutting supplies to some european union countries . bildunterschrift : time to look for new supply routes ?
in a statement on its website , gazprom said it had warned the 25-nation eu not to politicize gas supply issues , threatening to sell fuel elsewhere if its commercial ambitions in the european market were unfairly restricted . " it needs to be noted that attempts to limit gazprom 's activity in the european market and to politicize gas issues , which are in fact solely economic , will not produce good results , " it said . satisfying demand the statement came after gazprom chief alexei miller held what it described as a " frank and objective conversation " in moscow with ambassadors of the 25 eu countries on tuesday , telling them gazprom was " able to satisfy reliably growing gas demand in europe . " " nevertheless , one can not forget that we are actively developing new markets such as north america and china , " he added . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , called on gazprom to stick to its commitments and not to threaten crucial european energy supplies . " the commission expects all suppliers to meet their commercial commitments , " said a commission spokesman .
" in a market that is becoming more and more global , companies are looking for diversification - of suppliers , of routes , " he said , but added : " this diversification should not be used ... to achieve other goals . " changes to law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , the energy question is topping political agendas miller 's meeting with the eu envoys came after the financial times reported unease in britain over news the government there had considered changing the law in order to block a potential takeover by gazprom of british gas supplier centrica . the gazprom statement was a clear warning that europe , which itself has cautioned russia against using its vast energy resources as a " political weapon , " was not the company 's only customer and that it would not react kindly to being blocked from competing in europe 's energy market . " we just want european countries to understand that we have other alternatives in terms of gas sales , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov told the ft .
" if the european union wants our gas , it has to consider our interests as well . " a gazprom source told afp that the company was concerned about discussion in brussels and other eu capitals about the possibility of applying eu anti-monopoly legislation to gazprom to loosen its control over the sprawling gas pipeline network in russia and other parts of the ex-soviet union . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oil and energy top g8 meeting in moscow finance ministers of the group of eight economically-powerful countries gather in moscow friday for two days of talks likely to focus on russia 's swelling clout in world oil and gas markets .

but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job . violetta and jan gros live in a remote village in swietokrzyskie province , some 200 kilometers south of the polish capital .
there 's little work to be found in this largely untouched corner of the earth , and come spring , the two farm workers pack their bags and head to germany to join some 300,000 other poles in the country for the annual asparagus harvest . " the region we live in is a very poor , rural area , " explained violetta .
" there are no businesses or factories here , and anyone who can speak a smattering of german ups it and leaves .
there 's practically nothing to do here . " no option the couple are both in their mid-forties and have been unemployed for years .
the polish state provides little in the way of support , and it 's up to them to make ends meet . " i 'm actually a butcher and i worked for the same company for several years , " said jan .
" but then it went bankrupt .
my wife and i own three hectares of land but it 's not enough to live off .
i used to go to work and she took care of the farm , but as soon as i lost my job , times got tough . " in such tight circumstances , jan soon realized his only option was to leave the country . " my cousin had a friend in munich who helped me get work picking asparagus , " he explained .
" for the first three years i went by myself , then i started to take my wife with me . " leaving the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual aspargus harvest attracts thousands of poles every year jan and violetta earn 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.17 -rrb- an hour picking asparagus in bavaria during the two-month season .
they 've never had problems getting paid on time , but despite taking home good money , they 're well aware there must be easier ways of feeding a family of five . " the early days were the hardest , " said violetta .
" having to leave home to go to work in a foreign country with foreign people was very painful .
we did n't speak a word of german .
it was unbearable .
but i 'm adaptable and i learn fast .
and i knew my children would be well looked after with my parents . " three generations of the gros family share the small house in swietokrzyskie .
but the grandparents are getting older , and can no longer be relied upon to help out . " my mother has always been very supportive , but she 's increasingly unwell , " said violetta .
" when she 's not up to the work on the farm then the neighbor gives her a hand , and when we come back then we help him .
everyone helps each other . " upping the ante but this year , jan and violetta might find themselves stuck at home .
their yearly trip over the border with some thirty other locals currently hangs in the balance due to a new german law which rules that only 80 to 90 percent of last year 's foreign seasonal workers can be hired this year , with unemployed germans picking up the slack . the government 's plans , coupled with a new eu directive that requires seasonal workers to pay higher contributions into poland 's social insurance schemes , have left workers in poland who rely on the annual asparagus harvest concerned they 're about to lose out on this vital source of income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles ' jobs are now in the balance " you have to buy food in germany for the two months that you 're there and the cost of living is very high there , " explained violetta .
" many of our friends wo n't be going , because it 's no longer worth it .
but we hope that we 'll still be able to make a profit and after all , we do n't have anything to lose . " but ultimately , the couple are confident there 's still room for them in germany 's asparagus fields . " it 's been tried before , " pointed out jan .
" the job agency sends along some kids and they only ever last a few hours .
and if the poles do n't do the work , the slovaks will .

but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job . violetta and jan gros live in a remote village in swietokrzyskie province , some 200 kilometers south of the polish capital .
there 's little work to be found in this largely untouched corner of the earth , and come spring , the two farm workers pack their bags and head to germany to join some 300,000 other poles in the country for the annual asparagus harvest . " the region we live in is a very poor , rural area , " explained violetta .
" there are no businesses or factories here , and anyone who can speak a smattering of german ups it and leaves .
there 's practically nothing to do here . " no option the couple are both in their mid-forties and have been unemployed for years .
the polish state provides little in the way of support , and it 's up to them to make ends meet . " i 'm actually a butcher and i worked for the same company for several years , " said jan .
" but then it went bankrupt .
my wife and i own three hectares of land but it 's not enough to live off .
i used to go to work and she took care of the farm , but as soon as i lost my job , times got tough . " in such tight circumstances , jan soon realized his only option was to leave the country . " my cousin had a friend in munich who helped me get work picking asparagus , " he explained .
" for the first three years i went by myself , then i started to take my wife with me . " leaving the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual aspargus harvest attracts thousands of poles every year jan and violetta earn 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.17 -rrb- an hour picking asparagus in bavaria during the two-month season .
they 've never had problems getting paid on time , but despite taking home good money , they 're well aware there must be easier ways of feeding a family of five . " the early days were the hardest , " said violetta .
" having to leave home to go to work in a foreign country with foreign people was very painful .
we did n't speak a word of german .
it was unbearable .
but i 'm adaptable and i learn fast .
and i knew my children would be well looked after with my parents . " three generations of the gros family share the small house in swietokrzyskie .
but the grandparents are getting older , and can no longer be relied upon to help out . " my mother has always been very supportive , but she 's increasingly unwell , " said violetta .
" when she 's not up to the work on the farm then the neighbor gives her a hand , and when we come back then we help him .
everyone helps each other . " upping the ante but this year , jan and violetta might find themselves stuck at home .
their yearly trip over the border with some thirty other locals currently hangs in the balance due to a new german law which rules that only 80 to 90 percent of last year 's foreign seasonal workers can be hired this year , with unemployed germans picking up the slack . the government 's plans , coupled with a new eu directive that requires seasonal workers to pay higher contributions into poland 's social insurance schemes , have left workers in poland who rely on the annual asparagus harvest concerned they 're about to lose out on this vital source of income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles ' jobs are now in the balance " you have to buy food in germany for the two months that you 're there and the cost of living is very high there , " explained violetta .
" many of our friends wo n't be going , because it 's no longer worth it .
but we hope that we 'll still be able to make a profit and after all , we do n't have anything to lose . " but ultimately , the couple are confident there 's still room for them in germany 's asparagus fields . " it 's been tried before , " pointed out jan .
" the job agency sends along some kids and they only ever last a few hours .
and if the poles do n't do the work , the slovaks will .

while soccer fans prepare for the month-long extravaganza that is the world cup , many of their unenthusiastic partners are considering fleeing the soccer madness and finding companies willing to help them escape . what is a soccer widow to do this summer ?
whether the love of her life is sprawled out on the couch for a month , beer in hand , bellowing something incomprehensible and abusive at the television or whether he is in germany following his team , chances are there are going to be many women who don ’ t share their partner 's enthusiasm for the world cup . while many may see this as a break from the usual relationship merry-go-round in itself , there are alternatives to ferrying in snacks , restocking the fridge or waiting for his team to get knocked out with sympathetic words at the ready .
why not simply take off and leave the world cup behind ? travel and tourism companies have already spotted the potential of the soccer widow market and have started advertising getaway packages and enticing those for whom a month-long soccer tournament is a personal hell . take the swiss tourism board ’ s cheeky ambush marketing campaign which features a selection of hunky men , stretching and flexing while a sexy voice intones : " dear girls , why not escape this summer ’ s world cup to a country where men spend less time on football , and more time on you ? " hunky swiss with more on their minds than soccer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who could resist these fine young swiss men ?
the 35-second advert , which will begin its run on french , german and swiss television from the start of may , features a farmhand , a cable car conductor , a mountain climber , a ferryman and a couple of brawny lumberjacks before signing off with renzo blumenthal - mr switzerland 2005 and a real-life farmer - milking and then leaning up against a cow while pouting provocatively . the swiss tourism board is hoping that female tourists from switzerland 's neighbors will leave their men on the couch , in the bar , or at the stadium and get away from world cup fever in the alps .
the smoldering ad may even bring in male visitors .
" it is certainly not aimed at gay tourists , but if they like it and come to switzerland because of it , that 's fine , " a campaign spokeswoman said in a statement . the swiss are not the only ones out to cash in . a number of international air carriers such as british airlines and easyjet are offering cut-price tickets and offers during the world cup to destinations other than germany .
travel agents are also seeing the potential in the soccer widow market . specialist travel agents seeing anti-world cup boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but who 's to say that only men like soccer ?
just you , a specialist holiday company for single travelers , has already seen a 15 percent increase in female tourists booking their holidays for the period of the world cup compared to the june-july period in 2005 .
" it appears that a beautiful beach is more appealing than the beautiful game , " said julie chew , the company ’ s customer services manager , in a recent television interview . " many of the women calling our customer service team have mentioned the prospect of a whole month of soccer motivating them to book a holiday , ” she said .
" more and more people are choosing to holiday alone for a variety of reasons ; however , it does seem the world cup is accelerating this trend . " " northern cyprus and mauritius are proving to be popular beach destinations , though our 9-day break to new england and new york is a big draw for shoppers . " whether or not you 're looking to get away from a particular game or for the whole month , there seems to be plenty on offer for those soccer widows willing not to grieve about the loss of their loved one for the duration of the world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de waiting for the world cup tourists germany are set to reap the rewards of hosting the 2006 world cup to the tune of an estimated € 3 billion -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- , according to interior minister otto schily , speaking at a tourism conference in berlin on tuesday .

"
as the sun comes out and germany 's multitude of beer gardens begin opening for the spring and summer season , the society against dishonest pouring is out making sure that punters are n't being short-changed at the tap . there is only one way millions of germans get true summer refreshment , and it comes in the form of a freshly tapped glass of beer . and just as every king needs the perfect crown , germans know every beer requires a perfect frothy head on top .
but they 're still stingy about trading too much potential beer space for the sudsy spray , and have clearly marked every glass with a line to make sure they 're getting their euros ' worth of golden liquid . alas , when patrons start tipping back their fourth , fifth or sixth glass , some bar proprietors try to take them for a ride .
but that 's when the society against dishonest pouring steps in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheers to full beers !
" badly poured beers are among the largest problems in beer gardens , restaurants and at the oktoberfest , " the society wrote on its web site . the sadp estimates that being poured a finger 's width less of lager costs patrons 4.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- worth of beer at munich 's annual oktoberfest alone . how to perform the index finger text in case further proof of how seriously germans take their beer - remember , there is a near-holy law dictating exactly what can go into a bottle of brew - the sadp started putting beer pouring technique under the microscope back in 1899 . the society 's web site even offers tips on how to judge whether a beer is poorly poured : after the server brings your drink , wait a moment for the head and beer to settle .
now perform the index finger test .
put your index finder on the standard mark ; if the beer does not begin directly below your finder , the beer has been poured badly .
the society confirmed its raison d 'etre at a munich beer festival last month where none of the 20 steins it tested contained a full liter -lrb- about 34 fluid ounces -rrb- of beer . those looking to join the illustrious group of beer detectives can download registration forms or show up at the regular meetings on the first and third tuesday of the month in munich 's famed hofbraühaus . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drink more to smoke less a german company - in an ultimate act of retro defiance - has announced its plans to produce nicotine-laced beer .
bars and restaurants may soon see decreasing levels of nervous finger-tapping and panicky lip-biting .

but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job . violetta and jan gros live in a remote village in swietokrzyskie province , some 200 kilometers south of the polish capital .
there 's little work to be found in this largely untouched corner of the earth , and come spring , the two farm workers pack their bags and head to germany to join some 300,000 other poles in the country for the annual asparagus harvest . " the region we live in is a very poor , rural area , " explained violetta .
" there are no businesses or factories here , and anyone who can speak a smattering of german ups it and leaves .
there 's practically nothing to do here . " no option the couple are both in their mid-forties and have been unemployed for years .
the polish state provides little in the way of support , and it 's up to them to make ends meet . " i 'm actually a butcher and i worked for the same company for several years , " said jan .
" but then it went bankrupt .
my wife and i own three hectares of land but it 's not enough to live off .
i used to go to work and she took care of the farm , but as soon as i lost my job , times got tough . " in such tight circumstances , jan soon realized his only option was to leave the country . " my cousin had a friend in munich who helped me get work picking asparagus , " he explained .
" for the first three years i went by myself , then i started to take my wife with me .

they 've never had problems getting paid on time , but despite taking home good money , they 're well aware there must be easier ways of feeding a family of five . " the early days were the hardest , " said violetta .
" having to leave home to go to work in a foreign country with foreign people was very painful .

everyone helps each other . " upping the ante but this year , jan and violetta might find themselves stuck at home .
their yearly trip over the border with some thirty other locals currently hangs in the balance due to a new german law which rules that only 80 to 90 percent of last year 's foreign seasonal workers can be hired this year , with unemployed germans picking up the slack . the government 's plans , coupled with a new eu directive that requires seasonal workers to pay higher contributions into poland 's social insurance schemes , have left workers in poland who rely on the annual asparagus harvest concerned they 're about to lose out on this vital source of income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles ' jobs are now in the balance " you have to buy food in germany for the two months that you 're there and the cost of living is very high there , " explained violetta .

but we hope that we 'll still be able to make a profit and after all , we do n't have anything to lose . " but ultimately , the couple are confident there 's still room for them in germany 's asparagus fields . " it 's been tried before , " pointed out jan .

but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job . violetta and jan gros live in a remote village in swietokrzyskie province , some 200 kilometers south of the polish capital .
there 's little work to be found in this largely untouched corner of the earth , and come spring , the two farm workers pack their bags and head to germany to join some 300,000 other poles in the country for the annual asparagus harvest . " the region we live in is a very poor , rural area , " explained violetta .
" there are no businesses or factories here , and anyone who can speak a smattering of german ups it and leaves .
there 's practically nothing to do here . " no option the couple are both in their mid-forties and have been unemployed for years .
the polish state provides little in the way of support , and it 's up to them to make ends meet . " i 'm actually a butcher and i worked for the same company for several years , " said jan .
" but then it went bankrupt .
my wife and i own three hectares of land but it 's not enough to live off .
i used to go to work and she took care of the farm , but as soon as i lost my job , times got tough . " in such tight circumstances , jan soon realized his only option was to leave the country . " my cousin had a friend in munich who helped me get work picking asparagus , " he explained .
" for the first three years i went by myself , then i started to take my wife with me . " leaving the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual aspargus harvest attracts thousands of poles every year jan and violetta earn 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.17 -rrb- an hour picking asparagus in bavaria during the two-month season .
they 've never had problems getting paid on time , but despite taking home good money , they 're well aware there must be easier ways of feeding a family of five . " the early days were the hardest , " said violetta .
" having to leave home to go to work in a foreign country with foreign people was very painful .
we did n't speak a word of german .
it was unbearable .
but i 'm adaptable and i learn fast .
and i knew my children would be well looked after with my parents . " three generations of the gros family share the small house in swietokrzyskie .
but the grandparents are getting older , and can no longer be relied upon to help out . " my mother has always been very supportive , but she 's increasingly unwell , " said violetta .
" when she 's not up to the work on the farm then the neighbor gives her a hand , and when we come back then we help him .
everyone helps each other . " upping the ante but this year , jan and violetta might find themselves stuck at home .
their yearly trip over the border with some thirty other locals currently hangs in the balance due to a new german law which rules that only 80 to 90 percent of last year 's foreign seasonal workers can be hired this year , with unemployed germans picking up the slack . the government 's plans , coupled with a new eu directive that requires seasonal workers to pay higher contributions into poland 's social insurance schemes , have left workers in poland who rely on the annual asparagus harvest concerned they 're about to lose out on this vital source of income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles ' jobs are now in the balance " you have to buy food in germany for the two months that you 're there and the cost of living is very high there , " explained violetta .
" many of our friends wo n't be going , because it 's no longer worth it .
but we hope that we 'll still be able to make a profit and after all , we do n't have anything to lose . " but ultimately , the couple are confident there 's still room for them in germany 's asparagus fields . " it 's been tried before , " pointed out jan .
" the job agency sends along some kids and they only ever last a few hours .

one such victim was the german citizen khaled al-masri , who was flown to afghanistan and held for several months as a terrorist suspect by the united states . the european union 's anti-terrorism co-ordinator says that there is no proof yet that the cia organised secret flights and ran detention centers for terror suspects .

the german government is now stepping up its efforts to make german more prominent in the eu . the german government is turning up the heat on the european union to ensure all official texts are also published in the german language , officials said on thursday . " germany has a right to have these documents in german , " the deputy foreign minister responsible for europe , günter gloser , told german news agency dpa . the german parliament and the french national assembly issued a statement earlier this month denouncing an " unacceptable drift toward a monolingual system " dominated by english .
bundestag president norbert lammert wrote in a letter to eu commission president jose manuel barroso that the german parliament would refuse to debate eu documents that were not printed in the language of goethe . the eu is expected to respond before the next eu summit in june . brussels as the new babel the eu currently has 20 official languages and plans to add irish , romanian and bulgarian to the list next year . in a measure to prevent paperwork overload , only legislations and documents of major public interest are translated in all 20 official languages .
for internal purposes , each eu institution is allowed by law to make its own language arrangements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament resembles a 21st century tower of babel the council of europe , for example , publishes its web site in the language of the council 's rotating presidency as well as english and french .
proponents of the german language in the eu , however , strongly disagree with this practice .

" that way , they would reach the most people in europe . " twenty-four percent of eu citizens have german as their mother tongue , while english , french and italian are each spoken by approximately 16 percent of the eu population . simply choosing german over french , however , would probably not go down very well in paris .
french president jacques chirac , an ardent champion of the french language , demonstratively walked out of the first working session of a eu summit in march in protest because the head of europe 's employers ' association , a frenchman , spoke in english . lost in translation finland , which takes over the eu presidency in july , denied media reports earlier this month that it would snub german or any other eu language when it opens its official eu presidency web site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union is the largest translation operation in the world prime minister matti vanhanen 's office dismissed allegations that finland would " snub " german , the most common native language in the eu with 90 million speakers , by opening two official web sites , one in english and one in french . running an international , multilingual machinery such as the european union remains a complex and expensive enterprise .
according to official eu figures , the union spent 1.1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- in 2005 on translation services .
the cost of maintaining the administration in 20 languages amounts to 1 percent of the eu 's annual general budget . eu institutions require some 80 interpreters per language on a daily basis .

the german government is now stepping up its efforts to make german more prominent in the eu . the german government is turning up the heat on the european union to ensure all official texts are also published in the german language , officials said on thursday . " germany has a right to have these documents in german , " the deputy foreign minister responsible for europe , günter gloser , told german news agency dpa . the german parliament and the french national assembly issued a statement earlier this month denouncing an " unacceptable drift toward a monolingual system " dominated by english .
bundestag president norbert lammert wrote in a letter to eu commission president jose manuel barroso that the german parliament would refuse to debate eu documents that were not printed in the language of goethe . the eu is expected to respond before the next eu summit in june . brussels as the new babel the eu currently has 20 official languages and plans to add irish , romanian and bulgarian to the list next year . in a measure to prevent paperwork overload , only legislations and documents of major public interest are translated in all 20 official languages .
for internal purposes , each eu institution is allowed by law to make its own language arrangements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament resembles a 21st century tower of babel the council of europe , for example , publishes its web site in the language of the council 's rotating presidency as well as english and french .
proponents of the german language in the eu , however , strongly disagree with this practice . " if the council presidency has to use only two languages because of personnel and financial reasons , then these two languages would have to be english and german , " said dietrich voslamber of the german language association .
" that way , they would reach the most people in europe . " twenty-four percent of eu citizens have german as their mother tongue , while english , french and italian are each spoken by approximately 16 percent of the eu population . simply choosing german over french , however , would probably not go down very well in paris .
french president jacques chirac , an ardent champion of the french language , demonstratively walked out of the first working session of a eu summit in march in protest because the head of europe 's employers ' association , a frenchman , spoke in english . lost in translation finland , which takes over the eu presidency in july , denied media reports earlier this month that it would snub german or any other eu language when it opens its official eu presidency web site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union is the largest translation operation in the world prime minister matti vanhanen 's office dismissed allegations that finland would " snub " german , the most common native language in the eu with 90 million speakers , by opening two official web sites , one in english and one in french . running an international , multilingual machinery such as the european union remains a complex and expensive enterprise .
according to official eu figures , the union spent 1.1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.4 million -rrb- in 2005 on translation services .
the cost of maintaining the administration in 20 languages amounts to 1 percent of the eu 's annual general budget . eu institutions require some 80 interpreters per language on a daily basis .
approximately half of those interpreters work at the european parliament .
their job is to make sure that parliamentarians do n't get lost in translation , and that the english phrase " out of sight , out of mind , " for instance , does not become " invisible , insane " when rendered in other eu languages . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : spelling reform spells trouble for germany germany is changing its orthography for the second time in 10 years .

a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money . in the past , the german government has focused on women in its attempt to raise the country 's birth rate .
yet german women are having fewer children than ever before .
overall , german women have an average of 1.37 children , compared wiht 1.75 in sweden and 1.74 in the uk . in surveys , many women say that finding the right father , as well as career pressures , keeps motherhood at bay .
the government has been working on ways to make motherhood more attractive to women , for example , by improving the country 's daycare offerings .
but the state is also training its sights on the men , with monetary incentives for fathers to trade their desks for the diaper-changing table .
the law proposed by the coalition government of cdu and spd calls for wage-based parenting subsidies .
starting in 2007 , parents would receive 67 percent of their net incomes , up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,221 -rrb- a month , to stay at home for the first year of their child 's life .
a stipulation to the proposal made by family affairs minister ursula von der leyen would require the father to spend at least two of the 12 months at home .
otherwise the last two months of funding would be withheld . paying mr. mom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen thinks fathers should help raise the kids opposition parties and women 's groups - while showing wide acceptance for the income-based scheme - have pointed out that a lack of child care for children under age three in germany may lead to a child-care gap for parents after the 12 months are up .
but von der leyen has received criticism from within her own christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for the " papa proposal . " " it is not the government 's place to tell families how to raise their children , " thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the leipziger zeitung . " what is important is that more children are born , not who is doing the dishes , " said saxony 's premier georg milbradt . but volker baisch , father and president of väter e.v. , an organization in hamburg that advises fathers , disagrees .
he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .
since 1998 , german law has given them that option .
but only 5 percent of the fathers actually end up pushing baby carriages full time .
would more money really help ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's changing father figure in sweden , where the two-month " papa " model proposed by minister von der leyen has been in effect for decades , more than 18 percent of fathers stay home for some length of time .
volker baisch of vater e.v. believes that the new law could mean a 10 percent increase in active fathers .
but money is not the only issue keeping men at work . " men are worried about broaching the topic with their bosses , " baisch said .
" but the fact is that men who spend time at home with their kids are good for business as well . " studies have shown that part-time employees are more effective , less likely to take off sick , and generally more satisfied with their jobs .
their partners are happier too , because they are sharing the work at home . " it is a win-win situation , both for the families and for their employers , " baisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising kids is a family affair sparking a mental change but changing germany 's father figure from full time bread-winner to part-time bread baker is a long road .
volker baisch is afraid that the heated discussion around the two-month paternity leave may have given it a bad rap among business owners - and fathers-to-be - before it has even hit the ground . but the father of two is still convinced that the new legislation will get more dads out to the local playground .

their partners are happier too , because they are sharing the work at home . " it is a win-win situation , both for the families and for their employers , " baisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising kids is a family affair sparking a mental change but changing germany 's father figure from full time bread-winner to part-time bread baker is a long road .

one such victim was the german citizen khaled al-masri , who was flown to afghanistan and held for several months as a terrorist suspect by the united states . the european union 's anti-terrorism co-ordinator says that there is no proof yet that the cia organised secret flights and ran detention centers for terror suspects .

a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money . in the past , the german government has focused on women in its attempt to raise the country 's birth rate .
yet german women are having fewer children than ever before .
overall , german women have an average of 1.37 children , compared wiht 1.75 in sweden and 1.74 in the uk . in surveys , many women say that finding the right father , as well as career pressures , keeps motherhood at bay .
the government has been working on ways to make motherhood more attractive to women , for example , by improving the country 's daycare offerings .
but the state is also training its sights on the men , with monetary incentives for fathers to trade their desks for the diaper-changing table .
the law proposed by the coalition government of cdu and spd calls for wage-based parenting subsidies .
starting in 2007 , parents would receive 67 percent of their net incomes , up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,221 -rrb- a month , to stay at home for the first year of their child 's life .

but von der leyen has received criticism from within her own christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for the " papa proposal . " " it is not the government 's place to tell families how to raise their children , " thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the leipziger zeitung . " what is important is that more children are born , not who is doing the dishes , " said saxony 's premier georg milbradt . but volker baisch , father and president of väter e.v. , an organization in hamburg that advises fathers , disagrees .
he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .
since 1998 , german law has given them that option .
but only 5 percent of the fathers actually end up pushing baby carriages full time .

but money is not the only issue keeping men at work . " men are worried about broaching the topic with their bosses , " baisch said .
" but the fact is that men who spend time at home with their kids are good for business as well . " studies have shown that part-time employees are more effective , less likely to take off sick , and generally more satisfied with their jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.04.2006 saving the last " nazi " church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jesus , a german soldier and an aryan family adorn the pulpit a protestant parish is trying to raise money to restore the martin luther memorial church in berlin - and its national socialist ornamentation - as a memorial to the victims of the nazis . the imposing martin luther memorial church in mariendorf , south berlin , looks like many others built in the 20th century , with its brick and stone bauhaus-style exterior .
but the last surviving nazi-era church in germany is also a place where pastors preached from pulpits adorned with aryans , and babies were baptised in a font featuring carvings of a nazi storm trooper .
in fact , the national socialist link is clear from the outset .
in the lobby , an iron cross chandelier illuminates the busts of martin luther and field marshall paul von hindenburg , germany 's famous world war i commander .
church officials believe that there was initially a likeness of adolf hitler - after whom the church was supposed to be named .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swastikas have been removed in the main part of the church , stained glass windows framed by a stone arch face pews for 800 worshipers and a giant organ .
the organ was first used at national socialist rallies in nuremberg in 1935 - the year the church was opened and two years after hitler came to power .
the huge stone archway has friezes on its square panels .
images of crosses and other religious symbols are next to those of workers , soldiers , eagles and some blank panels - the swastikas were removed because they are illegal in germany .
the altar features a jesus that could have been a body builder . " everything is about power , strength and victory , " said ilse klein , a historian who works at the church .
“ they are clearly fascist symbols . ” saving their church the church was originally designed in 1928 before the nazis seized power .
it was in continuous use until two years ago , when the stability of the tower was threatened and tiles began falling off .
the parish has been lobbying the government of berlin and the protestant church organizations for the 3.5 million euros they need to rebuild .
but there are hundreds of churches in germany in need of money and the city of berlin is practically broke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis tried to force churches to take on their ideology as a result , the parish leaders hope to get historical designation from the city so that they can then apply for funds set aside for historical landmarks from foundations .
and though they don ’ t plan to use the church again for regular services , they hope to hold special ceremonies , concerts and exhibitions marking anniversaries such as the liberation of auschwitz concentration camp on jan .
27 , 1945 . “ it was the times , ” said klein .
“ but it is not common anymore to see politics illustrated inside of a church so clearly .
that is why we want to save it - to remind people this should never happen again . ”
storm troopers of jesus many nazi-era buildings have been preserved and are still in use today . berlin 's olympic stadium , for example , was designed by hitler ’ s favorite architect , albert speer in 1936 , and the nazi ’ s central bank is now used by the foreign ministry .
but the church presents a trickier problem because it clearly shows that churches collaborated with the nazis more than is commonly acknowledged .
initially , the catholic church cooperated with hitler after pope pius xi signed a treaty with him in 1933 .
but that collapsed in 1937 when hitler began putting catholic clergy on trial after the pontiff issued a statement of concern because of years of nazi interference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tower needs to be structurally stabilized meanwhile , hitler appointed ludwig müller as the reich 's bishop to lead a movement of protestant national socialists called the “ german christians , ” also known as the “ storm troopers of jesus . ”
soon after , hitler tried to force protestant churches to join the reich 's protestant church , which promoted an “ aryan jesus ” and wanted to replace the bible with " mein kampf . "
neither the protestant or the catholic church officially opposed the nazi policies towards jews .
brave clergy as parishioners were increasingly turning towards national socialism , some church officials gave in so that they could keep their churches intact and help others such as members of the confessional church , organized by dissident protestant clergy .
“ they preached inner resistance and said that was better than being jailed , ” said klein .
“ some people were even braver . ”
people such as pastor max kurzreiter of the martin luther memorial church who helped people being persecuted by the nazis . he married the writer jochen klepper and his jewish wife johanna in the church in 1938 - something that was illegal at the time .
klepper , his wife and daughter killed themselves in 1942 rather than face deportation .
their story is among those documented and on display for visitors to this unique church . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to allow opening of huge holocaust archive germany agreed tuesday to support opening a massive trove of world war ii records on 17.5 million victims of the nazi regime , after six decades of highly restricted access .

" " the recent statements are a warning sign and should open the eyes of european politicians , " he added . austrian economics minister martin bartenstein said thursday it was high time the eu considered the options . " the message is that the eu would do well to look for alternative pipeline projects , " he said . nonetheless , gazprom and german energy company e.on are continuiung to negotiate the latter 's stake in the yuzhno russkoye gas field in western siberia . politicizing gas supply issues gazprom has risked rekindling tensions that first surfaced in january after the state-run company tightened its taps in a price row with neighboring ukraine , also cutting supplies to some european union countries . bildunterschrift : time to look for new supply routes ?
in a statement on its website , gazprom said it had warned the 25-nation eu not to politicize gas supply issues , threatening to sell fuel elsewhere if its commercial ambitions in the european market were unfairly restricted . " it needs to be noted that attempts to limit gazprom 's activity in the european market and to politicize gas issues , which are in fact solely economic , will not produce good results , " it said . satisfying demand the statement came after gazprom chief alexei miller held what it described as a " frank and objective conversation " in moscow with ambassadors of the 25 eu countries on tuesday , telling them gazprom was " able to satisfy reliably growing gas demand in europe . " " nevertheless , one can not forget that we are actively developing new markets such as north america and china , " he added . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , called on gazprom to stick to its commitments and not to threaten crucial european energy supplies . " the commission expects all suppliers to meet their commercial commitments , " said a commission spokesman .
" in a market that is becoming more and more global , companies are looking for diversification - of suppliers , of routes , " he said , but added : " this diversification should not be used ... to achieve other goals . " changes to law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasingly , the energy question is topping political agendas miller 's meeting with the eu envoys came after the financial times reported unease in britain over news the government there had considered changing the law in order to block a potential takeover by gazprom of british gas supplier centrica . the gazprom statement was a clear warning that europe , which itself has cautioned russia against using its vast energy resources as a " political weapon , " was not the company 's only customer and that it would not react kindly to being blocked from competing in europe 's energy market . " we just want european countries to understand that we have other alternatives in terms of gas sales , " gazprom spokesman sergei kupriyanov told the ft .
" if the european union wants our gas , it has to consider our interests as well . " a gazprom source told afp that the company was concerned about discussion in brussels and other eu capitals about the possibility of applying eu anti-monopoly legislation to gazprom to loosen its control over the sprawling gas pipeline network in russia and other parts of the ex-soviet union . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oil and energy top g8 meeting in moscow finance ministers of the group of eight economically-powerful countries gather in moscow friday for two days of talks likely to focus on russia 's swelling clout in world oil and gas markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.04.2006 germans told to pick their asparagus themselves großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to eat it , but they 'd rather not pick it germans love their asparagus , but they tend to leave the picking to the poles .
but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job . violetta and jan gros live in a remote village in swietokrzyskie province , some 200 kilometers south of the polish capital .
there 's little work to be found in this largely untouched corner of the earth , and come spring , the two farm workers pack their bags and head to germany to join some 300,000 other poles in the country for the annual asparagus harvest . " the region we live in is a very poor , rural area , " explained violetta .
" there are no businesses or factories here , and anyone who can speak a smattering of german ups it and leaves .
there 's practically nothing to do here . " no option the couple are both in their mid-forties and have been unemployed for years .
the polish state provides little in the way of support , and it 's up to them to make ends meet . " i 'm actually a butcher and i worked for the same company for several years , " said jan .
" but then it went bankrupt .
my wife and i own three hectares of land but it 's not enough to live off .
i used to go to work and she took care of the farm , but as soon as i lost my job , times got tough . " in such tight circumstances , jan soon realized his only option was to leave the country . " my cousin had a friend in munich who helped me get work picking asparagus , " he explained .
" for the first three years i went by myself , then i started to take my wife with me . " leaving the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual aspargus harvest attracts thousands of poles every year jan and violetta earn 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.17 -rrb- an hour picking asparagus in bavaria during the two-month season .
they 've never had problems getting paid on time , but despite taking home good money , they 're well aware there must be easier ways of feeding a family of five . " the early days were the hardest , " said violetta .
" having to leave home to go to work in a foreign country with foreign people was very painful .
we did n't speak a word of german .
it was unbearable .
but i 'm adaptable and i learn fast .
and i knew my children would be well looked after with my parents . " three generations of the gros family share the small house in swietokrzyskie .
but the grandparents are getting older , and can no longer be relied upon to help out . " my mother has always been very supportive , but she 's increasingly unwell , " said violetta .
" when she 's not up to the work on the farm then the neighbor gives her a hand , and when we come back then we help him .
everyone helps each other . " upping the ante but this year , jan and violetta might find themselves stuck at home .
their yearly trip over the border with some thirty other locals currently hangs in the balance due to a new german law which rules that only 80 to 90 percent of last year 's foreign seasonal workers can be hired this year , with unemployed germans picking up the slack . the government 's plans , coupled with a new eu directive that requires seasonal workers to pay higher contributions into poland 's social insurance schemes , have left workers in poland who rely on the annual asparagus harvest concerned they 're about to lose out on this vital source of income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles ' jobs are now in the balance " you have to buy food in germany for the two months that you 're there and the cost of living is very high there , " explained violetta .
" many of our friends wo n't be going , because it 's no longer worth it .
but we hope that we 'll still be able to make a profit and after all , we do n't have anything to lose . " but ultimately , the couple are confident there 's still room for them in germany 's asparagus fields . " it 's been tried before , " pointed out jan .
" the job agency sends along some kids and they only ever last a few hours .
and if the poles do n't do the work , the slovaks will .

but now , a new law encouraging germany 's long-term unemployed to find work has left the east europeans out of a job . violetta and jan gros live in a remote village in swietokrzyskie province , some 200 kilometers south of the polish capital .
there 's little work to be found in this largely untouched corner of the earth , and come spring , the two farm workers pack their bags and head to germany to join some 300,000 other poles in the country for the annual asparagus harvest . " the region we live in is a very poor , rural area , " explained violetta .
" there are no businesses or factories here , and anyone who can speak a smattering of german ups it and leaves .
there 's practically nothing to do here . " no option the couple are both in their mid-forties and have been unemployed for years .
the polish state provides little in the way of support , and it 's up to them to make ends meet . " i 'm actually a butcher and i worked for the same company for several years , " said jan .
" but then it went bankrupt .
my wife and i own three hectares of land but it 's not enough to live off .
i used to go to work and she took care of the farm , but as soon as i lost my job , times got tough . " in such tight circumstances , jan soon realized his only option was to leave the country . " my cousin had a friend in munich who helped me get work picking asparagus , " he explained .
" for the first three years i went by myself , then i started to take my wife with me . " leaving the family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual aspargus harvest attracts thousands of poles every year jan and violetta earn 5 euros -lrb- $ 6.17 -rrb- an hour picking asparagus in bavaria during the two-month season .
they 've never had problems getting paid on time , but despite taking home good money , they 're well aware there must be easier ways of feeding a family of five . " the early days were the hardest , " said violetta .
" having to leave home to go to work in a foreign country with foreign people was very painful .
we did n't speak a word of german .
it was unbearable .
but i 'm adaptable and i learn fast .
and i knew my children would be well looked after with my parents . " three generations of the gros family share the small house in swietokrzyskie .
but the grandparents are getting older , and can no longer be relied upon to help out . " my mother has always been very supportive , but she 's increasingly unwell , " said violetta .
" when she 's not up to the work on the farm then the neighbor gives her a hand , and when we come back then we help him .
everyone helps each other . " upping the ante but this year , jan and violetta might find themselves stuck at home .
their yearly trip over the border with some thirty other locals currently hangs in the balance due to a new german law which rules that only 80 to 90 percent of last year 's foreign seasonal workers can be hired this year , with unemployed germans picking up the slack . the government 's plans , coupled with a new eu directive that requires seasonal workers to pay higher contributions into poland 's social insurance schemes , have left workers in poland who rely on the annual asparagus harvest concerned they 're about to lose out on this vital source of income . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poles ' jobs are now in the balance " you have to buy food in germany for the two months that you 're there and the cost of living is very high there , " explained violetta .
" many of our friends wo n't be going , because it 's no longer worth it .
but we hope that we 'll still be able to make a profit and after all , we do n't have anything to lose . " but ultimately , the couple are confident there 's still room for them in germany 's asparagus fields . " it 's been tried before , " pointed out jan .

"
as the sun comes out and germany 's multitude of beer gardens begin opening for the spring and summer season , the society against dishonest pouring is out making sure that punters are n't being short-changed at the tap . there is only one way millions of germans get true summer refreshment , and it comes in the form of a freshly tapped glass of beer . and just as every king needs the perfect crown , germans know every beer requires a perfect frothy head on top .
but they 're still stingy about trading too much potential beer space for the sudsy spray , and have clearly marked every glass with a line to make sure they 're getting their euros ' worth of golden liquid . alas , when patrons start tipping back their fourth , fifth or sixth glass , some bar proprietors try to take them for a ride .
but that 's when the society against dishonest pouring steps in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheers to full beers !
" badly poured beers are among the largest problems in beer gardens , restaurants and at the oktoberfest , " the society wrote on its web site . the sadp estimates that being poured a finger 's width less of lager costs patrons 4.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.2 million -rrb- worth of beer at munich 's annual oktoberfest alone . how to perform the index finger text in case further proof of how seriously germans take their beer - remember , there is a near-holy law dictating exactly what can go into a bottle of brew - the sadp started putting beer pouring technique under the microscope back in 1899 . the society 's web site even offers tips on how to judge whether a beer is poorly poured : after the server brings your drink , wait a moment for the head and beer to settle .

a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money . in the past , the german government has focused on women in its attempt to raise the country 's birth rate .
yet german women are having fewer children than ever before .
overall , german women have an average of 1.37 children , compared wiht 1.75 in sweden and 1.74 in the uk . in surveys , many women say that finding the right father , as well as career pressures , keeps motherhood at bay .
the government has been working on ways to make motherhood more attractive to women , for example , by improving the country 's daycare offerings .
but the state is also training its sights on the men , with monetary incentives for fathers to trade their desks for the diaper-changing table .
the law proposed by the coalition government of cdu and spd calls for wage-based parenting subsidies .
starting in 2007 , parents would receive 67 percent of their net incomes , up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,221 -rrb- a month , to stay at home for the first year of their child 's life .
a stipulation to the proposal made by family affairs minister ursula von der leyen would require the father to spend at least two of the 12 months at home .
otherwise the last two months of funding would be withheld . paying mr. mom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen thinks fathers should help raise the kids opposition parties and women 's groups - while showing wide acceptance for the income-based scheme - have pointed out that a lack of child care for children under age three in germany may lead to a child-care gap for parents after the 12 months are up .
but von der leyen has received criticism from within her own christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for the " papa proposal . " " it is not the government 's place to tell families how to raise their children , " thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the leipziger zeitung . " what is important is that more children are born , not who is doing the dishes , " said saxony 's premier georg milbradt . but volker baisch , father and president of väter e.v. , an organization in hamburg that advises fathers , disagrees .
he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .
since 1998 , german law has given them that option .
but only 5 percent of the fathers actually end up pushing baby carriages full time .
would more money really help ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's changing father figure in sweden , where the two-month " papa " model proposed by minister von der leyen has been in effect for decades , more than 18 percent of fathers stay home for some length of time .
volker baisch of vater e.v. believes that the new law could mean a 10 percent increase in active fathers .
but money is not the only issue keeping men at work . " men are worried about broaching the topic with their bosses , " baisch said .
" but the fact is that men who spend time at home with their kids are good for business as well . " studies have shown that part-time employees are more effective , less likely to take off sick , and generally more satisfied with their jobs .
their partners are happier too , because they are sharing the work at home . " it is a win-win situation , both for the families and for their employers , " baisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising kids is a family affair sparking a mental change but changing germany 's father figure from full time bread-winner to part-time bread baker is a long road .
volker baisch is afraid that the heated discussion around the two-month paternity leave may have given it a bad rap among business owners - and fathers-to-be - before it has even hit the ground . but the father of two is still convinced that the new legislation will get more dads out to the local playground .

but the last surviving nazi-era church in germany is also a place where pastors preached from pulpits adorned with aryans , and babies were baptised in a font featuring carvings of a nazi storm trooper .
in fact , the national socialist link is clear from the outset .
in the lobby , an iron cross chandelier illuminates the busts of martin luther and field marshall paul von hindenburg , germany 's famous world war i commander .
church officials believe that there was initially a likeness of adolf hitler - after whom the church was supposed to be named .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swastikas have been removed in the main part of the church , stained glass windows framed by a stone arch face pews for 800 worshipers and a giant organ .
the organ was first used at national socialist rallies in nuremberg in 1935 - the year the church was opened and two years after hitler came to power .
the huge stone archway has friezes on its square panels .
images of crosses and other religious symbols are next to those of workers , soldiers , eagles and some blank panels - the swastikas were removed because they are illegal in germany .
the altar features a jesus that could have been a body builder . " everything is about power , strength and victory , " said ilse klein , a historian who works at the church .
“ they are clearly fascist symbols . ” saving their church the church was originally designed in 1928 before the nazis seized power .
it was in continuous use until two years ago , when the stability of the tower was threatened and tiles began falling off .
the parish has been lobbying the government of berlin and the protestant church organizations for the 3.5 million euros they need to rebuild .
but there are hundreds of churches in germany in need of money and the city of berlin is practically broke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis tried to force churches to take on their ideology as a result , the parish leaders hope to get historical designation from the city so that they can then apply for funds set aside for historical landmarks from foundations .
and though they don ’ t plan to use the church again for regular services , they hope to hold special ceremonies , concerts and exhibitions marking anniversaries such as the liberation of auschwitz concentration camp on jan .
27 , 1945 . “ it was the times , ” said klein .
“ but it is not common anymore to see politics illustrated inside of a church so clearly .
that is why we want to save it - to remind people this should never happen again . ”
storm troopers of jesus many nazi-era buildings have been preserved and are still in use today . berlin 's olympic stadium , for example , was designed by hitler ’ s favorite architect , albert speer in 1936 , and the nazi ’ s central bank is now used by the foreign ministry .
but the church presents a trickier problem because it clearly shows that churches collaborated with the nazis more than is commonly acknowledged .
initially , the catholic church cooperated with hitler after pope pius xi signed a treaty with him in 1933 .
but that collapsed in 1937 when hitler began putting catholic clergy on trial after the pontiff issued a statement of concern because of years of nazi interference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tower needs to be structurally stabilized meanwhile , hitler appointed ludwig müller as the reich 's bishop to lead a movement of protestant national socialists called the “ german christians , ” also known as the “ storm troopers of jesus . ”
soon after , hitler tried to force protestant churches to join the reich 's protestant church , which promoted an “ aryan jesus ” and wanted to replace the bible with " mein kampf . "
neither the protestant or the catholic church officially opposed the nazi policies towards jews .
brave clergy as parishioners were increasingly turning towards national socialism , some church officials gave in so that they could keep their churches intact and help others such as members of the confessional church , organized by dissident protestant clergy .
“ they preached inner resistance and said that was better than being jailed , ” said klein .
“ some people were even braver . ”
people such as pastor max kurzreiter of the martin luther memorial church who helped people being persecuted by the nazis . he married the writer jochen klepper and his jewish wife johanna in the church in 1938 - something that was illegal at the time .
klepper , his wife and daughter killed themselves in 1942 rather than face deportation .

a new child care bill would give fathers an extra incentive to stay home : money . in the past , the german government has focused on women in its attempt to raise the country 's birth rate .
yet german women are having fewer children than ever before .
overall , german women have an average of 1.37 children , compared wiht 1.75 in sweden and 1.74 in the uk . in surveys , many women say that finding the right father , as well as career pressures , keeps motherhood at bay .
the government has been working on ways to make motherhood more attractive to women , for example , by improving the country 's daycare offerings .
but the state is also training its sights on the men , with monetary incentives for fathers to trade their desks for the diaper-changing table .
the law proposed by the coalition government of cdu and spd calls for wage-based parenting subsidies .
starting in 2007 , parents would receive 67 percent of their net incomes , up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,221 -rrb- a month , to stay at home for the first year of their child 's life .
a stipulation to the proposal made by family affairs minister ursula von der leyen would require the father to spend at least two of the 12 months at home .
otherwise the last two months of funding would be withheld . paying mr. mom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family minister ursula von der leyen thinks fathers should help raise the kids opposition parties and women 's groups - while showing wide acceptance for the income-based scheme - have pointed out that a lack of child care for children under age three in germany may lead to a child-care gap for parents after the 12 months are up .
but von der leyen has received criticism from within her own christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- for the " papa proposal . " " it is not the government 's place to tell families how to raise their children , " thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the leipziger zeitung . " what is important is that more children are born , not who is doing the dishes , " said saxony 's premier georg milbradt . but volker baisch , father and president of väter e.v. , an organization in hamburg that advises fathers , disagrees .
he says that the new law will open up options for young men to take their new role as fathers seriously . " most of the men who come to us want to take parenting leave , but they are n't sure if they can afford it , " baisch told dw-world.de.
" the new law will provide the necessary financial stability , regardless of which of the parents earns more .
and it will also give men an argument that even conservative bosses will understand - they do n't want to lose the money . " " working fathers " help build business in surveys among german men , more than 50 percent said they would like to reduce their workload for more family time .
since 1998 , german law has given them that option .
but only 5 percent of the fathers actually end up pushing baby carriages full time .
would more money really help ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's changing father figure in sweden , where the two-month " papa " model proposed by minister von der leyen has been in effect for decades , more than 18 percent of fathers stay home for some length of time .
volker baisch of vater e.v. believes that the new law could mean a 10 percent increase in active fathers .
but money is not the only issue keeping men at work . " men are worried about broaching the topic with their bosses , " baisch said .
" but the fact is that men who spend time at home with their kids are good for business as well . " studies have shown that part-time employees are more effective , less likely to take off sick , and generally more satisfied with their jobs .
their partners are happier too , because they are sharing the work at home . " it is a win-win situation , both for the families and for their employers , " baisch said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raising kids is a family affair sparking a mental change but changing germany 's father figure from full time bread-winner to part-time bread baker is a long road .
volker baisch is afraid that the heated discussion around the two-month paternity leave may have given it a bad rap among business owners - and fathers-to-be - before it has even hit the ground . but the father of two is still convinced that the new legislation will get more dads out to the local playground .

first minister rhodri morgan and welsh secretary peter hain have backed plans for a barrage over the bristol channel .
the consortium behind one proposal says its 10-mile project would bring as much energy as three nuclear power stations .
environmental groups fear a barrage over the estuary would destroy a unique and world-famous eco-system .
the severn has a tidal range approaching 14m , the second highest in the world .
the severn tidal power group -lrb- stpg -rrb- , a joint venture between six power engineering and construction firms , estimates this can be harnessed to generate up to 6 % of the electricity for england and wales .
the group is proposing a barrage across the estuary from lavernock point , near cardiff , to brean down in somerset .
the scheme is different from one put to councillors in somerset on 1 march by a neath businessman .
the welsh assembly government has now decided to submit its recommendations on the idea of a severn barrage to the uk government 's energy review next tuesday .
both mr morgan and mr hain have said they see a barrage across the severn as one solution to the uk 's energy crisis .
ecology roger hull , of the severn tidal power group , said the barrage would take six years to build and could be generating power as early as 2017 .
he said : " it 's a proven technology .
this is a big application because , of course , if you want to generate a lot of electricity , you need a big project to do so .
" it 's definitely a good way of producing this predictable , renewable power that does not produce any carbon dioxide at all .
so it 's very climate friendly . "
a tidal barrage has operated at la rance , near st malo in brittany , since 1967 .
but environmentalists claim a severn barrage would adversely affect the ecology of the estuary , even ending the severn bore .
tim stowe , of rspb cymru , said the 80,000 waterfowl - including dunlin and redshank - which the society estimates use the estuary as their winter feeding grounds would have to go elsewhere or perish .
he said : " the impact can only be negative on the birds that use it .
once you have built it , you can not take it away . "

first minister rhodri morgan and welsh secretary peter hain have backed plans for a barrage over the bristol channel .
the consortium behind one proposal says its 10-mile project would bring as much energy as three nuclear power stations .
environmental groups fear a barrage over the estuary would destroy a unique and world-famous eco-system .
the severn has a tidal range approaching 14m , the second highest in the world .
a tidal barrage has operated near st malo in france for decades the severn tidal power group -lrb- stpg -rrb- , a joint venture between six power engineering and construction firms , estimates this can be harnessed to generate up to 6 % of the electricity for england and wales .
the group is proposing a barrage across the estuary from lavernock point , near cardiff , to brean down in somerset .
the scheme is different from one put to councillors in somerset on 1 march by a neath businessman .
the welsh assembly government has now decided to submit its recommendations on the idea of a severn barrage to the uk government 's energy review next tuesday .
both mr morgan and mr hain have said they see a barrage across the severn as one solution to the uk 's energy crisis .
ecology roger hull , of the severn tidal power group , said the barrage would take six years to build and could be generating power as early as 2017 .
the tide would drive turbines like this one at la rance , france he said : " it 's a proven technology .
this is a big application because , of course , if you want to generate a lot of electricity , you need a big project to do so .
" it 's definitely a good way of producing this predictable , renewable power that does not produce any carbon dioxide at all .
so it 's very climate friendly . "
a tidal barrage has operated at la rance , near st malo in brittany , since 1967 .
but environmentalists claim a severn barrage would adversely affect the ecology of the estuary , even ending the severn bore .
tim stowe , of rspb cymru , said the 80,000 waterfowl - including dunlin and redshank - which the society estimates use the estuary as their winter feeding grounds would have to go elsewhere or perish .
he said : " the impact can only be negative on the birds that use it .

the group from wrexham will travel to real madrid football club to raise money for the wales air ambulance .
bikers simon " evzie " eve , mark " smudge " smith , ray grice and carl dodd all work at scott 's nightclub .
mr eve said : " the air ambulance is forever helping bikers , we thought - why ca n't bikers help the ambulance ? "
" we did a run to paris and back last year in 24 hours for a bit of a jolly , and because we did paris and back , we thought we would do somewhere a little bit further for charity , so we set ourselves madrid , " mr eve explained .
there are not many people who would embark on such an arduous journey for charity anna evans wales air ambulance although they will be visiting real madrid 's home , mr eve said he would not describe them as " avid " followers of football .
" we 're rugby players , just doormen from the club , who decided to help the air ambulance . "
the charity says the air ambulance is very important to the large rural population of wales , as it can quickly reach areas that are difficult or even impossible to reach by road .
the cost of providing wales with a full air ambulance service is £ 2m a year , which is met entirely by donations .
although the bikers aim to raise money , mr eve said they were more concerned with raising the public 's awareness .
" we were asked in the early stages how much we are aiming to raise , but the cash is just a bonus .
" the air ambulance gets no cash from the government , we just want more people to be aware of it . "
' arduous journey ' wales air ambulance fundraiser anna evans said the ride was " really special " .
" there are not many people who would embark on such an arduous journey for charity , so the lads who are doing this for us really deserve all the support they can get . "
the four will leave wrexham at 1900 bst on friday , and head south for the channel tunnel .
they will travel through france , across the pyrenees , and through central spain to madrid .
all are confident they will be back in time for their welcome home party two days later , which is being held at the nightclub where they work .

obstetrician professor andrew shennan said early delivery can lead to physical and mental health problems , the british medical journal said .
a recent denmark study said the preterm rate had risen by a fifth in 10 years .
professor shennan said doctors and parents should look to see if the number of preterm births can be cut .
the danish research published by the bmj in february found preterm deliveries had increased by 22 % from 1995 to 2004 . "
if these findings from denmark are true , the implications for neonatologists , health economists , teachers , parents , and children themselves are worrying " professor andrew shennan , of king 's college london it suggested fertility treatment , multiple pregnancies and elective deliveries were partly to blame for the trend .
but researchers also said factors such as smoking , teenage and middle-age pregnancy , obesity and social inequalities could also play a role .
recent trends indicate the number of preterm babies are on the increase in england and wales .
in 2004 , 42,500 preterm deliveries were made , up by 2,500 from the year before .
preterm deliveries account for fewer than 1 in 10 births , but result in three quarters of neonatal deaths and most neonatal intensive care admissions .
for instance , one in four survivors born less than 25 weeks ' gestation have severe mental or physical disability .
even beyond 32 weeks , one in three children have educational and behavioural problems by the age of seven .
professor shennan , from king 's college london , added : " obstetricians should re-evaluate the risks and benefits of delivering babies earlier .
' worrying ' " if these findings from denmark are true , the implications for neonatologists , health economists , teachers , parents , and children themselves are worrying .
" other countries need to ensure that mechanisms are in place to detect such trends and assess their impact . "
and he added if the burden on health was to be reduced , the number of preterm babies needed to reduced where possible , although he said identifying the underlying causes was difficult .
but a spokeswoman for premature baby charity bliss said : " one of the main reasons we are seeing a rise in premature births is because of the improving medical care which means premature babies who would have died 20 years ago are now surviving and are going on to have a good quality of life .
" while this is good news , we need to make sure that the nhs is increasing the resources put into neonatal care to make sure we can cope with the ever increasing demand . "

australian pm john howard said a further 110 soldiers would leave on friday at the request of commanders of the peacekeeping force deployed there .
mr rini has ruled out resigning , despite two days of riots that has left parts of the capital honiara in ruins .
he denies allegations of links to widespread corruption in the past .
the streets of honiara have remained calm despite fears of a resurgence in violence once news of mr rini 's secret swearing-in early on thursday became known .
a dawn-to-dusk curfew , imposed on wednesday to end the rioting , will be reviewed on saturday , solomon islands police commissioner shane castles said .
mr howard said , " the situation is still tense and there 's still the potential for further trouble . "
the extra troops will join almost 450 australian troops and police who , along with new zealand troops , are patrolling the streets of the south pacific nation .
australian foreign minister alexander downer is due to visit the solomon islands on saturday to hold talks with the new prime minister .
no-confidence vote announcing his new cabinet , mr rini , 56 , insisted he would not bow to pressure to step down .
" i was elected through a democratic process and according to the country 's constitution , " he was quoted by the associated press as saying .
riots highlight china tensions he also insisted he would beat any no-confidence vote put forward when parliament meets next week .
mr rini , the former deputy prime minister , is accused of being too closely linked to former prime minister allan kemakeza 's administration , which was tainted by corruption allegations .
demonstrators also accuse him of using money from chinese and taiwanese backers to bribe mps into voting for him .
he has angrily denied the claims , saying : " i would like to challenge those who make these allegations , to take them to the police " .
chinese flee hundreds of people took to the streets of honiara after mr rini was chosen for the premiership in a ballot by 50 newly-elected mps on tuesday .
much of honiara 's chinatown area was razed in the rioting , during which some families were forced to jump from burning buildings .
it could take up to five years for the city to be rebuilt , government spokesman johnson honimae told reuters news agency .
" a good chunk of the government 's revenue comes from the businesses that have been destroyed , " he said .
dozens of chinese families fled their homes and are now being cared for by the local red cross .
china is flying in diplomats to arrange shelter for some 500 nationals , an official spokesman in beijing said .
the violence took many surprise .
security in the solomons archipelago had improved since the australian-led mission arrived in 2003 , after years of tribal violence had resulted in the breakdown of law and order .
the conflict - between indigenous residents of the main island of guadalcanal and settlers from the island of malaita - was fought over land rights and jobs .

australian pm john howard said a further 110 soldiers would leave on friday at the request of commanders of the peacekeeping force deployed there .
mr rini has ruled out resigning , despite two days of riots that has left parts of the capital honiara in ruins .
he denies allegations of links to widespread corruption in the past .
the streets of honiara have remained calm despite fears of a resurgence in violence once news of mr rini 's secret swearing-in early on thursday became known .
a dawn-to-dusk curfew , imposed on wednesday to end the rioting , will be reviewed on saturday , solomon islands police commissioner shane castles said .
mr howard said , " the situation is still tense and there 's still the potential for further trouble . "
the extra troops will join almost 450 australian troops and police who , along with new zealand troops , are patrolling the streets of the south pacific nation .
australian foreign minister alexander downer is due to visit the solomon islands on saturday to hold talks with the new prime minister .
no-confidence vote announcing his new cabinet , mr rini , 56 , insisted he would not bow to pressure to step down .
" i was elected through a democratic process and according to the country 's constitution , " he was quoted by the associated press as saying .
riots highlight china tensions he also insisted he would beat any no-confidence vote put forward when parliament meets next week .
mr rini , the former deputy prime minister , is accused of being too closely linked to former prime minister allan kemakeza 's administration , which was tainted by corruption allegations .
demonstrators also accuse him of using money from chinese and taiwanese backers to bribe mps into voting for him .
he has angrily denied the claims , saying : " i would like to challenge those who make these allegations , to take them to the police " .
chinese flee hundreds of people took to the streets of honiara after mr rini was chosen for the premiership in a ballot by 50 newly-elected mps on tuesday .
much of honiara 's chinatown area was razed in the rioting , during which some families were forced to jump from burning buildings .
mr rini had to be sworn in unannounced following the protests it could take up to five years for the city to be rebuilt , government spokesman johnson honimae told reuters news agency .
" a good chunk of the government 's revenue comes from the businesses that have been destroyed , " he said .
dozens of chinese families fled their homes and are now being cared for by the local red cross .
china is flying in diplomats to arrange shelter for some 500 nationals , an official spokesman in beijing said .
the violence took many surprise .
security in the solomons archipelago had improved since the australian-led mission arrived in 2003 , after years of tribal violence had resulted in the breakdown of law and order .
the conflict - between indigenous residents of the main island of guadalcanal and settlers from the island of malaita - was fought over land rights and jobs .
