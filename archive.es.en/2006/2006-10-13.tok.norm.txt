it is not run by a church or foundation but by a company that views education as a product and unabashedly wants to profit from it . at first glance , the colorful and bright classrooms of the new phorms elementary school berlin-mitte just north of downtown berlin seems like any other , complete with tables and chairs , drawings and games and books . but a closer look at this spanking new elementary school in an old factory reveals distinctions : take the fact that there are fewer chairs for students , meaning the class sizes are smaller than in state schools - or the latest technology hanging on the walls , such as a " smart " blackboard that operates by computer . the most unusual differences , however , lie in the concept and management of the school : it is owned and run by a private company that offers shares , has a chief executive officer , a chief financial officer and a board of directors with a wealth of business experience .
it aims to turn a profit with its product education . national heresy ? it certainly seems like heresy in a country like germany in which even a university education is free .
when politicians wanting to shake up the country 's languishing education system proposed " elite " universities and tuition a few years ago , there was an uproar . still , private elementary and secondary schools in germany are not new even as the concept for paying for schooling is for most germans .
mostly , private schools in the past decades catered to the thousands of expatriate families , serving in the military or working in companies in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bea beste says that education is a product more recently , things are changing in the german educational landscape .
parents are inundated with studies such as the pisa one by the organization for economic development and cooperation laying out the deficiencies of the public school system - the german school system ranked near the bottom compared to its neighbors .
still , that is n't telling german parents anything they have n't already known for years , said phorms ceo bea beste . as a result , it is n't surprising that the number of students in germany attending private schools has jumped about 30 percent in the past decade , according government statistics - more than 600,000 youngsters eschewed public school in 2005 . that is something phorms is set on capitalizing on . " let 's conceive our product and establish it as a brand in germany , " said bea beste , ceo of the management company and a consultant in marketing and branding .
" the idea is to take a look at the weaknesses of the german system and offer an alternative .
our concept is n't to make a lot of money but to offer a quality product through playing by the rules of business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cfo johannes nagel expects profits in one year phorms cfo johannes nagel said that the berlin school itself - which has about 50 students in grades 1 to 5 - will turn a profit by the end of the school year .
the company is expected to be able to pay dividends in about six years .
and meanwhile , schools in munich , hamburg , frankfurt and possibly düsseldorf are planned for next year .
in 2008 , the company wants to open another five to eight schools . " education is a product that people are willing to pay for , " he said .
" we are confident that this will work . " desperate for solutions beste , one of the original founders of the school , said that the name phorms is a combination of the german word for form and metamorphosis .
this is the idea behind the company 's educational concept , she said : helping children to learn and grow . the school wants to do this by offering a language immersion program with students learning in both german and english .
it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .
and students are a diverse group with about 40 percent coming from german families and the rest either of mixed nationalities or foreign residents . what seems to most impress parents is the school 's individual focus and nurturing environment for children , enticing them to pay the sliding scale tuition that ranges from 200 to 800 euros -lrb- $ 250 to $ 1,000 -rrb- per month , based on family income . " i was desperate to find a school for my son and i did n't care what it was going to cost , " said lisa kay c. smith , an american resident whose 9-year-old son , david , attended german public school for two years .
" there was an unacceptable level of violence in the state schools and the school officials would n't deal with it .
at phorms , they take the attitude that it takes a village to raise a child and deal with issues and the child as an individual . " unethical profits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children helped prepare their own playground such opinions do n't impress the school 's critics such as josef kraus , head of the german teacher 's union . " it is unethical to profit on the backs of children , " he told der spiegel magazine . but betrand freiesleben , whose 6-year-old son , friedrich , attends the school , said he thinks differently .
he chose the school for its bilingual education , innovative and open approach and small classes .
and he said that he wants to give the school time before passing judgement . " there are some who say , ' how dare you earn money off children , " ' he said .
" but there is nothing bad about this as long as it is not the main interest .
and as far as i can tell , it is not .

" it is great happiness for us all that a turkish writer has won such a prestigious award , " foreign minister abdullah gül told reporters at a joint press conference with his visiting afghan counterpart rangin dadfar spanta . in an apparent reference to the controversies pamuk has stirred up , gul said : " many day-to-day things are soon forgotten but the fact that a turkish writer has won the nobel award will echo throughout the world ...
it is great publicity for turkey . " " this is a historic day , " said metin celal , chairman of the turkish publishers ' union , forecasting that pamuk 's success would put turkish literature firmly on the world map . author delighted with prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was congratulated by the turkish government france , germany and the european commission also hailed the news , while pamuk himself said he was delighted . " it 's such a great honor , such a great pleasure , " pamuk told journalists at columbia university in new york .
" i think that this is first of all an honor bestowed upon the turkish language , turkish culture , turkey and also recognition of my labors ... my humble devotion to that great art of the novel . " turkey 's congratulations came despite bad blood between the establishment and the 54-year-old author , who has challenged official policies and rejected the accolade of " state artist " . the timing of the award was ironic . just hours before the swedish academy announced the award , the french parliament approved a bill making it an offense punishable by prison to deny that the ottoman turks committed genocide against armenians during world war i. pamuk himself was put on trial earlier this year for challenging the official line on the massacres , which turkey denies were genocide . pamuk praised by those who once damned him bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac was said to be delighted for pamuk french president jacques chirac said he was " delighted " that pamuk had won the nobel literature prize .
chirac said he was " particularly delighted " saying pamuk 's " reflection on society is ... intelligent , strong and liberal " . the case against pamuk was dropped on a technicality but not before a provincial official ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books .
ankara swiftly stopped the move , wary of undermining its democratic credentials in european union eyes . in brussels eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the award a victory for " artistic freedom and for freedom of expression . " a prize for freedom of speech " it is good news for all those who want to speak , search , learn the truth , pursue dialogue , exchange thoughts and knowledge - not just in turkey but everywhere else , " the finnish commissioner said .
" artists ... need freedom of expression as desperately as life needs water and air .
orhan knows more than others how precious and fragile such freedom is . " rehn recalled pamuk telling him during his legal woes he just wanted to " write books again and free my mind from all this harassment . " pamuk 's novels , which include " snow " and " my name is red , " regularly tackle turkey 's decades-old internal struggle between islam and secularism . " in his home country , pamuk has a reputation as a social commentator even though he sees himself principally as a fiction writer with no political agenda , " the nobel jury commented . " a builder of bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier acknowledged pamuk 's cultural influence in germany , whose 2.5-million-strong turkish community is the biggest outside turkey itself , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hailed pamuk as a " builder of bridges . " he is a symbol for the wish of large parts of turkish society to become a part of europe , " said steinmeier , who supports turkey 's bid to join the eu . pamuk 's editor in france , jean mattern , said the nobel panel had rewarded " the quality of his writing and the force of his message . " his work has always tackled political and historical issues head on , " he told reporters . pamuk 's turkish publisher , iletisim , was also delighted . " we are very happy , " said academic and iletisim editor ahmet insel .
" pamuk is an important representative of the modern novel in the world , " he told ntv . of the writer 's political views , insel said : " if we take a look at the long history of the nobel literature prize , we see that the authors who won the award have made important political statements on the future of their countries and the world .

germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .
the winners are ensured millions in state funds for years .
the losers may face a bleak future . german research and education minister annette schavan announced friday that munich 's ludwig-maximilian university , munich 's technical university -lrb- tu -rrb- and the university of karlsruhe had been named germany 's first " elite universities . "
the three institutions are the biggest winners in germany 's " excellence initiative , " which was established to improve the country 's chronically under-funded colleges - and its reputation abroad - by encouraging high level research and competition .
the trio will receive around 120 million euros -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- each in federal and state funds over the next five years . " so far , no german university has made it into the top 50 worldwide , but if we carry out our concept for the future , after five years we could be among the first 25 , " tu president wolfgang a. herrmann told handelsblatt online portal .
developing excellence in total , 22 projects from universities , mainly in germany 's richest states , were singled out to receive a portion of the 1.9 billion euros earmarked for the initiative between 2007 and 2011 .
the money will be distributed in three areas : for graduate schools that showed they knew how to promote new talent ; for " research clusters " that demonstrated they were centers of excellence in particular fields ; and finally for three top institutions that encompassed all of the previous qualities as well as presenting a dazzling vision of a future of educational excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to resurrect its image as a research leader bavaria , of which munich is the capital , and baden-württemberg , where karlsruhe is located , cleaned up in the competition , with eight of the 18 successful graduate schools and another eight of the 17 recognized research clusters , which are meant to be developed into a small number of internationally recognized research institutes . universities in the country 's north and east went largely unacknowledged in the expert panel 's decisions , causing some to predict they could end up as even bigger losers in the future as ever more funding goes to institutions in the south and west , already among the country 's wealthiest regions . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

german politicians from the left-wing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have proposed a similar initiative . " the victims have to live with the crime for their whole lives and i think it 's fair that the offenders should also have to live with it , " hamburg 's spd leader mathias petersen told bild zeitung daily on thursday . dorothee bär , a csu parliamentarian , also backs the proposal .
" the security of our children should come before data protection , " she said . kristina köhler , bär 's colleague from partner party cdu and member of the bundestag 's interior committee , added that the legal basis of the american model would have to be examined before being implemented in germany . bayreuth murder spurred " black list " proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries has spoken out against the register demands for the internet registry follow the rape and murder of a 39-year-old nurse in bayreuth . the alleged offender had been convicted of rape , kidnapping and extortionate robbery five year earlier .
though he had been sentenced to eight years in prison , he was released in september 2006 . in light of the bayreuth murder , bavarian csu leader joachim herrmann made an appeal this week for a " black list " for errant prisoner evaluators that approve the release of dangerous criminals . however , not all members of the governing coalition support an internet registry for sex offenders . drawbacks to a public registry " publishing names and addresses on the internet takes away the possibility of starting over - even after the offender has already served his time , " justice minister brigitte zypries told afp on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do open files mean privacy violation or crime prevention ?
spd parliamentarian dieter wiefelspütz said that the proposed registry would " open the shooting ground " instead of providing increased security , according to a spiegel online report .
in spring 2006 , the state of maine removed its internet registry after two registered sex offenders on the public list were shot to death . what 's more , the constitutionality of the registry has come into question . peter m. huber , a constitutional lawyer in munich called the proposal " constitutionally highly problematic " and said that sex offenders also had a " right to self-determination of information , " wrote spiegel online . young politicians demand life sentence at the other end of the spectrum members of bavaria 's youth union -lrb- ju -rrb- , a branch of the csu , have suggested that public humiliation is n't harsh enough for sex offenders . the ju advocates life-long sentences for first time sex offenders and preventative detention for violent sex offenders , said ju leader manfred weber . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state of saxony considers public list of sex offenders saxony 's interior minister has called for a public register of sex offenders ' whereabouts after a 13-year old spent five weeks in the clutches of a man convicted for sex crimes who lived in her dresden neighborhood .

" the project would first be introduced in november in five cities in the country 's north , where bremen is located , she said on a television talk show .
starting in 2007 , the project would be expanded to four more of germany 's 16 states .
it was expected to cost 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , she said . the government had already recognized that child neglect was a problem and had set up a working group to tackle it at the beginning of the year , justice minister brigitte zypries said in an interview in the berliner zeitung newspaper on friday .
the experts ' recommendations on how to improve cooperation and communication between all parties were expected to be completed before the end of the year .
billions not millions child protection organization deutsche kinderhilfe direkt welcomed the plan to establish an early warning system but said it was too little and that billions , not millions , of euros were necessary to make a difference .
there are too few care facilities for children in danger of abuse causing the childcare agencies to put off removing them from their families as long as possible , according to the group 's head , georg ehrmann . " developing care facilities costs real money , " he said . the deutsche kinderschutzbund , another child protection organization , said new legislation was n't necessary to protect kids from neglect , but that the existing laws needed to be applied . kevin 's body was found on tuesday .
a family court had ordered that the boy be taken away from his father , a known drug addict prone to violent outbursts , but officials were too late to save him . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a boy 's death shows failure of german child welfare system on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 13.10.2006 german politicians propose internet registry for sex offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians want to publish sex offenders ' names , other want life sentences after a 39-year-old woman was recently raped and murdered in bayreuth by a repeated sex offender , both liberal and conservative politicians have recommended starting an internet registry based on the us model . in the us , the internet-based " national alert registry " allows users to enter their zip code and access a list of registered sex offenders in their area , complete with address and color photo .
german politicians from the left-wing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have proposed a similar initiative . " the victims have to live with the crime for their whole lives and i think it 's fair that the offenders should also have to live with it , " hamburg 's spd leader mathias petersen told bild zeitung daily on thursday . dorothee bär , a csu parliamentarian , also backs the proposal .
" the security of our children should come before data protection , " she said . kristina köhler , bär 's colleague from partner party cdu and member of the bundestag 's interior committee , added that the legal basis of the american model would have to be examined before being implemented in germany . bayreuth murder spurred " black list " proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries has spoken out against the register demands for the internet registry follow the rape and murder of a 39-year-old nurse in bayreuth . the alleged offender had been convicted of rape , kidnapping and extortionate robbery five year earlier .
though he had been sentenced to eight years in prison , he was released in september 2006 . in light of the bayreuth murder , bavarian csu leader joachim herrmann made an appeal this week for a " black list " for errant prisoner evaluators that approve the release of dangerous criminals . however , not all members of the governing coalition support an internet registry for sex offenders . drawbacks to a public registry " publishing names and addresses on the internet takes away the possibility of starting over - even after the offender has already served his time , " justice minister brigitte zypries told afp on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do open files mean privacy violation or crime prevention ?
spd parliamentarian dieter wiefelspütz said that the proposed registry would " open the shooting ground " instead of providing increased security , according to a spiegel online report .
in spring 2006 , the state of maine removed its internet registry after two registered sex offenders on the public list were shot to death . what 's more , the constitutionality of the registry has come into question . peter m. huber , a constitutional lawyer in munich called the proposal " constitutionally highly problematic " and said that sex offenders also had a " right to self-determination of information , " wrote spiegel online . young politicians demand life sentence at the other end of the spectrum members of bavaria 's youth union -lrb- ju -rrb- , a branch of the csu , have suggested that public humiliation is n't harsh enough for sex offenders . the ju advocates life-long sentences for first time sex offenders and preventative detention for violent sex offenders , said ju leader manfred weber . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state of saxony considers public list of sex offenders saxony 's interior minister has called for a public register of sex offenders ' whereabouts after a 13-year old spent five weeks in the clutches of a man convicted for sex crimes who lived in her dresden neighborhood .
-lrb- 28.02.2006 -rrb- france tests " chemical castration " in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward .
-lrb- 08.01.2005 -rrb- preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators .
-lrb- 02.08.2004 -rrb- surveys should germany put a publicly accessible registry of sex offenders on the internet ?
yes , all sex offenders should be listed for life .
yes , but the time the sex offender is listed should correspond to the severity of the crime .
no , the public should not have access to a registry of sex offenders .

germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .
the winners are ensured millions in state funds for years .
the losers may face a bleak future . german research and education minister annette schavan announced friday that munich 's ludwig-maximilian university , munich 's technical university -lrb- tu -rrb- and the university of karlsruhe had been named germany 's first " elite universities . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.10.2006 opinion : abused children are everyone 's problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every member of society is responsible to do what he or she can to prevent tragedies , like that of two-year-old kevin , who was found dead in his father 's freezer this week , from occurring , according to dw 's dirk bathe . no , this time the question is not as it usually is in such cases : how could this happen ?
the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .
that is our responsibility . dirk bathe is a politics editor at dw-radio -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans early warning system to protect children germany 's family minister said an early warning system would go into effect this year to prevent children from being neglected days after the body of two-year-old kevin was found in his father 's freezer in bremen .
-lrb- 13.10.2006 -rrb- a boy 's death shows failure of german child welfare system on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .
the case has horrified germans and caused political fallout , as the child was supposed to be in state custody when he died .
-lrb- 12.10.2006 -rrb- neglected children in the spotlight on international kids ' day international children 's day is an opportunity to consider the hardships - hunger , neglect , sickness , war - faced by millions of children .
even in germany , more children suffer than many people realize .

the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .

it is not run by a church or foundation but by a company that views education as a product and unabashedly wants to profit from it . at first glance , the colorful and bright classrooms of the new phorms elementary school berlin-mitte just north of downtown berlin seems like any other , complete with tables and chairs , drawings and games and books . but a closer look at this spanking new elementary school in an old factory reveals distinctions : take the fact that there are fewer chairs for students , meaning the class sizes are smaller than in state schools - or the latest technology hanging on the walls , such as a " smart " blackboard that operates by computer . the most unusual differences , however , lie in the concept and management of the school : it is owned and run by a private company that offers shares , has a chief executive officer , a chief financial officer and a board of directors with a wealth of business experience .
it aims to turn a profit with its product education . national heresy ? it certainly seems like heresy in a country like germany in which even a university education is free .
when politicians wanting to shake up the country 's languishing education system proposed " elite " universities and tuition a few years ago , there was an uproar . still , private elementary and secondary schools in germany are not new even as the concept for paying for schooling is for most germans .
mostly , private schools in the past decades catered to the thousands of expatriate families , serving in the military or working in companies in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bea beste says that education is a product more recently , things are changing in the german educational landscape .
parents are inundated with studies such as the pisa one by the organization for economic development and cooperation laying out the deficiencies of the public school system - the german school system ranked near the bottom compared to its neighbors .
still , that is n't telling german parents anything they have n't already known for years , said phorms ceo bea beste . as a result , it is n't surprising that the number of students in germany attending private schools has jumped about 30 percent in the past decade , according government statistics - more than 600,000 youngsters eschewed public school in 2005 . that is something phorms is set on capitalizing on . " let 's conceive our product and establish it as a brand in germany , " said bea beste , ceo of the management company and a consultant in marketing and branding .
" the idea is to take a look at the weaknesses of the german system and offer an alternative .
our concept is n't to make a lot of money but to offer a quality product through playing by the rules of business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cfo johannes nagel expects profits in one year phorms cfo johannes nagel said that the berlin school itself - which has about 50 students in grades 1 to 5 - will turn a profit by the end of the school year .
the company is expected to be able to pay dividends in about six years .
and meanwhile , schools in munich , hamburg , frankfurt and possibly düsseldorf are planned for next year .
in 2008 , the company wants to open another five to eight schools . " education is a product that people are willing to pay for , " he said .
" we are confident that this will work . " desperate for solutions beste , one of the original founders of the school , said that the name phorms is a combination of the german word for form and metamorphosis .
this is the idea behind the company 's educational concept , she said : helping children to learn and grow . the school wants to do this by offering a language immersion program with students learning in both german and english .
it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .
and students are a diverse group with about 40 percent coming from german families and the rest either of mixed nationalities or foreign residents . what seems to most impress parents is the school 's individual focus and nurturing environment for children , enticing them to pay the sliding scale tuition that ranges from 200 to 800 euros -lrb- $ 250 to $ 1,000 -rrb- per month , based on family income . " i was desperate to find a school for my son and i did n't care what it was going to cost , " said lisa kay c. smith , an american resident whose 9-year-old son , david , attended german public school for two years .
" there was an unacceptable level of violence in the state schools and the school officials would n't deal with it .
at phorms , they take the attitude that it takes a village to raise a child and deal with issues and the child as an individual . " unethical profits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children helped prepare their own playground such opinions do n't impress the school 's critics such as josef kraus , head of the german teacher 's union . " it is unethical to profit on the backs of children , " he told der spiegel magazine . but betrand freiesleben , whose 6-year-old son , friedrich , attends the school , said he thinks differently .
he chose the school for its bilingual education , innovative and open approach and small classes .
and he said that he wants to give the school time before passing judgement . " there are some who say , ' how dare you earn money off children , " ' he said .
" but there is nothing bad about this as long as it is not the main interest .
and as far as i can tell , it is not .

the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .
that is our responsibility . dirk bathe is a politics editor at dw-radio -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans early warning system to protect children germany 's family minister said an early warning system would go into effect this year to prevent children from being neglected days after the body of two-year-old kevin was found in his father 's freezer in bremen .

the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .

he would n't feel out of place at a current trade fair featuring the latest in security technology . at " security 2006 , " watch where you step .
if you tread on one doormat , you 'll be met with a high-decibel greeting meant to scare intruders away . the screaming mat is one of many new devices on view at the trade show ending friday in essen that aim to prevent theft or espionage - corporate or otherwise - or meet even more serious threats , such as those posed by terrorism . at a stand run by technology firm simons and voss , several entry doors have been set up side-by-side .
they are meant to illustrate the company 's new digital lock system , called " transponder . "
the small coin-sized mechanism can open - and lock again - dozens of doors , cabinets and gates which have been programmed to respond to it , meaning the days of the heavy keychain might be numbered . the device can also be programmed to read biometric data from an individual , meaning only he or she can operate it and only open certain locks .

it is not run by a church or foundation but by a company that views education as a product and unabashedly wants to profit from it . at first glance , the colorful and bright classrooms of the new phorms elementary school berlin-mitte just north of downtown berlin seems like any other , complete with tables and chairs , drawings and games and books . but a closer look at this spanking new elementary school in an old factory reveals distinctions : take the fact that there are fewer chairs for students , meaning the class sizes are smaller than in state schools - or the latest technology hanging on the walls , such as a " smart " blackboard that operates by computer . the most unusual differences , however , lie in the concept and management of the school : it is owned and run by a private company that offers shares , has a chief executive officer , a chief financial officer and a board of directors with a wealth of business experience .
it aims to turn a profit with its product education . national heresy ? it certainly seems like heresy in a country like germany in which even a university education is free .
when politicians wanting to shake up the country 's languishing education system proposed " elite " universities and tuition a few years ago , there was an uproar . still , private elementary and secondary schools in germany are not new even as the concept for paying for schooling is for most germans .
mostly , private schools in the past decades catered to the thousands of expatriate families , serving in the military or working in companies in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bea beste says that education is a product more recently , things are changing in the german educational landscape .
parents are inundated with studies such as the pisa one by the organization for economic development and cooperation laying out the deficiencies of the public school system - the german school system ranked near the bottom compared to its neighbors .
still , that is n't telling german parents anything they have n't already known for years , said phorms ceo bea beste . as a result , it is n't surprising that the number of students in germany attending private schools has jumped about 30 percent in the past decade , according government statistics - more than 600,000 youngsters eschewed public school in 2005 . that is something phorms is set on capitalizing on . " let 's conceive our product and establish it as a brand in germany , " said bea beste , ceo of the management company and a consultant in marketing and branding .
" the idea is to take a look at the weaknesses of the german system and offer an alternative .
our concept is n't to make a lot of money but to offer a quality product through playing by the rules of business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cfo johannes nagel expects profits in one year phorms cfo johannes nagel said that the berlin school itself - which has about 50 students in grades 1 to 5 - will turn a profit by the end of the school year .
the company is expected to be able to pay dividends in about six years .
and meanwhile , schools in munich , hamburg , frankfurt and possibly düsseldorf are planned for next year .
in 2008 , the company wants to open another five to eight schools . " education is a product that people are willing to pay for , " he said .
" we are confident that this will work . " desperate for solutions beste , one of the original founders of the school , said that the name phorms is a combination of the german word for form and metamorphosis .
this is the idea behind the company 's educational concept , she said : helping children to learn and grow . the school wants to do this by offering a language immersion program with students learning in both german and english .
it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .
and students are a diverse group with about 40 percent coming from german families and the rest either of mixed nationalities or foreign residents . what seems to most impress parents is the school 's individual focus and nurturing environment for children , enticing them to pay the sliding scale tuition that ranges from 200 to 800 euros -lrb- $ 250 to $ 1,000 -rrb- per month , based on family income . " i was desperate to find a school for my son and i did n't care what it was going to cost , " said lisa kay c. smith , an american resident whose 9-year-old son , david , attended german public school for two years .
" there was an unacceptable level of violence in the state schools and the school officials would n't deal with it .
at phorms , they take the attitude that it takes a village to raise a child and deal with issues and the child as an individual . " unethical profits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children helped prepare their own playground such opinions do n't impress the school 's critics such as josef kraus , head of the german teacher 's union . " it is unethical to profit on the backs of children , " he told der spiegel magazine . but betrand freiesleben , whose 6-year-old son , friedrich , attends the school , said he thinks differently .
he chose the school for its bilingual education , innovative and open approach and small classes .
and he said that he wants to give the school time before passing judgement . " there are some who say , ' how dare you earn money off children , " ' he said .
" but there is nothing bad about this as long as it is not the main interest .
and as far as i can tell , it is not .

it is not run by a church or foundation but by a company that views education as a product and unabashedly wants to profit from it . at first glance , the colorful and bright classrooms of the new phorms elementary school berlin-mitte just north of downtown berlin seems like any other , complete with tables and chairs , drawings and games and books . but a closer look at this spanking new elementary school in an old factory reveals distinctions : take the fact that there are fewer chairs for students , meaning the class sizes are smaller than in state schools - or the latest technology hanging on the walls , such as a " smart " blackboard that operates by computer . the most unusual differences , however , lie in the concept and management of the school : it is owned and run by a private company that offers shares , has a chief executive officer , a chief financial officer and a board of directors with a wealth of business experience .
it aims to turn a profit with its product education . national heresy ? it certainly seems like heresy in a country like germany in which even a university education is free .
when politicians wanting to shake up the country 's languishing education system proposed " elite " universities and tuition a few years ago , there was an uproar . still , private elementary and secondary schools in germany are not new even as the concept for paying for schooling is for most germans .
mostly , private schools in the past decades catered to the thousands of expatriate families , serving in the military or working in companies in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bea beste says that education is a product more recently , things are changing in the german educational landscape .
parents are inundated with studies such as the pisa one by the organization for economic development and cooperation laying out the deficiencies of the public school system - the german school system ranked near the bottom compared to its neighbors .
still , that is n't telling german parents anything they have n't already known for years , said phorms ceo bea beste . as a result , it is n't surprising that the number of students in germany attending private schools has jumped about 30 percent in the past decade , according government statistics - more than 600,000 youngsters eschewed public school in 2005 . that is something phorms is set on capitalizing on . " let 's conceive our product and establish it as a brand in germany , " said bea beste , ceo of the management company and a consultant in marketing and branding .
" the idea is to take a look at the weaknesses of the german system and offer an alternative .
our concept is n't to make a lot of money but to offer a quality product through playing by the rules of business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cfo johannes nagel expects profits in one year phorms cfo johannes nagel said that the berlin school itself - which has about 50 students in grades 1 to 5 - will turn a profit by the end of the school year .
the company is expected to be able to pay dividends in about six years .
and meanwhile , schools in munich , hamburg , frankfurt and possibly düsseldorf are planned for next year .
in 2008 , the company wants to open another five to eight schools . " education is a product that people are willing to pay for , " he said .
" we are confident that this will work . " desperate for solutions beste , one of the original founders of the school , said that the name phorms is a combination of the german word for form and metamorphosis .
this is the idea behind the company 's educational concept , she said : helping children to learn and grow . the school wants to do this by offering a language immersion program with students learning in both german and english .
it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .
and students are a diverse group with about 40 percent coming from german families and the rest either of mixed nationalities or foreign residents . what seems to most impress parents is the school 's individual focus and nurturing environment for children , enticing them to pay the sliding scale tuition that ranges from 200 to 800 euros -lrb- $ 250 to $ 1,000 -rrb- per month , based on family income . " i was desperate to find a school for my son and i did n't care what it was going to cost , " said lisa kay c. smith , an american resident whose 9-year-old son , david , attended german public school for two years .
" there was an unacceptable level of violence in the state schools and the school officials would n't deal with it .
at phorms , they take the attitude that it takes a village to raise a child and deal with issues and the child as an individual . " unethical profits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children helped prepare their own playground such opinions do n't impress the school 's critics such as josef kraus , head of the german teacher 's union . " it is unethical to profit on the backs of children , " he told der spiegel magazine . but betrand freiesleben , whose 6-year-old son , friedrich , attends the school , said he thinks differently .
he chose the school for its bilingual education , innovative and open approach and small classes .
and he said that he wants to give the school time before passing judgement . " there are some who say , ' how dare you earn money off children , " ' he said .
" but there is nothing bad about this as long as it is not the main interest .
and as far as i can tell , it is not .

" commenting on criticism , notably from financial analysts , that the problems at airbus arise largely from political interference to defend the national interests of partners and industrial jobs , bischoff commented that two big private shareholders , the german auto group daimlerchrysler and lagardere group of france , did not necessarily accept such pressures . he said : " there is no reason to assume that daimlerchrysler or lagardere group want to make sacrifices on the altar of national feelings . " factories in germany lined up for sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg could be in danger on wednesday , airbus denied a report in german newspaper bild , quoting well-informed sources , that the company wanted to sell five factories in germany employing 6,600 people . the report said that airbus wanted to sell the factories as quickly as it could to investors who would continue to operate them as suppliers to airbus but at reduced operating costs .
employees would keep their jobs but their pay would fall . however , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting on thursday that the effort of restructuring in the group should be spread evenly between france and germany . finance only one problem airbus needs solving eads has announced severe cost-saving targets to pull airbus out of a crisis arising from delays of about two years in deliveries of its star product , the a380 superjumbo airliner .
however , the company has acknowledged that it faces several other problems , notably in the way it is organized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new co-ceo gallois looks to tackle one crisis at a time in the space of two weeks , the man brought in to sort the company out , christian streiff , presented the results of an internal audit , laid down objectives and outlined a plan to achieve them ; but he then resigned after only 100 days in the job to be replaced by louis gallois , co-chief executive at eads . gallois has said that he intends to pursue the objectives , but that he will need up to three months to work out the details , commenting in germany on thursday that much press comment about the extent and location of cuts was misplaced since proposals and decisions had yet to be made . german state bank lining up bid , says paper meanwhile german government officials and the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw are preparing a contract for the bank to buy a stake in european aerospace giant eads early next year , according to the financial times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state bank kfz has made no comment the contract would be ready for signature by the end of the year , the report said , quoting one official as commenting that germany did not want a block of shares to fall into french or russian hands . german politicians are currently sending conflicting signals over the prospect of an entry by the german state into the share capital of eads . on thursday , hamburg 's mayor , ole von beust , had announced that a definite agreement had been reached , with only the concrete details yet to be worked out .
but his comments were swiftly qualified by chancellor angela merkel , who insisted that no decision had been reached , even if no single option was explicitly being ruled out . germans wary of heavy french , russian influence in its friday edition , ft quoted unnamed government officials as saying that the chancellery , finance and industry ministries had agreed on an option to buy a 7.5-percent stake in eads expected to be put up for sale by daimlerchrysler , which currently holds 22.5 percent of the aerospace firm .
the stake was valued at 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- , the newspaper said . " we do n't want that stake to end up in the hands of -lrb- french president jacques -rrb- chirac or -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin , " ft quoted one official as saying . moscow owns a stake of just over five percent via russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank and has expressed an interest in gaining a greater say in the running of eads . a government spokesman again refused to comment on the report , pointing to merkel 's comments on thursday . while the option of kfw taking over part of the daimlerchrysler stake is not seen as ideal in germany , the prospects of finding a private investor seem slim , ft said . berlin would not demand another seat on the eads supervisory board if it were indeed to acquire the stake , the newspaper continued . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks investors for eads chancellor angela merkel indicated on thursday the government was looking for private german investors to buy a stake in european aerospace company eads and help secure its future .

" it is great happiness for us all that a turkish writer has won such a prestigious award , " foreign minister abdullah gül told reporters at a joint press conference with his visiting afghan counterpart rangin dadfar spanta . in an apparent reference to the controversies pamuk has stirred up , gul said : " many day-to-day things are soon forgotten but the fact that a turkish writer has won the nobel award will echo throughout the world ...
it is great publicity for turkey . " " this is a historic day , " said metin celal , chairman of the turkish publishers ' union , forecasting that pamuk 's success would put turkish literature firmly on the world map . author delighted with prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was congratulated by the turkish government france , germany and the european commission also hailed the news , while pamuk himself said he was delighted . " it 's such a great honor , such a great pleasure , " pamuk told journalists at columbia university in new york .
" i think that this is first of all an honor bestowed upon the turkish language , turkish culture , turkey and also recognition of my labors ... my humble devotion to that great art of the novel . " turkey 's congratulations came despite bad blood between the establishment and the 54-year-old author , who has challenged official policies and rejected the accolade of " state artist " . the timing of the award was ironic . just hours before the swedish academy announced the award , the french parliament approved a bill making it an offense punishable by prison to deny that the ottoman turks committed genocide against armenians during world war i. pamuk himself was put on trial earlier this year for challenging the official line on the massacres , which turkey denies were genocide . pamuk praised by those who once damned him bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac was said to be delighted for pamuk french president jacques chirac said he was " delighted " that pamuk had won the nobel literature prize .

" the victims have to live with the crime for their whole lives and i think it 's fair that the offenders should also have to live with it , " hamburg 's spd leader mathias petersen told bild zeitung daily on thursday . dorothee bär , a csu parliamentarian , also backs the proposal .
" the security of our children should come before data protection , " she said . kristina köhler , bär 's colleague from partner party cdu and member of the bundestag 's interior committee , added that the legal basis of the american model would have to be examined before being implemented in germany . bayreuth murder spurred " black list " proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries has spoken out against the register demands for the internet registry follow the rape and murder of a 39-year-old nurse in bayreuth . the alleged offender had been convicted of rape , kidnapping and extortionate robbery five year earlier .
though he had been sentenced to eight years in prison , he was released in september 2006 . in light of the bayreuth murder , bavarian csu leader joachim herrmann made an appeal this week for a " black list " for errant prisoner evaluators that approve the release of dangerous criminals . however , not all members of the governing coalition support an internet registry for sex offenders . drawbacks to a public registry " publishing names and addresses on the internet takes away the possibility of starting over - even after the offender has already served his time , " justice minister brigitte zypries told afp on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do open files mean privacy violation or crime prevention ?
spd parliamentarian dieter wiefelspütz said that the proposed registry would " open the shooting ground " instead of providing increased security , according to a spiegel online report .
in spring 2006 , the state of maine removed its internet registry after two registered sex offenders on the public list were shot to death . what 's more , the constitutionality of the registry has come into question . peter m. huber , a constitutional lawyer in munich called the proposal " constitutionally highly problematic " and said that sex offenders also had a " right to self-determination of information , " wrote spiegel online . young politicians demand life sentence at the other end of the spectrum members of bavaria 's youth union -lrb- ju -rrb- , a branch of the csu , have suggested that public humiliation is n't harsh enough for sex offenders . the ju advocates life-long sentences for first time sex offenders and preventative detention for violent sex offenders , said ju leader manfred weber . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state of saxony considers public list of sex offenders saxony 's interior minister has called for a public register of sex offenders ' whereabouts after a 13-year old spent five weeks in the clutches of a man convicted for sex crimes who lived in her dresden neighborhood .

" the project would first be introduced in november in five cities in the country 's north , where bremen is located , she said on a television talk show .
starting in 2007 , the project would be expanded to four more of germany 's 16 states .
it was expected to cost 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , she said . the government had already recognized that child neglect was a problem and had set up a working group to tackle it at the beginning of the year , justice minister brigitte zypries said in an interview in the berliner zeitung newspaper on friday .
the experts ' recommendations on how to improve cooperation and communication between all parties were expected to be completed before the end of the year .
billions not millions child protection organization deutsche kinderhilfe direkt welcomed the plan to establish an early warning system but said it was too little and that billions , not millions , of euros were necessary to make a difference .
there are too few care facilities for children in danger of abuse causing the childcare agencies to put off removing them from their families as long as possible , according to the group 's head , georg ehrmann . " developing care facilities costs real money , " he said . the deutsche kinderschutzbund , another child protection organization , said new legislation was n't necessary to protect kids from neglect , but that the existing laws needed to be applied . kevin 's body was found on tuesday .

germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .
the winners are ensured millions in state funds for years .
the losers may face a bleak future . german research and education minister annette schavan announced friday that munich 's ludwig-maximilian university , munich 's technical university -lrb- tu -rrb- and the university of karlsruhe had been named germany 's first " elite universities . "
the three institutions are the biggest winners in germany 's " excellence initiative , " which was established to improve the country 's chronically under-funded colleges - and its reputation abroad - by encouraging high level research and competition .
the trio will receive around 120 million euros -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- each in federal and state funds over the next five years . " so far , no german university has made it into the top 50 worldwide , but if we carry out our concept for the future , after five years we could be among the first 25 , " tu president wolfgang a. herrmann told handelsblatt online portal .
developing excellence in total , 22 projects from universities , mainly in germany 's richest states , were singled out to receive a portion of the 1.9 billion euros earmarked for the initiative between 2007 and 2011 .
the money will be distributed in three areas : for graduate schools that showed they knew how to promote new talent ; for " research clusters " that demonstrated they were centers of excellence in particular fields ; and finally for three top institutions that encompassed all of the previous qualities as well as presenting a dazzling vision of a future of educational excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to resurrect its image as a research leader bavaria , of which munich is the capital , and baden-württemberg , where karlsruhe is located , cleaned up in the competition , with eight of the 18 successful graduate schools and another eight of the 17 recognized research clusters , which are meant to be developed into a small number of internationally recognized research institutes . universities in the country 's north and east went largely unacknowledged in the expert panel 's decisions , causing some to predict they could end up as even bigger losers in the future as ever more funding goes to institutions in the south and west , already among the country 's wealthiest regions . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.10.2006 opinion : abused children are everyone 's problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every member of society is responsible to do what he or she can to prevent tragedies , like that of two-year-old kevin , who was found dead in his father 's freezer this week , from occurring , according to dw 's dirk bathe . no , this time the question is not as it usually is in such cases : how could this happen ?
the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .
that is our responsibility . dirk bathe is a politics editor at dw-radio -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans early warning system to protect children germany 's family minister said an early warning system would go into effect this year to prevent children from being neglected days after the body of two-year-old kevin was found in his father 's freezer in bremen .

the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 13.10.2006 pamuk praised by european leaders and contemporaries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orhan panuk 's nobel prize for literature win was widely praised european officials and writers reacted with delight to the news on thursday that orhan pamuk had won the 2006 nobel literature prize , becoming the first turk to win the coveted award . praise was particularly effusive in turkey itself , where the political dissident has often clashed with the establishment . " it is great happiness for us all that a turkish writer has won such a prestigious award , " foreign minister abdullah gül told reporters at a joint press conference with his visiting afghan counterpart rangin dadfar spanta . in an apparent reference to the controversies pamuk has stirred up , gul said : " many day-to-day things are soon forgotten but the fact that a turkish writer has won the nobel award will echo throughout the world ...
it is great publicity for turkey . " " this is a historic day , " said metin celal , chairman of the turkish publishers ' union , forecasting that pamuk 's success would put turkish literature firmly on the world map . author delighted with prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was congratulated by the turkish government france , germany and the european commission also hailed the news , while pamuk himself said he was delighted . " it 's such a great honor , such a great pleasure , " pamuk told journalists at columbia university in new york .
" i think that this is first of all an honor bestowed upon the turkish language , turkish culture , turkey and also recognition of my labors ... my humble devotion to that great art of the novel . " turkey 's congratulations came despite bad blood between the establishment and the 54-year-old author , who has challenged official policies and rejected the accolade of " state artist " . the timing of the award was ironic . just hours before the swedish academy announced the award , the french parliament approved a bill making it an offense punishable by prison to deny that the ottoman turks committed genocide against armenians during world war i. pamuk himself was put on trial earlier this year for challenging the official line on the massacres , which turkey denies were genocide . pamuk praised by those who once damned him bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac was said to be delighted for pamuk french president jacques chirac said he was " delighted " that pamuk had won the nobel literature prize .
chirac said he was " particularly delighted " saying pamuk 's " reflection on society is ... intelligent , strong and liberal " . the case against pamuk was dropped on a technicality but not before a provincial official ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books .
ankara swiftly stopped the move , wary of undermining its democratic credentials in european union eyes . in brussels eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the award a victory for " artistic freedom and for freedom of expression . " a prize for freedom of speech " it is good news for all those who want to speak , search , learn the truth , pursue dialogue , exchange thoughts and knowledge - not just in turkey but everywhere else , " the finnish commissioner said .
" artists ... need freedom of expression as desperately as life needs water and air .
orhan knows more than others how precious and fragile such freedom is . " rehn recalled pamuk telling him during his legal woes he just wanted to " write books again and free my mind from all this harassment .

" commenting on criticism , notably from financial analysts , that the problems at airbus arise largely from political interference to defend the national interests of partners and industrial jobs , bischoff commented that two big private shareholders , the german auto group daimlerchrysler and lagardere group of france , did not necessarily accept such pressures . he said : " there is no reason to assume that daimlerchrysler or lagardere group want to make sacrifices on the altar of national feelings . " factories in germany lined up for sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg could be in danger on wednesday , airbus denied a report in german newspaper bild , quoting well-informed sources , that the company wanted to sell five factories in germany employing 6,600 people . the report said that airbus wanted to sell the factories as quickly as it could to investors who would continue to operate them as suppliers to airbus but at reduced operating costs .
employees would keep their jobs but their pay would fall . however , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting on thursday that the effort of restructuring in the group should be spread evenly between france and germany . finance only one problem airbus needs solving eads has announced severe cost-saving targets to pull airbus out of a crisis arising from delays of about two years in deliveries of its star product , the a380 superjumbo airliner .
however , the company has acknowledged that it faces several other problems , notably in the way it is organized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new co-ceo gallois looks to tackle one crisis at a time in the space of two weeks , the man brought in to sort the company out , christian streiff , presented the results of an internal audit , laid down objectives and outlined a plan to achieve them ; but he then resigned after only 100 days in the job to be replaced by louis gallois , co-chief executive at eads . gallois has said that he intends to pursue the objectives , but that he will need up to three months to work out the details , commenting in germany on thursday that much press comment about the extent and location of cuts was misplaced since proposals and decisions had yet to be made . german state bank lining up bid , says paper meanwhile german government officials and the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw are preparing a contract for the bank to buy a stake in european aerospace giant eads early next year , according to the financial times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state bank kfz has made no comment the contract would be ready for signature by the end of the year , the report said , quoting one official as commenting that germany did not want a block of shares to fall into french or russian hands . german politicians are currently sending conflicting signals over the prospect of an entry by the german state into the share capital of eads . on thursday , hamburg 's mayor , ole von beust , had announced that a definite agreement had been reached , with only the concrete details yet to be worked out .
but his comments were swiftly qualified by chancellor angela merkel , who insisted that no decision had been reached , even if no single option was explicitly being ruled out . germans wary of heavy french , russian influence in its friday edition , ft quoted unnamed government officials as saying that the chancellery , finance and industry ministries had agreed on an option to buy a 7.5-percent stake in eads expected to be put up for sale by daimlerchrysler , which currently holds 22.5 percent of the aerospace firm .
the stake was valued at 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- , the newspaper said . " we do n't want that stake to end up in the hands of -lrb- french president jacques -rrb- chirac or -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin , " ft quoted one official as saying . moscow owns a stake of just over five percent via russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank and has expressed an interest in gaining a greater say in the running of eads . a government spokesman again refused to comment on the report , pointing to merkel 's comments on thursday . while the option of kfw taking over part of the daimlerchrysler stake is not seen as ideal in germany , the prospects of finding a private investor seem slim , ft said . berlin would not demand another seat on the eads supervisory board if it were indeed to acquire the stake , the newspaper continued . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks investors for eads chancellor angela merkel indicated on thursday the government was looking for private german investors to buy a stake in european aerospace company eads and help secure its future .

it is not run by a church or foundation but by a company that views education as a product and unabashedly wants to profit from it . at first glance , the colorful and bright classrooms of the new phorms elementary school berlin-mitte just north of downtown berlin seems like any other , complete with tables and chairs , drawings and games and books . but a closer look at this spanking new elementary school in an old factory reveals distinctions : take the fact that there are fewer chairs for students , meaning the class sizes are smaller than in state schools - or the latest technology hanging on the walls , such as a " smart " blackboard that operates by computer . the most unusual differences , however , lie in the concept and management of the school : it is owned and run by a private company that offers shares , has a chief executive officer , a chief financial officer and a board of directors with a wealth of business experience .
it aims to turn a profit with its product education . national heresy ? it certainly seems like heresy in a country like germany in which even a university education is free .
when politicians wanting to shake up the country 's languishing education system proposed " elite " universities and tuition a few years ago , there was an uproar . still , private elementary and secondary schools in germany are not new even as the concept for paying for schooling is for most germans .
mostly , private schools in the past decades catered to the thousands of expatriate families , serving in the military or working in companies in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bea beste says that education is a product more recently , things are changing in the german educational landscape .
parents are inundated with studies such as the pisa one by the organization for economic development and cooperation laying out the deficiencies of the public school system - the german school system ranked near the bottom compared to its neighbors .
still , that is n't telling german parents anything they have n't already known for years , said phorms ceo bea beste . as a result , it is n't surprising that the number of students in germany attending private schools has jumped about 30 percent in the past decade , according government statistics - more than 600,000 youngsters eschewed public school in 2005 . that is something phorms is set on capitalizing on .

" we are confident that this will work . " desperate for solutions beste , one of the original founders of the school , said that the name phorms is a combination of the german word for form and metamorphosis .
this is the idea behind the company 's educational concept , she said : helping children to learn and grow . the school wants to do this by offering a language immersion program with students learning in both german and english .
it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .
and students are a diverse group with about 40 percent coming from german families and the rest either of mixed nationalities or foreign residents . what seems to most impress parents is the school 's individual focus and nurturing environment for children , enticing them to pay the sliding scale tuition that ranges from 200 to 800 euros -lrb- $ 250 to $ 1,000 -rrb- per month , based on family income . " i was desperate to find a school for my son and i did n't care what it was going to cost , " said lisa kay c. smith , an american resident whose 9-year-old son , david , attended german public school for two years .
" there was an unacceptable level of violence in the state schools and the school officials would n't deal with it .

the small coin-sized mechanism can open - and lock again - dozens of doors , cabinets and gates which have been programmed to respond to it , meaning the days of the heavy keychain might be numbered . the device can also be programmed to read biometric data from an individual , meaning only he or she can operate it and only open certain locks . " let 's imagine we have a large building housing several companies , " said lars gneisse , simons and voss 's product manager , who stepped into a virtual elevator with a reporter .
" we can program the device so that workers at a company only have access to the floors they work on . " meeting terrorism threats in another hall at the show , there is a jeep with bullet-ridden windows and an exterior body that has been nearly shredded .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on berlin berliners celebrate new shopping hours " poor but sexy berlin " offers five-star hotels on the cheap looking forward to a smoke-free berlin questions arise about the future of " sexy but poor " berlin education -pipe- 13.10.2006 berlin school wants to profit from education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phorms intends to be profitable in six years phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .
it is not run by a church or foundation but by a company that views education as a product and unabashedly wants to profit from it . at first glance , the colorful and bright classrooms of the new phorms elementary school berlin-mitte just north of downtown berlin seems like any other , complete with tables and chairs , drawings and games and books . but a closer look at this spanking new elementary school in an old factory reveals distinctions : take the fact that there are fewer chairs for students , meaning the class sizes are smaller than in state schools - or the latest technology hanging on the walls , such as a " smart " blackboard that operates by computer . the most unusual differences , however , lie in the concept and management of the school : it is owned and run by a private company that offers shares , has a chief executive officer , a chief financial officer and a board of directors with a wealth of business experience .
it aims to turn a profit with its product education . national heresy ? it certainly seems like heresy in a country like germany in which even a university education is free .
when politicians wanting to shake up the country 's languishing education system proposed " elite " universities and tuition a few years ago , there was an uproar . still , private elementary and secondary schools in germany are not new even as the concept for paying for schooling is for most germans .
mostly , private schools in the past decades catered to the thousands of expatriate families , serving in the military or working in companies in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bea beste says that education is a product more recently , things are changing in the german educational landscape .
parents are inundated with studies such as the pisa one by the organization for economic development and cooperation laying out the deficiencies of the public school system - the german school system ranked near the bottom compared to its neighbors .
still , that is n't telling german parents anything they have n't already known for years , said phorms ceo bea beste . as a result , it is n't surprising that the number of students in germany attending private schools has jumped about 30 percent in the past decade , according government statistics - more than 600,000 youngsters eschewed public school in 2005 . that is something phorms is set on capitalizing on . " let 's conceive our product and establish it as a brand in germany , " said bea beste , ceo of the management company and a consultant in marketing and branding .
" the idea is to take a look at the weaknesses of the german system and offer an alternative .
our concept is n't to make a lot of money but to offer a quality product through playing by the rules of business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cfo johannes nagel expects profits in one year phorms cfo johannes nagel said that the berlin school itself - which has about 50 students in grades 1 to 5 - will turn a profit by the end of the school year .
the company is expected to be able to pay dividends in about six years .
and meanwhile , schools in munich , hamburg , frankfurt and possibly düsseldorf are planned for next year .
in 2008 , the company wants to open another five to eight schools . " education is a product that people are willing to pay for , " he said .
" we are confident that this will work . " desperate for solutions beste , one of the original founders of the school , said that the name phorms is a combination of the german word for form and metamorphosis .
this is the idea behind the company 's educational concept , she said : helping children to learn and grow . the school wants to do this by offering a language immersion program with students learning in both german and english .
it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .
and students are a diverse group with about 40 percent coming from german families and the rest either of mixed nationalities or foreign residents . what seems to most impress parents is the school 's individual focus and nurturing environment for children , enticing them to pay the sliding scale tuition that ranges from 200 to 800 euros -lrb- $ 250 to $ 1,000 -rrb- per month , based on family income . " i was desperate to find a school for my son and i did n't care what it was going to cost , " said lisa kay c. smith , an american resident whose 9-year-old son , david , attended german public school for two years .
" there was an unacceptable level of violence in the state schools and the school officials would n't deal with it .
at phorms , they take the attitude that it takes a village to raise a child and deal with issues and the child as an individual . " unethical profits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children helped prepare their own playground such opinions do n't impress the school 's critics such as josef kraus , head of the german teacher 's union . " it is unethical to profit on the backs of children , " he told der spiegel magazine . but betrand freiesleben , whose 6-year-old son , friedrich , attends the school , said he thinks differently .
he chose the school for its bilingual education , innovative and open approach and small classes .
and he said that he wants to give the school time before passing judgement . " there are some who say , ' how dare you earn money off children , " ' he said .
" but there is nothing bad about this as long as it is not the main interest .
and as far as i can tell , it is not .

" commenting on criticism , notably from financial analysts , that the problems at airbus arise largely from political interference to defend the national interests of partners and industrial jobs , bischoff commented that two big private shareholders , the german auto group daimlerchrysler and lagardere group of france , did not necessarily accept such pressures . he said : " there is no reason to assume that daimlerchrysler or lagardere group want to make sacrifices on the altar of national feelings . " factories in germany lined up for sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg could be in danger on wednesday , airbus denied a report in german newspaper bild , quoting well-informed sources , that the company wanted to sell five factories in germany employing 6,600 people . the report said that airbus wanted to sell the factories as quickly as it could to investors who would continue to operate them as suppliers to airbus but at reduced operating costs .
employees would keep their jobs but their pay would fall . however , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting on thursday that the effort of restructuring in the group should be spread evenly between france and germany . finance only one problem airbus needs solving eads has announced severe cost-saving targets to pull airbus out of a crisis arising from delays of about two years in deliveries of its star product , the a380 superjumbo airliner .
however , the company has acknowledged that it faces several other problems , notably in the way it is organized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new co-ceo gallois looks to tackle one crisis at a time in the space of two weeks , the man brought in to sort the company out , christian streiff , presented the results of an internal audit , laid down objectives and outlined a plan to achieve them ; but he then resigned after only 100 days in the job to be replaced by louis gallois , co-chief executive at eads . gallois has said that he intends to pursue the objectives , but that he will need up to three months to work out the details , commenting in germany on thursday that much press comment about the extent and location of cuts was misplaced since proposals and decisions had yet to be made . german state bank lining up bid , says paper meanwhile german government officials and the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw are preparing a contract for the bank to buy a stake in european aerospace giant eads early next year , according to the financial times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state bank kfz has made no comment the contract would be ready for signature by the end of the year , the report said , quoting one official as commenting that germany did not want a block of shares to fall into french or russian hands . german politicians are currently sending conflicting signals over the prospect of an entry by the german state into the share capital of eads . on thursday , hamburg 's mayor , ole von beust , had announced that a definite agreement had been reached , with only the concrete details yet to be worked out .
but his comments were swiftly qualified by chancellor angela merkel , who insisted that no decision had been reached , even if no single option was explicitly being ruled out . germans wary of heavy french , russian influence in its friday edition , ft quoted unnamed government officials as saying that the chancellery , finance and industry ministries had agreed on an option to buy a 7.5-percent stake in eads expected to be put up for sale by daimlerchrysler , which currently holds 22.5 percent of the aerospace firm .
the stake was valued at 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- , the newspaper said . " we do n't want that stake to end up in the hands of -lrb- french president jacques -rrb- chirac or -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin , " ft quoted one official as saying . moscow owns a stake of just over five percent via russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank and has expressed an interest in gaining a greater say in the running of eads . a government spokesman again refused to comment on the report , pointing to merkel 's comments on thursday . while the option of kfw taking over part of the daimlerchrysler stake is not seen as ideal in germany , the prospects of finding a private investor seem slim , ft said . berlin would not demand another seat on the eads supervisory board if it were indeed to acquire the stake , the newspaper continued . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks investors for eads chancellor angela merkel indicated on thursday the government was looking for private german investors to buy a stake in european aerospace company eads and help secure its future .

germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .
the winners are ensured millions in state funds for years .
the losers may face a bleak future . german research and education minister annette schavan announced friday that munich 's ludwig-maximilian university , munich 's technical university -lrb- tu -rrb- and the university of karlsruhe had been named germany 's first " elite universities . "
the three institutions are the biggest winners in germany 's " excellence initiative , " which was established to improve the country 's chronically under-funded colleges - and its reputation abroad - by encouraging high level research and competition .
the trio will receive around 120 million euros -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- each in federal and state funds over the next five years . " so far , no german university has made it into the top 50 worldwide , but if we carry out our concept for the future , after five years we could be among the first 25 , " tu president wolfgang a. herrmann told handelsblatt online portal .
developing excellence in total , 22 projects from universities , mainly in germany 's richest states , were singled out to receive a portion of the 1.9 billion euros earmarked for the initiative between 2007 and 2011 .
the money will be distributed in three areas : for graduate schools that showed they knew how to promote new talent ; for " research clusters " that demonstrated they were centers of excellence in particular fields ; and finally for three top institutions that encompassed all of the previous qualities as well as presenting a dazzling vision of a future of educational excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to resurrect its image as a research leader bavaria , of which munich is the capital , and baden-württemberg , where karlsruhe is located , cleaned up in the competition , with eight of the 18 successful graduate schools and another eight of the 17 recognized research clusters , which are meant to be developed into a small number of internationally recognized research institutes . universities in the country 's north and east went largely unacknowledged in the expert panel 's decisions , causing some to predict they could end up as even bigger losers in the future as ever more funding goes to institutions in the south and west , already among the country 's wealthiest regions . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .
that is our responsibility . dirk bathe is a politics editor at dw-radio -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans early warning system to protect children germany 's family minister said an early warning system would go into effect this year to prevent children from being neglected days after the body of two-year-old kevin was found in his father 's freezer in bremen .

" commenting on criticism , notably from financial analysts , that the problems at airbus arise largely from political interference to defend the national interests of partners and industrial jobs , bischoff commented that two big private shareholders , the german auto group daimlerchrysler and lagardere group of france , did not necessarily accept such pressures . he said : " there is no reason to assume that daimlerchrysler or lagardere group want to make sacrifices on the altar of national feelings . " factories in germany lined up for sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg could be in danger on wednesday , airbus denied a report in german newspaper bild , quoting well-informed sources , that the company wanted to sell five factories in germany employing 6,600 people . the report said that airbus wanted to sell the factories as quickly as it could to investors who would continue to operate them as suppliers to airbus but at reduced operating costs .
employees would keep their jobs but their pay would fall . however , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting on thursday that the effort of restructuring in the group should be spread evenly between france and germany . finance only one problem airbus needs solving eads has announced severe cost-saving targets to pull airbus out of a crisis arising from delays of about two years in deliveries of its star product , the a380 superjumbo airliner .
however , the company has acknowledged that it faces several other problems , notably in the way it is organized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new co-ceo gallois looks to tackle one crisis at a time in the space of two weeks , the man brought in to sort the company out , christian streiff , presented the results of an internal audit , laid down objectives and outlined a plan to achieve them ; but he then resigned after only 100 days in the job to be replaced by louis gallois , co-chief executive at eads . gallois has said that he intends to pursue the objectives , but that he will need up to three months to work out the details , commenting in germany on thursday that much press comment about the extent and location of cuts was misplaced since proposals and decisions had yet to be made . german state bank lining up bid , says paper meanwhile german government officials and the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw are preparing a contract for the bank to buy a stake in european aerospace giant eads early next year , according to the financial times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state bank kfz has made no comment the contract would be ready for signature by the end of the year , the report said , quoting one official as commenting that germany did not want a block of shares to fall into french or russian hands . german politicians are currently sending conflicting signals over the prospect of an entry by the german state into the share capital of eads . on thursday , hamburg 's mayor , ole von beust , had announced that a definite agreement had been reached , with only the concrete details yet to be worked out .

german politicians from the left-wing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have proposed a similar initiative . " the victims have to live with the crime for their whole lives and i think it 's fair that the offenders should also have to live with it , " hamburg 's spd leader mathias petersen told bild zeitung daily on thursday . dorothee bär , a csu parliamentarian , also backs the proposal .
" the security of our children should come before data protection , " she said . kristina köhler , bär 's colleague from partner party cdu and member of the bundestag 's interior committee , added that the legal basis of the american model would have to be examined before being implemented in germany . bayreuth murder spurred " black list " proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries has spoken out against the register demands for the internet registry follow the rape and murder of a 39-year-old nurse in bayreuth . the alleged offender had been convicted of rape , kidnapping and extortionate robbery five year earlier .
though he had been sentenced to eight years in prison , he was released in september 2006 . in light of the bayreuth murder , bavarian csu leader joachim herrmann made an appeal this week for a " black list " for errant prisoner evaluators that approve the release of dangerous criminals . however , not all members of the governing coalition support an internet registry for sex offenders . drawbacks to a public registry " publishing names and addresses on the internet takes away the possibility of starting over - even after the offender has already served his time , " justice minister brigitte zypries told afp on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do open files mean privacy violation or crime prevention ?
spd parliamentarian dieter wiefelspütz said that the proposed registry would " open the shooting ground " instead of providing increased security , according to a spiegel online report .
in spring 2006 , the state of maine removed its internet registry after two registered sex offenders on the public list were shot to death . what 's more , the constitutionality of the registry has come into question . peter m. huber , a constitutional lawyer in munich called the proposal " constitutionally highly problematic " and said that sex offenders also had a " right to self-determination of information , " wrote spiegel online . young politicians demand life sentence at the other end of the spectrum members of bavaria 's youth union -lrb- ju -rrb- , a branch of the csu , have suggested that public humiliation is n't harsh enough for sex offenders . the ju advocates life-long sentences for first time sex offenders and preventative detention for violent sex offenders , said ju leader manfred weber . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state of saxony considers public list of sex offenders saxony 's interior minister has called for a public register of sex offenders ' whereabouts after a 13-year old spent five weeks in the clutches of a man convicted for sex crimes who lived in her dresden neighborhood .
-lrb- 28.02.2006 -rrb- france tests " chemical castration " in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward .
-lrb- 08.01.2005 -rrb- preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators .
-lrb- 02.08.2004 -rrb- surveys should germany put a publicly accessible registry of sex offenders on the internet ?
yes , all sex offenders should be listed for life .
yes , but the time the sex offender is listed should correspond to the severity of the crime .
no , the public should not have access to a registry of sex offenders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.10.2006 opinion : abused children are everyone 's problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every member of society is responsible to do what he or she can to prevent tragedies , like that of two-year-old kevin , who was found dead in his father 's freezer this week , from occurring , according to dw 's dirk bathe . no , this time the question is not as it usually is in such cases : how could this happen ?
the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.10.2006 opinion : abused children are everyone 's problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every member of society is responsible to do what he or she can to prevent tragedies , like that of two-year-old kevin , who was found dead in his father 's freezer this week , from occurring , according to dw 's dirk bathe . no , this time the question is not as it usually is in such cases : how could this happen ?
the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .

it is not run by a church or foundation but by a company that views education as a product and unabashedly wants to profit from it . at first glance , the colorful and bright classrooms of the new phorms elementary school berlin-mitte just north of downtown berlin seems like any other , complete with tables and chairs , drawings and games and books . but a closer look at this spanking new elementary school in an old factory reveals distinctions : take the fact that there are fewer chairs for students , meaning the class sizes are smaller than in state schools - or the latest technology hanging on the walls , such as a " smart " blackboard that operates by computer . the most unusual differences , however , lie in the concept and management of the school : it is owned and run by a private company that offers shares , has a chief executive officer , a chief financial officer and a board of directors with a wealth of business experience .
it aims to turn a profit with its product education . national heresy ? it certainly seems like heresy in a country like germany in which even a university education is free .
when politicians wanting to shake up the country 's languishing education system proposed " elite " universities and tuition a few years ago , there was an uproar . still , private elementary and secondary schools in germany are not new even as the concept for paying for schooling is for most germans .
mostly , private schools in the past decades catered to the thousands of expatriate families , serving in the military or working in companies in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bea beste says that education is a product more recently , things are changing in the german educational landscape .
parents are inundated with studies such as the pisa one by the organization for economic development and cooperation laying out the deficiencies of the public school system - the german school system ranked near the bottom compared to its neighbors .
still , that is n't telling german parents anything they have n't already known for years , said phorms ceo bea beste . as a result , it is n't surprising that the number of students in germany attending private schools has jumped about 30 percent in the past decade , according government statistics - more than 600,000 youngsters eschewed public school in 2005 . that is something phorms is set on capitalizing on . " let 's conceive our product and establish it as a brand in germany , " said bea beste , ceo of the management company and a consultant in marketing and branding .
" the idea is to take a look at the weaknesses of the german system and offer an alternative .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cfo johannes nagel expects profits in one year phorms cfo johannes nagel said that the berlin school itself - which has about 50 students in grades 1 to 5 - will turn a profit by the end of the school year .
the company is expected to be able to pay dividends in about six years .
and meanwhile , schools in munich , hamburg , frankfurt and possibly düsseldorf are planned for next year .
in 2008 , the company wants to open another five to eight schools . " education is a product that people are willing to pay for , " he said .
" we are confident that this will work . " desperate for solutions beste , one of the original founders of the school , said that the name phorms is a combination of the german word for form and metamorphosis .
this is the idea behind the company 's educational concept , she said : helping children to learn and grow . the school wants to do this by offering a language immersion program with students learning in both german and english .
it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .
and students are a diverse group with about 40 percent coming from german families and the rest either of mixed nationalities or foreign residents . what seems to most impress parents is the school 's individual focus and nurturing environment for children , enticing them to pay the sliding scale tuition that ranges from 200 to 800 euros -lrb- $ 250 to $ 1,000 -rrb- per month , based on family income . " i was desperate to find a school for my son and i did n't care what it was going to cost , " said lisa kay c. smith , an american resident whose 9-year-old son , david , attended german public school for two years .

german politicians from the left-wing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have proposed a similar initiative . " the victims have to live with the crime for their whole lives and i think it 's fair that the offenders should also have to live with it , " hamburg 's spd leader mathias petersen told bild zeitung daily on thursday . dorothee bär , a csu parliamentarian , also backs the proposal .
" the security of our children should come before data protection , " she said . kristina köhler , bär 's colleague from partner party cdu and member of the bundestag 's interior committee , added that the legal basis of the american model would have to be examined before being implemented in germany . bayreuth murder spurred " black list " proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries has spoken out against the register demands for the internet registry follow the rape and murder of a 39-year-old nurse in bayreuth . the alleged offender had been convicted of rape , kidnapping and extortionate robbery five year earlier .
though he had been sentenced to eight years in prison , he was released in september 2006 . in light of the bayreuth murder , bavarian csu leader joachim herrmann made an appeal this week for a " black list " for errant prisoner evaluators that approve the release of dangerous criminals . however , not all members of the governing coalition support an internet registry for sex offenders . drawbacks to a public registry " publishing names and addresses on the internet takes away the possibility of starting over - even after the offender has already served his time , " justice minister brigitte zypries told afp on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do open files mean privacy violation or crime prevention ?
spd parliamentarian dieter wiefelspütz said that the proposed registry would " open the shooting ground " instead of providing increased security , according to a spiegel online report .
in spring 2006 , the state of maine removed its internet registry after two registered sex offenders on the public list were shot to death . what 's more , the constitutionality of the registry has come into question . peter m. huber , a constitutional lawyer in munich called the proposal " constitutionally highly problematic " and said that sex offenders also had a " right to self-determination of information , " wrote spiegel online . young politicians demand life sentence at the other end of the spectrum members of bavaria 's youth union -lrb- ju -rrb- , a branch of the csu , have suggested that public humiliation is n't harsh enough for sex offenders . the ju advocates life-long sentences for first time sex offenders and preventative detention for violent sex offenders , said ju leader manfred weber . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state of saxony considers public list of sex offenders saxony 's interior minister has called for a public register of sex offenders ' whereabouts after a 13-year old spent five weeks in the clutches of a man convicted for sex crimes who lived in her dresden neighborhood .

" it is great happiness for us all that a turkish writer has won such a prestigious award , " foreign minister abdullah gül told reporters at a joint press conference with his visiting afghan counterpart rangin dadfar spanta . in an apparent reference to the controversies pamuk has stirred up , gul said : " many day-to-day things are soon forgotten but the fact that a turkish writer has won the nobel award will echo throughout the world ...

" turkey 's congratulations came despite bad blood between the establishment and the 54-year-old author , who has challenged official policies and rejected the accolade of " state artist " . the timing of the award was ironic . just hours before the swedish academy announced the award , the french parliament approved a bill making it an offense punishable by prison to deny that the ottoman turks committed genocide against armenians during world war i. pamuk himself was put on trial earlier this year for challenging the official line on the massacres , which turkey denies were genocide . pamuk praised by those who once damned him bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac was said to be delighted for pamuk french president jacques chirac said he was " delighted " that pamuk had won the nobel literature prize .

ankara swiftly stopped the move , wary of undermining its democratic credentials in european union eyes . in brussels eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the award a victory for " artistic freedom and for freedom of expression . " a prize for freedom of speech " it is good news for all those who want to speak , search , learn the truth , pursue dialogue , exchange thoughts and knowledge - not just in turkey but everywhere else , " the finnish commissioner said .
" artists ... need freedom of expression as desperately as life needs water and air .
orhan knows more than others how precious and fragile such freedom is . " rehn recalled pamuk telling him during his legal woes he just wanted to " write books again and free my mind from all this harassment . " pamuk 's novels , which include " snow " and " my name is red , " regularly tackle turkey 's decades-old internal struggle between islam and secularism . " in his home country , pamuk has a reputation as a social commentator even though he sees himself principally as a fiction writer with no political agenda , " the nobel jury commented . " a builder of bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier acknowledged pamuk 's cultural influence in germany , whose 2.5-million-strong turkish community is the biggest outside turkey itself , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hailed pamuk as a " builder of bridges . " he is a symbol for the wish of large parts of turkish society to become a part of europe , " said steinmeier , who supports turkey 's bid to join the eu . pamuk 's editor in france , jean mattern , said the nobel panel had rewarded " the quality of his writing and the force of his message . " his work has always tackled political and historical issues head on , " he told reporters . pamuk 's turkish publisher , iletisim , was also delighted . " we are very happy , " said academic and iletisim editor ahmet insel .
" pamuk is an important representative of the modern novel in the world , " he told ntv . of the writer 's political views , insel said : " if we take a look at the long history of the nobel literature prize , we see that the authors who won the award have made important political statements on the future of their countries and the world .

" the project would first be introduced in november in five cities in the country 's north , where bremen is located , she said on a television talk show .
starting in 2007 , the project would be expanded to four more of germany 's 16 states .
it was expected to cost 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , she said . the government had already recognized that child neglect was a problem and had set up a working group to tackle it at the beginning of the year , justice minister brigitte zypries said in an interview in the berliner zeitung newspaper on friday .
the experts ' recommendations on how to improve cooperation and communication between all parties were expected to be completed before the end of the year .
billions not millions child protection organization deutsche kinderhilfe direkt welcomed the plan to establish an early warning system but said it was too little and that billions , not millions , of euros were necessary to make a difference .
there are too few care facilities for children in danger of abuse causing the childcare agencies to put off removing them from their families as long as possible , according to the group 's head , georg ehrmann . " developing care facilities costs real money , " he said . the deutsche kinderschutzbund , another child protection organization , said new legislation was n't necessary to protect kids from neglect , but that the existing laws needed to be applied . kevin 's body was found on tuesday .
a family court had ordered that the boy be taken away from his father , a known drug addict prone to violent outbursts , but officials were too late to save him . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a boy 's death shows failure of german child welfare system on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .

" commenting on criticism , notably from financial analysts , that the problems at airbus arise largely from political interference to defend the national interests of partners and industrial jobs , bischoff commented that two big private shareholders , the german auto group daimlerchrysler and lagardere group of france , did not necessarily accept such pressures . he said : " there is no reason to assume that daimlerchrysler or lagardere group want to make sacrifices on the altar of national feelings . " factories in germany lined up for sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg could be in danger on wednesday , airbus denied a report in german newspaper bild , quoting well-informed sources , that the company wanted to sell five factories in germany employing 6,600 people . the report said that airbus wanted to sell the factories as quickly as it could to investors who would continue to operate them as suppliers to airbus but at reduced operating costs .
employees would keep their jobs but their pay would fall . however , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting on thursday that the effort of restructuring in the group should be spread evenly between france and germany . finance only one problem airbus needs solving eads has announced severe cost-saving targets to pull airbus out of a crisis arising from delays of about two years in deliveries of its star product , the a380 superjumbo airliner .
however , the company has acknowledged that it faces several other problems , notably in the way it is organized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new co-ceo gallois looks to tackle one crisis at a time in the space of two weeks , the man brought in to sort the company out , christian streiff , presented the results of an internal audit , laid down objectives and outlined a plan to achieve them ; but he then resigned after only 100 days in the job to be replaced by louis gallois , co-chief executive at eads . gallois has said that he intends to pursue the objectives , but that he will need up to three months to work out the details , commenting in germany on thursday that much press comment about the extent and location of cuts was misplaced since proposals and decisions had yet to be made . german state bank lining up bid , says paper meanwhile german government officials and the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw are preparing a contract for the bank to buy a stake in european aerospace giant eads early next year , according to the financial times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state bank kfz has made no comment the contract would be ready for signature by the end of the year , the report said , quoting one official as commenting that germany did not want a block of shares to fall into french or russian hands . german politicians are currently sending conflicting signals over the prospect of an entry by the german state into the share capital of eads . on thursday , hamburg 's mayor , ole von beust , had announced that a definite agreement had been reached , with only the concrete details yet to be worked out .
but his comments were swiftly qualified by chancellor angela merkel , who insisted that no decision had been reached , even if no single option was explicitly being ruled out . germans wary of heavy french , russian influence in its friday edition , ft quoted unnamed government officials as saying that the chancellery , finance and industry ministries had agreed on an option to buy a 7.5-percent stake in eads expected to be put up for sale by daimlerchrysler , which currently holds 22.5 percent of the aerospace firm .
the stake was valued at 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- , the newspaper said . " we do n't want that stake to end up in the hands of -lrb- french president jacques -rrb- chirac or -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin , " ft quoted one official as saying . moscow owns a stake of just over five percent via russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank and has expressed an interest in gaining a greater say in the running of eads . a government spokesman again refused to comment on the report , pointing to merkel 's comments on thursday . while the option of kfw taking over part of the daimlerchrysler stake is not seen as ideal in germany , the prospects of finding a private investor seem slim , ft said . berlin would not demand another seat on the eads supervisory board if it were indeed to acquire the stake , the newspaper continued . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks investors for eads chancellor angela merkel indicated on thursday the government was looking for private german investors to buy a stake in european aerospace company eads and help secure its future .

" it is great happiness for us all that a turkish writer has won such a prestigious award , " foreign minister abdullah gül told reporters at a joint press conference with his visiting afghan counterpart rangin dadfar spanta . in an apparent reference to the controversies pamuk has stirred up , gul said : " many day-to-day things are soon forgotten but the fact that a turkish writer has won the nobel award will echo throughout the world ...
it is great publicity for turkey . " " this is a historic day , " said metin celal , chairman of the turkish publishers ' union , forecasting that pamuk 's success would put turkish literature firmly on the world map . author delighted with prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was congratulated by the turkish government france , germany and the european commission also hailed the news , while pamuk himself said he was delighted . " it 's such a great honor , such a great pleasure , " pamuk told journalists at columbia university in new york .
" i think that this is first of all an honor bestowed upon the turkish language , turkish culture , turkey and also recognition of my labors ... my humble devotion to that great art of the novel . " turkey 's congratulations came despite bad blood between the establishment and the 54-year-old author , who has challenged official policies and rejected the accolade of " state artist " . the timing of the award was ironic . just hours before the swedish academy announced the award , the french parliament approved a bill making it an offense punishable by prison to deny that the ottoman turks committed genocide against armenians during world war i. pamuk himself was put on trial earlier this year for challenging the official line on the massacres , which turkey denies were genocide . pamuk praised by those who once damned him bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac was said to be delighted for pamuk french president jacques chirac said he was " delighted " that pamuk had won the nobel literature prize .
chirac said he was " particularly delighted " saying pamuk 's " reflection on society is ... intelligent , strong and liberal " . the case against pamuk was dropped on a technicality but not before a provincial official ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books .
ankara swiftly stopped the move , wary of undermining its democratic credentials in european union eyes . in brussels eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the award a victory for " artistic freedom and for freedom of expression . " a prize for freedom of speech " it is good news for all those who want to speak , search , learn the truth , pursue dialogue , exchange thoughts and knowledge - not just in turkey but everywhere else , " the finnish commissioner said .
" artists ... need freedom of expression as desperately as life needs water and air .
orhan knows more than others how precious and fragile such freedom is . " rehn recalled pamuk telling him during his legal woes he just wanted to " write books again and free my mind from all this harassment . " pamuk 's novels , which include " snow " and " my name is red , " regularly tackle turkey 's decades-old internal struggle between islam and secularism . " in his home country , pamuk has a reputation as a social commentator even though he sees himself principally as a fiction writer with no political agenda , " the nobel jury commented . " a builder of bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier acknowledged pamuk 's cultural influence in germany , whose 2.5-million-strong turkish community is the biggest outside turkey itself , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hailed pamuk as a " builder of bridges . " he is a symbol for the wish of large parts of turkish society to become a part of europe , " said steinmeier , who supports turkey 's bid to join the eu . pamuk 's editor in france , jean mattern , said the nobel panel had rewarded " the quality of his writing and the force of his message . " his work has always tackled political and historical issues head on , " he told reporters . pamuk 's turkish publisher , iletisim , was also delighted . " we are very happy , " said academic and iletisim editor ahmet insel .
" pamuk is an important representative of the modern novel in the world , " he told ntv . of the writer 's political views , insel said : " if we take a look at the long history of the nobel literature prize , we see that the authors who won the award have made important political statements on the future of their countries and the world .

it is not run by a church or foundation but by a company that views education as a product and unabashedly wants to profit from it . at first glance , the colorful and bright classrooms of the new phorms elementary school berlin-mitte just north of downtown berlin seems like any other , complete with tables and chairs , drawings and games and books . but a closer look at this spanking new elementary school in an old factory reveals distinctions : take the fact that there are fewer chairs for students , meaning the class sizes are smaller than in state schools - or the latest technology hanging on the walls , such as a " smart " blackboard that operates by computer . the most unusual differences , however , lie in the concept and management of the school : it is owned and run by a private company that offers shares , has a chief executive officer , a chief financial officer and a board of directors with a wealth of business experience .
it aims to turn a profit with its product education . national heresy ? it certainly seems like heresy in a country like germany in which even a university education is free .
when politicians wanting to shake up the country 's languishing education system proposed " elite " universities and tuition a few years ago , there was an uproar . still , private elementary and secondary schools in germany are not new even as the concept for paying for schooling is for most germans .
mostly , private schools in the past decades catered to the thousands of expatriate families , serving in the military or working in companies in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bea beste says that education is a product more recently , things are changing in the german educational landscape .
parents are inundated with studies such as the pisa one by the organization for economic development and cooperation laying out the deficiencies of the public school system - the german school system ranked near the bottom compared to its neighbors .
still , that is n't telling german parents anything they have n't already known for years , said phorms ceo bea beste . as a result , it is n't surprising that the number of students in germany attending private schools has jumped about 30 percent in the past decade , according government statistics - more than 600,000 youngsters eschewed public school in 2005 . that is something phorms is set on capitalizing on . " let 's conceive our product and establish it as a brand in germany , " said bea beste , ceo of the management company and a consultant in marketing and branding .
" the idea is to take a look at the weaknesses of the german system and offer an alternative .
our concept is n't to make a lot of money but to offer a quality product through playing by the rules of business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cfo johannes nagel expects profits in one year phorms cfo johannes nagel said that the berlin school itself - which has about 50 students in grades 1 to 5 - will turn a profit by the end of the school year .
the company is expected to be able to pay dividends in about six years .
and meanwhile , schools in munich , hamburg , frankfurt and possibly düsseldorf are planned for next year .
in 2008 , the company wants to open another five to eight schools . " education is a product that people are willing to pay for , " he said .
" we are confident that this will work . " desperate for solutions beste , one of the original founders of the school , said that the name phorms is a combination of the german word for form and metamorphosis .
this is the idea behind the company 's educational concept , she said : helping children to learn and grow . the school wants to do this by offering a language immersion program with students learning in both german and english .
it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .
and students are a diverse group with about 40 percent coming from german families and the rest either of mixed nationalities or foreign residents . what seems to most impress parents is the school 's individual focus and nurturing environment for children , enticing them to pay the sliding scale tuition that ranges from 200 to 800 euros -lrb- $ 250 to $ 1,000 -rrb- per month , based on family income . " i was desperate to find a school for my son and i did n't care what it was going to cost , " said lisa kay c. smith , an american resident whose 9-year-old son , david , attended german public school for two years .
" there was an unacceptable level of violence in the state schools and the school officials would n't deal with it .
at phorms , they take the attitude that it takes a village to raise a child and deal with issues and the child as an individual . " unethical profits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children helped prepare their own playground such opinions do n't impress the school 's critics such as josef kraus , head of the german teacher 's union . " it is unethical to profit on the backs of children , " he told der spiegel magazine . but betrand freiesleben , whose 6-year-old son , friedrich , attends the school , said he thinks differently .
he chose the school for its bilingual education , innovative and open approach and small classes .
and he said that he wants to give the school time before passing judgement . " there are some who say , ' how dare you earn money off children , " ' he said .
" but there is nothing bad about this as long as it is not the main interest .
and as far as i can tell , it is not .

it aims to turn a profit with its product education . national heresy ? it certainly seems like heresy in a country like germany in which even a university education is free .
when politicians wanting to shake up the country 's languishing education system proposed " elite " universities and tuition a few years ago , there was an uproar . still , private elementary and secondary schools in germany are not new even as the concept for paying for schooling is for most germans .

it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 13.10.2006 german politicians propose internet registry for sex offenders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians want to publish sex offenders ' names , other want life sentences after a 39-year-old woman was recently raped and murdered in bayreuth by a repeated sex offender , both liberal and conservative politicians have recommended starting an internet registry based on the us model . in the us , the internet-based " national alert registry " allows users to enter their zip code and access a list of registered sex offenders in their area , complete with address and color photo .
german politicians from the left-wing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have proposed a similar initiative . " the victims have to live with the crime for their whole lives and i think it 's fair that the offenders should also have to live with it , " hamburg 's spd leader mathias petersen told bild zeitung daily on thursday . dorothee bär , a csu parliamentarian , also backs the proposal .
" the security of our children should come before data protection , " she said . kristina köhler , bär 's colleague from partner party cdu and member of the bundestag 's interior committee , added that the legal basis of the american model would have to be examined before being implemented in germany . bayreuth murder spurred " black list " proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries has spoken out against the register demands for the internet registry follow the rape and murder of a 39-year-old nurse in bayreuth . the alleged offender had been convicted of rape , kidnapping and extortionate robbery five year earlier .
though he had been sentenced to eight years in prison , he was released in september 2006 . in light of the bayreuth murder , bavarian csu leader joachim herrmann made an appeal this week for a " black list " for errant prisoner evaluators that approve the release of dangerous criminals . however , not all members of the governing coalition support an internet registry for sex offenders . drawbacks to a public registry " publishing names and addresses on the internet takes away the possibility of starting over - even after the offender has already served his time , " justice minister brigitte zypries told afp on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do open files mean privacy violation or crime prevention ?
spd parliamentarian dieter wiefelspütz said that the proposed registry would " open the shooting ground " instead of providing increased security , according to a spiegel online report .
in spring 2006 , the state of maine removed its internet registry after two registered sex offenders on the public list were shot to death . what 's more , the constitutionality of the registry has come into question . peter m. huber , a constitutional lawyer in munich called the proposal " constitutionally highly problematic " and said that sex offenders also had a " right to self-determination of information , " wrote spiegel online . young politicians demand life sentence at the other end of the spectrum members of bavaria 's youth union -lrb- ju -rrb- , a branch of the csu , have suggested that public humiliation is n't harsh enough for sex offenders . the ju advocates life-long sentences for first time sex offenders and preventative detention for violent sex offenders , said ju leader manfred weber . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state of saxony considers public list of sex offenders saxony 's interior minister has called for a public register of sex offenders ' whereabouts after a 13-year old spent five weeks in the clutches of a man convicted for sex crimes who lived in her dresden neighborhood .
-lrb- 28.02.2006 -rrb- france tests " chemical castration " in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward .
-lrb- 08.01.2005 -rrb- preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators .
-lrb- 02.08.2004 -rrb- surveys should germany put a publicly accessible registry of sex offenders on the internet ?
yes , all sex offenders should be listed for life .
yes , but the time the sex offender is listed should correspond to the severity of the crime .
no , the public should not have access to a registry of sex offenders .

germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .
the winners are ensured millions in state funds for years .
the losers may face a bleak future . german research and education minister annette schavan announced friday that munich 's ludwig-maximilian university , munich 's technical university -lrb- tu -rrb- and the university of karlsruhe had been named germany 's first " elite universities . "
the three institutions are the biggest winners in germany 's " excellence initiative , " which was established to improve the country 's chronically under-funded colleges - and its reputation abroad - by encouraging high level research and competition .
the trio will receive around 120 million euros -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- each in federal and state funds over the next five years . " so far , no german university has made it into the top 50 worldwide , but if we carry out our concept for the future , after five years we could be among the first 25 , " tu president wolfgang a. herrmann told handelsblatt online portal .
developing excellence in total , 22 projects from universities , mainly in germany 's richest states , were singled out to receive a portion of the 1.9 billion euros earmarked for the initiative between 2007 and 2011 .
the money will be distributed in three areas : for graduate schools that showed they knew how to promote new talent ; for " research clusters " that demonstrated they were centers of excellence in particular fields ; and finally for three top institutions that encompassed all of the previous qualities as well as presenting a dazzling vision of a future of educational excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to resurrect its image as a research leader bavaria , of which munich is the capital , and baden-württemberg , where karlsruhe is located , cleaned up in the competition , with eight of the 18 successful graduate schools and another eight of the 17 recognized research clusters , which are meant to be developed into a small number of internationally recognized research institutes . universities in the country 's north and east went largely unacknowledged in the expert panel 's decisions , causing some to predict they could end up as even bigger losers in the future as ever more funding goes to institutions in the south and west , already among the country 's wealthiest regions . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .
that is our responsibility . dirk bathe is a politics editor at dw-radio -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans early warning system to protect children germany 's family minister said an early warning system would go into effect this year to prevent children from being neglected days after the body of two-year-old kevin was found in his father 's freezer in bremen .

" the project would first be introduced in november in five cities in the country 's north , where bremen is located , she said on a television talk show .
starting in 2007 , the project would be expanded to four more of germany 's 16 states .
it was expected to cost 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , she said . the government had already recognized that child neglect was a problem and had set up a working group to tackle it at the beginning of the year , justice minister brigitte zypries said in an interview in the berliner zeitung newspaper on friday .
the experts ' recommendations on how to improve cooperation and communication between all parties were expected to be completed before the end of the year .
billions not millions child protection organization deutsche kinderhilfe direkt welcomed the plan to establish an early warning system but said it was too little and that billions , not millions , of euros were necessary to make a difference .
there are too few care facilities for children in danger of abuse causing the childcare agencies to put off removing them from their families as long as possible , according to the group 's head , georg ehrmann . " developing care facilities costs real money , " he said . the deutsche kinderschutzbund , another child protection organization , said new legislation was n't necessary to protect kids from neglect , but that the existing laws needed to be applied . kevin 's body was found on tuesday .
a family court had ordered that the boy be taken away from his father , a known drug addict prone to violent outbursts , but officials were too late to save him . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a boy 's death shows failure of german child welfare system on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.10.2006 opinion : abused children are everyone 's problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every member of society is responsible to do what he or she can to prevent tragedies , like that of two-year-old kevin , who was found dead in his father 's freezer this week , from occurring , according to dw 's dirk bathe . no , this time the question is not as it usually is in such cases : how could this happen ?
the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .
that is our responsibility . dirk bathe is a politics editor at dw-radio -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans early warning system to protect children germany 's family minister said an early warning system would go into effect this year to prevent children from being neglected days after the body of two-year-old kevin was found in his father 's freezer in bremen .

german politicians from the left-wing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have proposed a similar initiative . " the victims have to live with the crime for their whole lives and i think it 's fair that the offenders should also have to live with it , " hamburg 's spd leader mathias petersen told bild zeitung daily on thursday . dorothee bär , a csu parliamentarian , also backs the proposal .
" the security of our children should come before data protection , " she said . kristina köhler , bär 's colleague from partner party cdu and member of the bundestag 's interior committee , added that the legal basis of the american model would have to be examined before being implemented in germany . bayreuth murder spurred " black list " proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries has spoken out against the register demands for the internet registry follow the rape and murder of a 39-year-old nurse in bayreuth . the alleged offender had been convicted of rape , kidnapping and extortionate robbery five year earlier .
though he had been sentenced to eight years in prison , he was released in september 2006 . in light of the bayreuth murder , bavarian csu leader joachim herrmann made an appeal this week for a " black list " for errant prisoner evaluators that approve the release of dangerous criminals . however , not all members of the governing coalition support an internet registry for sex offenders . drawbacks to a public registry " publishing names and addresses on the internet takes away the possibility of starting over - even after the offender has already served his time , " justice minister brigitte zypries told afp on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do open files mean privacy violation or crime prevention ?
spd parliamentarian dieter wiefelspütz said that the proposed registry would " open the shooting ground " instead of providing increased security , according to a spiegel online report .
in spring 2006 , the state of maine removed its internet registry after two registered sex offenders on the public list were shot to death . what 's more , the constitutionality of the registry has come into question . peter m. huber , a constitutional lawyer in munich called the proposal " constitutionally highly problematic " and said that sex offenders also had a " right to self-determination of information , " wrote spiegel online . young politicians demand life sentence at the other end of the spectrum members of bavaria 's youth union -lrb- ju -rrb- , a branch of the csu , have suggested that public humiliation is n't harsh enough for sex offenders . the ju advocates life-long sentences for first time sex offenders and preventative detention for violent sex offenders , said ju leader manfred weber . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state of saxony considers public list of sex offenders saxony 's interior minister has called for a public register of sex offenders ' whereabouts after a 13-year old spent five weeks in the clutches of a man convicted for sex crimes who lived in her dresden neighborhood .

germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .
the winners are ensured millions in state funds for years .
the losers may face a bleak future . german research and education minister annette schavan announced friday that munich 's ludwig-maximilian university , munich 's technical university -lrb- tu -rrb- and the university of karlsruhe had been named germany 's first " elite universities . "
the three institutions are the biggest winners in germany 's " excellence initiative , " which was established to improve the country 's chronically under-funded colleges - and its reputation abroad - by encouraging high level research and competition .
the trio will receive around 120 million euros -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- each in federal and state funds over the next five years . " so far , no german university has made it into the top 50 worldwide , but if we carry out our concept for the future , after five years we could be among the first 25 , " tu president wolfgang a. herrmann told handelsblatt online portal .
developing excellence in total , 22 projects from universities , mainly in germany 's richest states , were singled out to receive a portion of the 1.9 billion euros earmarked for the initiative between 2007 and 2011 .
the money will be distributed in three areas : for graduate schools that showed they knew how to promote new talent ; for " research clusters " that demonstrated they were centers of excellence in particular fields ; and finally for three top institutions that encompassed all of the previous qualities as well as presenting a dazzling vision of a future of educational excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to resurrect its image as a research leader bavaria , of which munich is the capital , and baden-württemberg , where karlsruhe is located , cleaned up in the competition , with eight of the 18 successful graduate schools and another eight of the 17 recognized research clusters , which are meant to be developed into a small number of internationally recognized research institutes . universities in the country 's north and east went largely unacknowledged in the expert panel 's decisions , causing some to predict they could end up as even bigger losers in the future as ever more funding goes to institutions in the south and west , already among the country 's wealthiest regions . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin school wants to profit from education phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.10.2006 opinion : abused children are everyone 's problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every member of society is responsible to do what he or she can to prevent tragedies , like that of two-year-old kevin , who was found dead in his father 's freezer this week , from occurring , according to dw 's dirk bathe . no , this time the question is not as it usually is in such cases : how could this happen ?
the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .
that is our responsibility . dirk bathe is a politics editor at dw-radio -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans early warning system to protect children germany 's family minister said an early warning system would go into effect this year to prevent children from being neglected days after the body of two-year-old kevin was found in his father 's freezer in bremen .

it is not run by a church or foundation but by a company that views education as a product and unabashedly wants to profit from it . at first glance , the colorful and bright classrooms of the new phorms elementary school berlin-mitte just north of downtown berlin seems like any other , complete with tables and chairs , drawings and games and books . but a closer look at this spanking new elementary school in an old factory reveals distinctions : take the fact that there are fewer chairs for students , meaning the class sizes are smaller than in state schools - or the latest technology hanging on the walls , such as a " smart " blackboard that operates by computer . the most unusual differences , however , lie in the concept and management of the school : it is owned and run by a private company that offers shares , has a chief executive officer , a chief financial officer and a board of directors with a wealth of business experience .
it aims to turn a profit with its product education . national heresy ? it certainly seems like heresy in a country like germany in which even a university education is free .
when politicians wanting to shake up the country 's languishing education system proposed " elite " universities and tuition a few years ago , there was an uproar . still , private elementary and secondary schools in germany are not new even as the concept for paying for schooling is for most germans .
mostly , private schools in the past decades catered to the thousands of expatriate families , serving in the military or working in companies in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bea beste says that education is a product more recently , things are changing in the german educational landscape .
parents are inundated with studies such as the pisa one by the organization for economic development and cooperation laying out the deficiencies of the public school system - the german school system ranked near the bottom compared to its neighbors .
still , that is n't telling german parents anything they have n't already known for years , said phorms ceo bea beste . as a result , it is n't surprising that the number of students in germany attending private schools has jumped about 30 percent in the past decade , according government statistics - more than 600,000 youngsters eschewed public school in 2005 . that is something phorms is set on capitalizing on . " let 's conceive our product and establish it as a brand in germany , " said bea beste , ceo of the management company and a consultant in marketing and branding .
" the idea is to take a look at the weaknesses of the german system and offer an alternative .
our concept is n't to make a lot of money but to offer a quality product through playing by the rules of business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cfo johannes nagel expects profits in one year phorms cfo johannes nagel said that the berlin school itself - which has about 50 students in grades 1 to 5 - will turn a profit by the end of the school year .
the company is expected to be able to pay dividends in about six years .
and meanwhile , schools in munich , hamburg , frankfurt and possibly düsseldorf are planned for next year .
in 2008 , the company wants to open another five to eight schools . " education is a product that people are willing to pay for , " he said .
" we are confident that this will work . " desperate for solutions beste , one of the original founders of the school , said that the name phorms is a combination of the german word for form and metamorphosis .
this is the idea behind the company 's educational concept , she said : helping children to learn and grow . the school wants to do this by offering a language immersion program with students learning in both german and english .
it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .
and students are a diverse group with about 40 percent coming from german families and the rest either of mixed nationalities or foreign residents . what seems to most impress parents is the school 's individual focus and nurturing environment for children , enticing them to pay the sliding scale tuition that ranges from 200 to 800 euros -lrb- $ 250 to $ 1,000 -rrb- per month , based on family income . " i was desperate to find a school for my son and i did n't care what it was going to cost , " said lisa kay c. smith , an american resident whose 9-year-old son , david , attended german public school for two years .
" there was an unacceptable level of violence in the state schools and the school officials would n't deal with it .
at phorms , they take the attitude that it takes a village to raise a child and deal with issues and the child as an individual . " unethical profits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children helped prepare their own playground such opinions do n't impress the school 's critics such as josef kraus , head of the german teacher 's union . " it is unethical to profit on the backs of children , " he told der spiegel magazine . but betrand freiesleben , whose 6-year-old son , friedrich , attends the school , said he thinks differently .
he chose the school for its bilingual education , innovative and open approach and small classes .
and he said that he wants to give the school time before passing judgement . " there are some who say , ' how dare you earn money off children , " ' he said .
" but there is nothing bad about this as long as it is not the main interest .
and as far as i can tell , it is not .

it is not run by a church or foundation but by a company that views education as a product and unabashedly wants to profit from it . at first glance , the colorful and bright classrooms of the new phorms elementary school berlin-mitte just north of downtown berlin seems like any other , complete with tables and chairs , drawings and games and books . but a closer look at this spanking new elementary school in an old factory reveals distinctions : take the fact that there are fewer chairs for students , meaning the class sizes are smaller than in state schools - or the latest technology hanging on the walls , such as a " smart " blackboard that operates by computer . the most unusual differences , however , lie in the concept and management of the school : it is owned and run by a private company that offers shares , has a chief executive officer , a chief financial officer and a board of directors with a wealth of business experience .
it aims to turn a profit with its product education . national heresy ? it certainly seems like heresy in a country like germany in which even a university education is free .
when politicians wanting to shake up the country 's languishing education system proposed " elite " universities and tuition a few years ago , there was an uproar . still , private elementary and secondary schools in germany are not new even as the concept for paying for schooling is for most germans .
mostly , private schools in the past decades catered to the thousands of expatriate families , serving in the military or working in companies in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bea beste says that education is a product more recently , things are changing in the german educational landscape .
parents are inundated with studies such as the pisa one by the organization for economic development and cooperation laying out the deficiencies of the public school system - the german school system ranked near the bottom compared to its neighbors .
still , that is n't telling german parents anything they have n't already known for years , said phorms ceo bea beste . as a result , it is n't surprising that the number of students in germany attending private schools has jumped about 30 percent in the past decade , according government statistics - more than 600,000 youngsters eschewed public school in 2005 . that is something phorms is set on capitalizing on . " let 's conceive our product and establish it as a brand in germany , " said bea beste , ceo of the management company and a consultant in marketing and branding .
" the idea is to take a look at the weaknesses of the german system and offer an alternative .
our concept is n't to make a lot of money but to offer a quality product through playing by the rules of business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cfo johannes nagel expects profits in one year phorms cfo johannes nagel said that the berlin school itself - which has about 50 students in grades 1 to 5 - will turn a profit by the end of the school year .
the company is expected to be able to pay dividends in about six years .
and meanwhile , schools in munich , hamburg , frankfurt and possibly düsseldorf are planned for next year .
in 2008 , the company wants to open another five to eight schools . " education is a product that people are willing to pay for , " he said .
" we are confident that this will work . " desperate for solutions beste , one of the original founders of the school , said that the name phorms is a combination of the german word for form and metamorphosis .
this is the idea behind the company 's educational concept , she said : helping children to learn and grow . the school wants to do this by offering a language immersion program with students learning in both german and english .
it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .
and students are a diverse group with about 40 percent coming from german families and the rest either of mixed nationalities or foreign residents . what seems to most impress parents is the school 's individual focus and nurturing environment for children , enticing them to pay the sliding scale tuition that ranges from 200 to 800 euros -lrb- $ 250 to $ 1,000 -rrb- per month , based on family income . " i was desperate to find a school for my son and i did n't care what it was going to cost , " said lisa kay c. smith , an american resident whose 9-year-old son , david , attended german public school for two years .
" there was an unacceptable level of violence in the state schools and the school officials would n't deal with it .
at phorms , they take the attitude that it takes a village to raise a child and deal with issues and the child as an individual . " unethical profits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children helped prepare their own playground such opinions do n't impress the school 's critics such as josef kraus , head of the german teacher 's union . " it is unethical to profit on the backs of children , " he told der spiegel magazine . but betrand freiesleben , whose 6-year-old son , friedrich , attends the school , said he thinks differently .
he chose the school for its bilingual education , innovative and open approach and small classes .
and he said that he wants to give the school time before passing judgement . " there are some who say , ' how dare you earn money off children , " ' he said .
" but there is nothing bad about this as long as it is not the main interest .
and as far as i can tell , it is not .

and meanwhile , schools in munich , hamburg , frankfurt and possibly düsseldorf are planned for next year .
in 2008 , the company wants to open another five to eight schools . " education is a product that people are willing to pay for , " he said .
" we are confident that this will work . " desperate for solutions beste , one of the original founders of the school , said that the name phorms is a combination of the german word for form and metamorphosis .
this is the idea behind the company 's educational concept , she said : helping children to learn and grow . the school wants to do this by offering a language immersion program with students learning in both german and english .
it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .
and students are a diverse group with about 40 percent coming from german families and the rest either of mixed nationalities or foreign residents . what seems to most impress parents is the school 's individual focus and nurturing environment for children , enticing them to pay the sliding scale tuition that ranges from 200 to 800 euros -lrb- $ 250 to $ 1,000 -rrb- per month , based on family income . " i was desperate to find a school for my son and i did n't care what it was going to cost , " said lisa kay c. smith , an american resident whose 9-year-old son , david , attended german public school for two years .
" there was an unacceptable level of violence in the state schools and the school officials would n't deal with it .
at phorms , they take the attitude that it takes a village to raise a child and deal with issues and the child as an individual . " unethical profits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children helped prepare their own playground such opinions do n't impress the school 's critics such as josef kraus , head of the german teacher 's union . " it is unethical to profit on the backs of children , " he told der spiegel magazine . but betrand freiesleben , whose 6-year-old son , friedrich , attends the school , said he thinks differently .
he chose the school for its bilingual education , innovative and open approach and small classes .
and he said that he wants to give the school time before passing judgement . " there are some who say , ' how dare you earn money off children , " ' he said .
" but there is nothing bad about this as long as it is not the main interest .
and as far as i can tell , it is not .

german politicians from the left-wing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have proposed a similar initiative . " the victims have to live with the crime for their whole lives and i think it 's fair that the offenders should also have to live with it , " hamburg 's spd leader mathias petersen told bild zeitung daily on thursday . dorothee bär , a csu parliamentarian , also backs the proposal .
" the security of our children should come before data protection , " she said . kristina köhler , bär 's colleague from partner party cdu and member of the bundestag 's interior committee , added that the legal basis of the american model would have to be examined before being implemented in germany . bayreuth murder spurred " black list " proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries has spoken out against the register demands for the internet registry follow the rape and murder of a 39-year-old nurse in bayreuth . the alleged offender had been convicted of rape , kidnapping and extortionate robbery five year earlier .
though he had been sentenced to eight years in prison , he was released in september 2006 . in light of the bayreuth murder , bavarian csu leader joachim herrmann made an appeal this week for a " black list " for errant prisoner evaluators that approve the release of dangerous criminals . however , not all members of the governing coalition support an internet registry for sex offenders . drawbacks to a public registry " publishing names and addresses on the internet takes away the possibility of starting over - even after the offender has already served his time , " justice minister brigitte zypries told afp on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do open files mean privacy violation or crime prevention ?
spd parliamentarian dieter wiefelspütz said that the proposed registry would " open the shooting ground " instead of providing increased security , according to a spiegel online report .
in spring 2006 , the state of maine removed its internet registry after two registered sex offenders on the public list were shot to death . what 's more , the constitutionality of the registry has come into question . peter m. huber , a constitutional lawyer in munich called the proposal " constitutionally highly problematic " and said that sex offenders also had a " right to self-determination of information , " wrote spiegel online . young politicians demand life sentence at the other end of the spectrum members of bavaria 's youth union -lrb- ju -rrb- , a branch of the csu , have suggested that public humiliation is n't harsh enough for sex offenders . the ju advocates life-long sentences for first time sex offenders and preventative detention for violent sex offenders , said ju leader manfred weber . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state of saxony considers public list of sex offenders saxony 's interior minister has called for a public register of sex offenders ' whereabouts after a 13-year old spent five weeks in the clutches of a man convicted for sex crimes who lived in her dresden neighborhood .
-lrb- 28.02.2006 -rrb- france tests " chemical castration " in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward .
-lrb- 08.01.2005 -rrb- preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators .
-lrb- 02.08.2004 -rrb- surveys should germany put a publicly accessible registry of sex offenders on the internet ?
yes , all sex offenders should be listed for life .
yes , but the time the sex offender is listed should correspond to the severity of the crime .
no , the public should not have access to a registry of sex offenders .

" factories in germany lined up for sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg could be in danger on wednesday , airbus denied a report in german newspaper bild , quoting well-informed sources , that the company wanted to sell five factories in germany employing 6,600 people . the report said that airbus wanted to sell the factories as quickly as it could to investors who would continue to operate them as suppliers to airbus but at reduced operating costs .
employees would keep their jobs but their pay would fall . however , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting on thursday that the effort of restructuring in the group should be spread evenly between france and germany . finance only one problem airbus needs solving eads has announced severe cost-saving targets to pull airbus out of a crisis arising from delays of about two years in deliveries of its star product , the a380 superjumbo airliner .
however , the company has acknowledged that it faces several other problems , notably in the way it is organized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new co-ceo gallois looks to tackle one crisis at a time in the space of two weeks , the man brought in to sort the company out , christian streiff , presented the results of an internal audit , laid down objectives and outlined a plan to achieve them ; but he then resigned after only 100 days in the job to be replaced by louis gallois , co-chief executive at eads . gallois has said that he intends to pursue the objectives , but that he will need up to three months to work out the details , commenting in germany on thursday that much press comment about the extent and location of cuts was misplaced since proposals and decisions had yet to be made . german state bank lining up bid , says paper meanwhile german government officials and the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw are preparing a contract for the bank to buy a stake in european aerospace giant eads early next year , according to the financial times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state bank kfz has made no comment the contract would be ready for signature by the end of the year , the report said , quoting one official as commenting that germany did not want a block of shares to fall into french or russian hands . german politicians are currently sending conflicting signals over the prospect of an entry by the german state into the share capital of eads . on thursday , hamburg 's mayor , ole von beust , had announced that a definite agreement had been reached , with only the concrete details yet to be worked out .
but his comments were swiftly qualified by chancellor angela merkel , who insisted that no decision had been reached , even if no single option was explicitly being ruled out . germans wary of heavy french , russian influence in its friday edition , ft quoted unnamed government officials as saying that the chancellery , finance and industry ministries had agreed on an option to buy a 7.5-percent stake in eads expected to be put up for sale by daimlerchrysler , which currently holds 22.5 percent of the aerospace firm .
the stake was valued at 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- , the newspaper said .

" turkey 's congratulations came despite bad blood between the establishment and the 54-year-old author , who has challenged official policies and rejected the accolade of " state artist " . the timing of the award was ironic . just hours before the swedish academy announced the award , the french parliament approved a bill making it an offense punishable by prison to deny that the ottoman turks committed genocide against armenians during world war i. pamuk himself was put on trial earlier this year for challenging the official line on the massacres , which turkey denies were genocide . pamuk praised by those who once damned him bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac was said to be delighted for pamuk french president jacques chirac said he was " delighted " that pamuk had won the nobel literature prize .

ankara swiftly stopped the move , wary of undermining its democratic credentials in european union eyes . in brussels eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the award a victory for " artistic freedom and for freedom of expression . " a prize for freedom of speech " it is good news for all those who want to speak , search , learn the truth , pursue dialogue , exchange thoughts and knowledge - not just in turkey but everywhere else , " the finnish commissioner said .
" artists ... need freedom of expression as desperately as life needs water and air .
orhan knows more than others how precious and fragile such freedom is . " rehn recalled pamuk telling him during his legal woes he just wanted to " write books again and free my mind from all this harassment . " pamuk 's novels , which include " snow " and " my name is red , " regularly tackle turkey 's decades-old internal struggle between islam and secularism . " in his home country , pamuk has a reputation as a social commentator even though he sees himself principally as a fiction writer with no political agenda , " the nobel jury commented . " a builder of bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier acknowledged pamuk 's cultural influence in germany , whose 2.5-million-strong turkish community is the biggest outside turkey itself , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hailed pamuk as a " builder of bridges . " he is a symbol for the wish of large parts of turkish society to become a part of europe , " said steinmeier , who supports turkey 's bid to join the eu . pamuk 's editor in france , jean mattern , said the nobel panel had rewarded " the quality of his writing and the force of his message . " his work has always tackled political and historical issues head on , " he told reporters . pamuk 's turkish publisher , iletisim , was also delighted . " we are very happy , " said academic and iletisim editor ahmet insel .
" pamuk is an important representative of the modern novel in the world , " he told ntv . of the writer 's political views , insel said : " if we take a look at the long history of the nobel literature prize , we see that the authors who won the award have made important political statements on the future of their countries and the world .

" i think that this is first of all an honor bestowed upon the turkish language , turkish culture , turkey and also recognition of my labors ... my humble devotion to that great art of the novel . " turkey 's congratulations came despite bad blood between the establishment and the 54-year-old author , who has challenged official policies and rejected the accolade of " state artist " . the timing of the award was ironic . just hours before the swedish academy announced the award , the french parliament approved a bill making it an offense punishable by prison to deny that the ottoman turks committed genocide against armenians during world war i. pamuk himself was put on trial earlier this year for challenging the official line on the massacres , which turkey denies were genocide . pamuk praised by those who once damned him bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac was said to be delighted for pamuk french president jacques chirac said he was " delighted " that pamuk had won the nobel literature prize .
chirac said he was " particularly delighted " saying pamuk 's " reflection on society is ... intelligent , strong and liberal " . the case against pamuk was dropped on a technicality but not before a provincial official ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books .
ankara swiftly stopped the move , wary of undermining its democratic credentials in european union eyes . in brussels eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the award a victory for " artistic freedom and for freedom of expression . " a prize for freedom of speech " it is good news for all those who want to speak , search , learn the truth , pursue dialogue , exchange thoughts and knowledge - not just in turkey but everywhere else , " the finnish commissioner said .
" artists ... need freedom of expression as desperately as life needs water and air .
orhan knows more than others how precious and fragile such freedom is . " rehn recalled pamuk telling him during his legal woes he just wanted to " write books again and free my mind from all this harassment . " pamuk 's novels , which include " snow " and " my name is red , " regularly tackle turkey 's decades-old internal struggle between islam and secularism . " in his home country , pamuk has a reputation as a social commentator even though he sees himself principally as a fiction writer with no political agenda , " the nobel jury commented . " a builder of bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier acknowledged pamuk 's cultural influence in germany , whose 2.5-million-strong turkish community is the biggest outside turkey itself , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hailed pamuk as a " builder of bridges . " he is a symbol for the wish of large parts of turkish society to become a part of europe , " said steinmeier , who supports turkey 's bid to join the eu . pamuk 's editor in france , jean mattern , said the nobel panel had rewarded " the quality of his writing and the force of his message . " his work has always tackled political and historical issues head on , " he told reporters . pamuk 's turkish publisher , iletisim , was also delighted . " we are very happy , " said academic and iletisim editor ahmet insel .
" pamuk is an important representative of the modern novel in the world , " he told ntv . of the writer 's political views , insel said : " if we take a look at the long history of the nobel literature prize , we see that the authors who won the award have made important political statements on the future of their countries and the world .

" commenting on criticism , notably from financial analysts , that the problems at airbus arise largely from political interference to defend the national interests of partners and industrial jobs , bischoff commented that two big private shareholders , the german auto group daimlerchrysler and lagardere group of france , did not necessarily accept such pressures . he said : " there is no reason to assume that daimlerchrysler or lagardere group want to make sacrifices on the altar of national feelings . " factories in germany lined up for sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg could be in danger on wednesday , airbus denied a report in german newspaper bild , quoting well-informed sources , that the company wanted to sell five factories in germany employing 6,600 people . the report said that airbus wanted to sell the factories as quickly as it could to investors who would continue to operate them as suppliers to airbus but at reduced operating costs .
employees would keep their jobs but their pay would fall . however , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting on thursday that the effort of restructuring in the group should be spread evenly between france and germany . finance only one problem airbus needs solving eads has announced severe cost-saving targets to pull airbus out of a crisis arising from delays of about two years in deliveries of its star product , the a380 superjumbo airliner .
however , the company has acknowledged that it faces several other problems , notably in the way it is organized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new co-ceo gallois looks to tackle one crisis at a time in the space of two weeks , the man brought in to sort the company out , christian streiff , presented the results of an internal audit , laid down objectives and outlined a plan to achieve them ; but he then resigned after only 100 days in the job to be replaced by louis gallois , co-chief executive at eads . gallois has said that he intends to pursue the objectives , but that he will need up to three months to work out the details , commenting in germany on thursday that much press comment about the extent and location of cuts was misplaced since proposals and decisions had yet to be made . german state bank lining up bid , says paper meanwhile german government officials and the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw are preparing a contract for the bank to buy a stake in european aerospace giant eads early next year , according to the financial times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state bank kfz has made no comment the contract would be ready for signature by the end of the year , the report said , quoting one official as commenting that germany did not want a block of shares to fall into french or russian hands . german politicians are currently sending conflicting signals over the prospect of an entry by the german state into the share capital of eads . on thursday , hamburg 's mayor , ole von beust , had announced that a definite agreement had been reached , with only the concrete details yet to be worked out .
but his comments were swiftly qualified by chancellor angela merkel , who insisted that no decision had been reached , even if no single option was explicitly being ruled out . germans wary of heavy french , russian influence in its friday edition , ft quoted unnamed government officials as saying that the chancellery , finance and industry ministries had agreed on an option to buy a 7.5-percent stake in eads expected to be put up for sale by daimlerchrysler , which currently holds 22.5 percent of the aerospace firm .
the stake was valued at 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- , the newspaper said . " we do n't want that stake to end up in the hands of -lrb- french president jacques -rrb- chirac or -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin , " ft quoted one official as saying . moscow owns a stake of just over five percent via russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank and has expressed an interest in gaining a greater say in the running of eads . a government spokesman again refused to comment on the report , pointing to merkel 's comments on thursday . while the option of kfw taking over part of the daimlerchrysler stake is not seen as ideal in germany , the prospects of finding a private investor seem slim , ft said . berlin would not demand another seat on the eads supervisory board if it were indeed to acquire the stake , the newspaper continued . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks investors for eads chancellor angela merkel indicated on thursday the government was looking for private german investors to buy a stake in european aerospace company eads and help secure its future .

the three institutions are the biggest winners in germany 's " excellence initiative , " which was established to improve the country 's chronically under-funded colleges - and its reputation abroad - by encouraging high level research and competition .
the trio will receive around 120 million euros -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- each in federal and state funds over the next five years . " so far , no german university has made it into the top 50 worldwide , but if we carry out our concept for the future , after five years we could be among the first 25 , " tu president wolfgang a. herrmann told handelsblatt online portal .
developing excellence in total , 22 projects from universities , mainly in germany 's richest states , were singled out to receive a portion of the 1.9 billion euros earmarked for the initiative between 2007 and 2011 .

the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .

the small coin-sized mechanism can open - and lock again - dozens of doors , cabinets and gates which have been programmed to respond to it , meaning the days of the heavy keychain might be numbered . the device can also be programmed to read biometric data from an individual , meaning only he or she can operate it and only open certain locks .

the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on berlin berliners celebrate new shopping hours " poor but sexy berlin " offers five-star hotels on the cheap looking forward to a smoke-free berlin questions arise about the future of " sexy but poor " berlin education -pipe- 13.10.2006 berlin school wants to profit from education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : phorms intends to be profitable in six years phorms , a new private school in berlin , opened its doors in august .
it is not run by a church or foundation but by a company that views education as a product and unabashedly wants to profit from it . at first glance , the colorful and bright classrooms of the new phorms elementary school berlin-mitte just north of downtown berlin seems like any other , complete with tables and chairs , drawings and games and books . but a closer look at this spanking new elementary school in an old factory reveals distinctions : take the fact that there are fewer chairs for students , meaning the class sizes are smaller than in state schools - or the latest technology hanging on the walls , such as a " smart " blackboard that operates by computer . the most unusual differences , however , lie in the concept and management of the school : it is owned and run by a private company that offers shares , has a chief executive officer , a chief financial officer and a board of directors with a wealth of business experience .
it aims to turn a profit with its product education . national heresy ? it certainly seems like heresy in a country like germany in which even a university education is free .
when politicians wanting to shake up the country 's languishing education system proposed " elite " universities and tuition a few years ago , there was an uproar . still , private elementary and secondary schools in germany are not new even as the concept for paying for schooling is for most germans .
mostly , private schools in the past decades catered to the thousands of expatriate families , serving in the military or working in companies in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bea beste says that education is a product more recently , things are changing in the german educational landscape .
parents are inundated with studies such as the pisa one by the organization for economic development and cooperation laying out the deficiencies of the public school system - the german school system ranked near the bottom compared to its neighbors .
still , that is n't telling german parents anything they have n't already known for years , said phorms ceo bea beste . as a result , it is n't surprising that the number of students in germany attending private schools has jumped about 30 percent in the past decade , according government statistics - more than 600,000 youngsters eschewed public school in 2005 . that is something phorms is set on capitalizing on . " let 's conceive our product and establish it as a brand in germany , " said bea beste , ceo of the management company and a consultant in marketing and branding .
" the idea is to take a look at the weaknesses of the german system and offer an alternative .
our concept is n't to make a lot of money but to offer a quality product through playing by the rules of business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cfo johannes nagel expects profits in one year phorms cfo johannes nagel said that the berlin school itself - which has about 50 students in grades 1 to 5 - will turn a profit by the end of the school year .
the company is expected to be able to pay dividends in about six years .
and meanwhile , schools in munich , hamburg , frankfurt and possibly düsseldorf are planned for next year .
in 2008 , the company wants to open another five to eight schools . " education is a product that people are willing to pay for , " he said .
" we are confident that this will work . " desperate for solutions beste , one of the original founders of the school , said that the name phorms is a combination of the german word for form and metamorphosis .
this is the idea behind the company 's educational concept , she said : helping children to learn and grow . the school wants to do this by offering a language immersion program with students learning in both german and english .
it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .
and students are a diverse group with about 40 percent coming from german families and the rest either of mixed nationalities or foreign residents . what seems to most impress parents is the school 's individual focus and nurturing environment for children , enticing them to pay the sliding scale tuition that ranges from 200 to 800 euros -lrb- $ 250 to $ 1,000 -rrb- per month , based on family income . " i was desperate to find a school for my son and i did n't care what it was going to cost , " said lisa kay c. smith , an american resident whose 9-year-old son , david , attended german public school for two years .
" there was an unacceptable level of violence in the state schools and the school officials would n't deal with it .
at phorms , they take the attitude that it takes a village to raise a child and deal with issues and the child as an individual . " unethical profits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children helped prepare their own playground such opinions do n't impress the school 's critics such as josef kraus , head of the german teacher 's union . " it is unethical to profit on the backs of children , " he told der spiegel magazine . but betrand freiesleben , whose 6-year-old son , friedrich , attends the school , said he thinks differently .
he chose the school for its bilingual education , innovative and open approach and small classes .
and he said that he wants to give the school time before passing judgement . " there are some who say , ' how dare you earn money off children , " ' he said .
" but there is nothing bad about this as long as it is not the main interest .
and as far as i can tell , it is not .

" the project would first be introduced in november in five cities in the country 's north , where bremen is located , she said on a television talk show .
starting in 2007 , the project would be expanded to four more of germany 's 16 states .
it was expected to cost 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , she said . the government had already recognized that child neglect was a problem and had set up a working group to tackle it at the beginning of the year , justice minister brigitte zypries said in an interview in the berliner zeitung newspaper on friday .
the experts ' recommendations on how to improve cooperation and communication between all parties were expected to be completed before the end of the year .
billions not millions child protection organization deutsche kinderhilfe direkt welcomed the plan to establish an early warning system but said it was too little and that billions , not millions , of euros were necessary to make a difference .
there are too few care facilities for children in danger of abuse causing the childcare agencies to put off removing them from their families as long as possible , according to the group 's head , georg ehrmann .

" it is great happiness for us all that a turkish writer has won such a prestigious award , " foreign minister abdullah gül told reporters at a joint press conference with his visiting afghan counterpart rangin dadfar spanta . in an apparent reference to the controversies pamuk has stirred up , gul said : " many day-to-day things are soon forgotten but the fact that a turkish writer has won the nobel award will echo throughout the world ...
it is great publicity for turkey . " " this is a historic day , " said metin celal , chairman of the turkish publishers ' union , forecasting that pamuk 's success would put turkish literature firmly on the world map . author delighted with prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was congratulated by the turkish government france , germany and the european commission also hailed the news , while pamuk himself said he was delighted . " it 's such a great honor , such a great pleasure , " pamuk told journalists at columbia university in new york .
" i think that this is first of all an honor bestowed upon the turkish language , turkish culture , turkey and also recognition of my labors ... my humble devotion to that great art of the novel . " turkey 's congratulations came despite bad blood between the establishment and the 54-year-old author , who has challenged official policies and rejected the accolade of " state artist " . the timing of the award was ironic . just hours before the swedish academy announced the award , the french parliament approved a bill making it an offense punishable by prison to deny that the ottoman turks committed genocide against armenians during world war i. pamuk himself was put on trial earlier this year for challenging the official line on the massacres , which turkey denies were genocide . pamuk praised by those who once damned him bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac was said to be delighted for pamuk french president jacques chirac said he was " delighted " that pamuk had won the nobel literature prize .
chirac said he was " particularly delighted " saying pamuk 's " reflection on society is ... intelligent , strong and liberal " . the case against pamuk was dropped on a technicality but not before a provincial official ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books .
ankara swiftly stopped the move , wary of undermining its democratic credentials in european union eyes . in brussels eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the award a victory for " artistic freedom and for freedom of expression . " a prize for freedom of speech " it is good news for all those who want to speak , search , learn the truth , pursue dialogue , exchange thoughts and knowledge - not just in turkey but everywhere else , " the finnish commissioner said .
" artists ... need freedom of expression as desperately as life needs water and air .
orhan knows more than others how precious and fragile such freedom is . " rehn recalled pamuk telling him during his legal woes he just wanted to " write books again and free my mind from all this harassment . " pamuk 's novels , which include " snow " and " my name is red , " regularly tackle turkey 's decades-old internal struggle between islam and secularism . " in his home country , pamuk has a reputation as a social commentator even though he sees himself principally as a fiction writer with no political agenda , " the nobel jury commented . " a builder of bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier acknowledged pamuk 's cultural influence in germany , whose 2.5-million-strong turkish community is the biggest outside turkey itself , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hailed pamuk as a " builder of bridges . " he is a symbol for the wish of large parts of turkish society to become a part of europe , " said steinmeier , who supports turkey 's bid to join the eu . pamuk 's editor in france , jean mattern , said the nobel panel had rewarded " the quality of his writing and the force of his message . " his work has always tackled political and historical issues head on , " he told reporters . pamuk 's turkish publisher , iletisim , was also delighted . " we are very happy , " said academic and iletisim editor ahmet insel .
" pamuk is an important representative of the modern novel in the world , " he told ntv . of the writer 's political views , insel said : " if we take a look at the long history of the nobel literature prize , we see that the authors who won the award have made important political statements on the future of their countries and the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.10.2006 opinion : abused children are everyone 's problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every member of society is responsible to do what he or she can to prevent tragedies , like that of two-year-old kevin , who was found dead in his father 's freezer this week , from occurring , according to dw 's dirk bathe . no , this time the question is not as it usually is in such cases : how could this happen ?
the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .
that is our responsibility . dirk bathe is a politics editor at dw-radio -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans early warning system to protect children germany 's family minister said an early warning system would go into effect this year to prevent children from being neglected days after the body of two-year-old kevin was found in his father 's freezer in bremen .
-lrb- 13.10.2006 -rrb- a boy 's death shows failure of german child welfare system on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .
the case has horrified germans and caused political fallout , as the child was supposed to be in state custody when he died .

the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.10.2006 opinion : abused children are everyone 's problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every member of society is responsible to do what he or she can to prevent tragedies , like that of two-year-old kevin , who was found dead in his father 's freezer this week , from occurring , according to dw 's dirk bathe . no , this time the question is not as it usually is in such cases : how could this happen ?
the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .
that is our responsibility . dirk bathe is a politics editor at dw-radio -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany plans early warning system to protect children germany 's family minister said an early warning system would go into effect this year to prevent children from being neglected days after the body of two-year-old kevin was found in his father 's freezer in bremen .
-lrb- 13.10.2006 -rrb- a boy 's death shows failure of german child welfare system on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .
the case has horrified germans and caused political fallout , as the child was supposed to be in state custody when he died .
-lrb- 12.10.2006 -rrb- neglected children in the spotlight on international kids ' day international children 's day is an opportunity to consider the hardships - hunger , neglect , sickness , war - faced by millions of children .
even in germany , more children suffer than many people realize .

" commenting on criticism , notably from financial analysts , that the problems at airbus arise largely from political interference to defend the national interests of partners and industrial jobs , bischoff commented that two big private shareholders , the german auto group daimlerchrysler and lagardere group of france , did not necessarily accept such pressures . he said : " there is no reason to assume that daimlerchrysler or lagardere group want to make sacrifices on the altar of national feelings . " factories in germany lined up for sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg could be in danger on wednesday , airbus denied a report in german newspaper bild , quoting well-informed sources , that the company wanted to sell five factories in germany employing 6,600 people . the report said that airbus wanted to sell the factories as quickly as it could to investors who would continue to operate them as suppliers to airbus but at reduced operating costs .
employees would keep their jobs but their pay would fall . however , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting on thursday that the effort of restructuring in the group should be spread evenly between france and germany . finance only one problem airbus needs solving eads has announced severe cost-saving targets to pull airbus out of a crisis arising from delays of about two years in deliveries of its star product , the a380 superjumbo airliner .
however , the company has acknowledged that it faces several other problems , notably in the way it is organized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new co-ceo gallois looks to tackle one crisis at a time in the space of two weeks , the man brought in to sort the company out , christian streiff , presented the results of an internal audit , laid down objectives and outlined a plan to achieve them ; but he then resigned after only 100 days in the job to be replaced by louis gallois , co-chief executive at eads . gallois has said that he intends to pursue the objectives , but that he will need up to three months to work out the details , commenting in germany on thursday that much press comment about the extent and location of cuts was misplaced since proposals and decisions had yet to be made . german state bank lining up bid , says paper meanwhile german government officials and the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw are preparing a contract for the bank to buy a stake in european aerospace giant eads early next year , according to the financial times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state bank kfz has made no comment the contract would be ready for signature by the end of the year , the report said , quoting one official as commenting that germany did not want a block of shares to fall into french or russian hands . german politicians are currently sending conflicting signals over the prospect of an entry by the german state into the share capital of eads . on thursday , hamburg 's mayor , ole von beust , had announced that a definite agreement had been reached , with only the concrete details yet to be worked out .
but his comments were swiftly qualified by chancellor angela merkel , who insisted that no decision had been reached , even if no single option was explicitly being ruled out . germans wary of heavy french , russian influence in its friday edition , ft quoted unnamed government officials as saying that the chancellery , finance and industry ministries had agreed on an option to buy a 7.5-percent stake in eads expected to be put up for sale by daimlerchrysler , which currently holds 22.5 percent of the aerospace firm .
the stake was valued at 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- , the newspaper said . " we do n't want that stake to end up in the hands of -lrb- french president jacques -rrb- chirac or -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin , " ft quoted one official as saying . moscow owns a stake of just over five percent via russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank and has expressed an interest in gaining a greater say in the running of eads . a government spokesman again refused to comment on the report , pointing to merkel 's comments on thursday . while the option of kfw taking over part of the daimlerchrysler stake is not seen as ideal in germany , the prospects of finding a private investor seem slim , ft said . berlin would not demand another seat on the eads supervisory board if it were indeed to acquire the stake , the newspaper continued . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks investors for eads chancellor angela merkel indicated on thursday the government was looking for private german investors to buy a stake in european aerospace company eads and help secure its future .

germany 's three best , most promising universities are all located in the country 's south , a panel of experts has determined .
the winners are ensured millions in state funds for years .
the losers may face a bleak future . german research and education minister annette schavan announced friday that munich 's ludwig-maximilian university , munich 's technical university -lrb- tu -rrb- and the university of karlsruhe had been named germany 's first " elite universities . "
the three institutions are the biggest winners in germany 's " excellence initiative , " which was established to improve the country 's chronically under-funded colleges - and its reputation abroad - by encouraging high level research and competition .
the trio will receive around 120 million euros -lrb- $ 150 million -rrb- each in federal and state funds over the next five years . " so far , no german university has made it into the top 50 worldwide , but if we carry out our concept for the future , after five years we could be among the first 25 , " tu president wolfgang a. herrmann told handelsblatt online portal .
developing excellence in total , 22 projects from universities , mainly in germany 's richest states , were singled out to receive a portion of the 1.9 billion euros earmarked for the initiative between 2007 and 2011 .
the money will be distributed in three areas : for graduate schools that showed they knew how to promote new talent ; for " research clusters " that demonstrated they were centers of excellence in particular fields ; and finally for three top institutions that encompassed all of the previous qualities as well as presenting a dazzling vision of a future of educational excellence .

" the project would first be introduced in november in five cities in the country 's north , where bremen is located , she said on a television talk show .
starting in 2007 , the project would be expanded to four more of germany 's 16 states .
it was expected to cost 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , she said . the government had already recognized that child neglect was a problem and had set up a working group to tackle it at the beginning of the year , justice minister brigitte zypries said in an interview in the berliner zeitung newspaper on friday .
the experts ' recommendations on how to improve cooperation and communication between all parties were expected to be completed before the end of the year .
billions not millions child protection organization deutsche kinderhilfe direkt welcomed the plan to establish an early warning system but said it was too little and that billions , not millions , of euros were necessary to make a difference .
there are too few care facilities for children in danger of abuse causing the childcare agencies to put off removing them from their families as long as possible , according to the group 's head , georg ehrmann . " developing care facilities costs real money , " he said . the deutsche kinderschutzbund , another child protection organization , said new legislation was n't necessary to protect kids from neglect , but that the existing laws needed to be applied . kevin 's body was found on tuesday .

" the project would first be introduced in november in five cities in the country 's north , where bremen is located , she said on a television talk show .
starting in 2007 , the project would be expanded to four more of germany 's 16 states .
it was expected to cost 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.5 million -rrb- , she said . the government had already recognized that child neglect was a problem and had set up a working group to tackle it at the beginning of the year , justice minister brigitte zypries said in an interview in the berliner zeitung newspaper on friday .
the experts ' recommendations on how to improve cooperation and communication between all parties were expected to be completed before the end of the year .
billions not millions child protection organization deutsche kinderhilfe direkt welcomed the plan to establish an early warning system but said it was too little and that billions , not millions , of euros were necessary to make a difference .
there are too few care facilities for children in danger of abuse causing the childcare agencies to put off removing them from their families as long as possible , according to the group 's head , georg ehrmann . " developing care facilities costs real money , " he said . the deutsche kinderschutzbund , another child protection organization , said new legislation was n't necessary to protect kids from neglect , but that the existing laws needed to be applied . kevin 's body was found on tuesday .
a family court had ordered that the boy be taken away from his father , a known drug addict prone to violent outbursts , but officials were too late to save him . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a boy 's death shows failure of german child welfare system on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .
the case has horrified germans and caused political fallout , as the child was supposed to be in state custody when he died .
-lrb- 12.10.2006 -rrb- germany to pay parents to stay home germany has approved a new law that will pay new parents to take temporary leave .
the aim is to increase the country 's low birth rate .

" it is great happiness for us all that a turkish writer has won such a prestigious award , " foreign minister abdullah gül told reporters at a joint press conference with his visiting afghan counterpart rangin dadfar spanta . in an apparent reference to the controversies pamuk has stirred up , gul said : " many day-to-day things are soon forgotten but the fact that a turkish writer has won the nobel award will echo throughout the world ...
it is great publicity for turkey . " " this is a historic day , " said metin celal , chairman of the turkish publishers ' union , forecasting that pamuk 's success would put turkish literature firmly on the world map . author delighted with prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was congratulated by the turkish government france , germany and the european commission also hailed the news , while pamuk himself said he was delighted . " it 's such a great honor , such a great pleasure , " pamuk told journalists at columbia university in new york .
" i think that this is first of all an honor bestowed upon the turkish language , turkish culture , turkey and also recognition of my labors ... my humble devotion to that great art of the novel . " turkey 's congratulations came despite bad blood between the establishment and the 54-year-old author , who has challenged official policies and rejected the accolade of " state artist " . the timing of the award was ironic . just hours before the swedish academy announced the award , the french parliament approved a bill making it an offense punishable by prison to deny that the ottoman turks committed genocide against armenians during world war i. pamuk himself was put on trial earlier this year for challenging the official line on the massacres , which turkey denies were genocide . pamuk praised by those who once damned him bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac was said to be delighted for pamuk french president jacques chirac said he was " delighted " that pamuk had won the nobel literature prize .
chirac said he was " particularly delighted " saying pamuk 's " reflection on society is ... intelligent , strong and liberal " . the case against pamuk was dropped on a technicality but not before a provincial official ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books .
ankara swiftly stopped the move , wary of undermining its democratic credentials in european union eyes . in brussels eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the award a victory for " artistic freedom and for freedom of expression . " a prize for freedom of speech " it is good news for all those who want to speak , search , learn the truth , pursue dialogue , exchange thoughts and knowledge - not just in turkey but everywhere else , " the finnish commissioner said .
" artists ... need freedom of expression as desperately as life needs water and air .
orhan knows more than others how precious and fragile such freedom is . " rehn recalled pamuk telling him during his legal woes he just wanted to " write books again and free my mind from all this harassment . " pamuk 's novels , which include " snow " and " my name is red , " regularly tackle turkey 's decades-old internal struggle between islam and secularism . " in his home country , pamuk has a reputation as a social commentator even though he sees himself principally as a fiction writer with no political agenda , " the nobel jury commented . " a builder of bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier acknowledged pamuk 's cultural influence in germany , whose 2.5-million-strong turkish community is the biggest outside turkey itself , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hailed pamuk as a " builder of bridges . " he is a symbol for the wish of large parts of turkish society to become a part of europe , " said steinmeier , who supports turkey 's bid to join the eu . pamuk 's editor in france , jean mattern , said the nobel panel had rewarded " the quality of his writing and the force of his message . " his work has always tackled political and historical issues head on , " he told reporters . pamuk 's turkish publisher , iletisim , was also delighted . " we are very happy , " said academic and iletisim editor ahmet insel .
" pamuk is an important representative of the modern novel in the world , " he told ntv . of the writer 's political views , insel said : " if we take a look at the long history of the nobel literature prize , we see that the authors who won the award have made important political statements on the future of their countries and the world .

" it is great happiness for us all that a turkish writer has won such a prestigious award , " foreign minister abdullah gül told reporters at a joint press conference with his visiting afghan counterpart rangin dadfar spanta . in an apparent reference to the controversies pamuk has stirred up , gul said : " many day-to-day things are soon forgotten but the fact that a turkish writer has won the nobel award will echo throughout the world ...
it is great publicity for turkey . " " this is a historic day , " said metin celal , chairman of the turkish publishers ' union , forecasting that pamuk 's success would put turkish literature firmly on the world map . author delighted with prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was congratulated by the turkish government france , germany and the european commission also hailed the news , while pamuk himself said he was delighted . " it 's such a great honor , such a great pleasure , " pamuk told journalists at columbia university in new york .
" i think that this is first of all an honor bestowed upon the turkish language , turkish culture , turkey and also recognition of my labors ... my humble devotion to that great art of the novel . " turkey 's congratulations came despite bad blood between the establishment and the 54-year-old author , who has challenged official policies and rejected the accolade of " state artist " . the timing of the award was ironic . just hours before the swedish academy announced the award , the french parliament approved a bill making it an offense punishable by prison to deny that the ottoman turks committed genocide against armenians during world war i. pamuk himself was put on trial earlier this year for challenging the official line on the massacres , which turkey denies were genocide . pamuk praised by those who once damned him bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac was said to be delighted for pamuk french president jacques chirac said he was " delighted " that pamuk had won the nobel literature prize .
chirac said he was " particularly delighted " saying pamuk 's " reflection on society is ... intelligent , strong and liberal " . the case against pamuk was dropped on a technicality but not before a provincial official ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books .
ankara swiftly stopped the move , wary of undermining its democratic credentials in european union eyes . in brussels eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the award a victory for " artistic freedom and for freedom of expression . " a prize for freedom of speech " it is good news for all those who want to speak , search , learn the truth , pursue dialogue , exchange thoughts and knowledge - not just in turkey but everywhere else , " the finnish commissioner said .
" artists ... need freedom of expression as desperately as life needs water and air .
orhan knows more than others how precious and fragile such freedom is . " rehn recalled pamuk telling him during his legal woes he just wanted to " write books again and free my mind from all this harassment . " pamuk 's novels , which include " snow " and " my name is red , " regularly tackle turkey 's decades-old internal struggle between islam and secularism . " in his home country , pamuk has a reputation as a social commentator even though he sees himself principally as a fiction writer with no political agenda , " the nobel jury commented . " a builder of bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier acknowledged pamuk 's cultural influence in germany , whose 2.5-million-strong turkish community is the biggest outside turkey itself , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hailed pamuk as a " builder of bridges . " he is a symbol for the wish of large parts of turkish society to become a part of europe , " said steinmeier , who supports turkey 's bid to join the eu . pamuk 's editor in france , jean mattern , said the nobel panel had rewarded " the quality of his writing and the force of his message . " his work has always tackled political and historical issues head on , " he told reporters . pamuk 's turkish publisher , iletisim , was also delighted . " we are very happy , " said academic and iletisim editor ahmet insel .
" pamuk is an important representative of the modern novel in the world , " he told ntv . of the writer 's political views , insel said : " if we take a look at the long history of the nobel literature prize , we see that the authors who won the award have made important political statements on the future of their countries and the world .

" it is great happiness for us all that a turkish writer has won such a prestigious award , " foreign minister abdullah gül told reporters at a joint press conference with his visiting afghan counterpart rangin dadfar spanta . in an apparent reference to the controversies pamuk has stirred up , gul said : " many day-to-day things are soon forgotten but the fact that a turkish writer has won the nobel award will echo throughout the world ...
it is great publicity for turkey . " " this is a historic day , " said metin celal , chairman of the turkish publishers ' union , forecasting that pamuk 's success would put turkish literature firmly on the world map . author delighted with prize bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was congratulated by the turkish government france , germany and the european commission also hailed the news , while pamuk himself said he was delighted . " it 's such a great honor , such a great pleasure , " pamuk told journalists at columbia university in new york .
" i think that this is first of all an honor bestowed upon the turkish language , turkish culture , turkey and also recognition of my labors ... my humble devotion to that great art of the novel . " turkey 's congratulations came despite bad blood between the establishment and the 54-year-old author , who has challenged official policies and rejected the accolade of " state artist " . the timing of the award was ironic . just hours before the swedish academy announced the award , the french parliament approved a bill making it an offense punishable by prison to deny that the ottoman turks committed genocide against armenians during world war i. pamuk himself was put on trial earlier this year for challenging the official line on the massacres , which turkey denies were genocide . pamuk praised by those who once damned him bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac was said to be delighted for pamuk french president jacques chirac said he was " delighted " that pamuk had won the nobel literature prize .
chirac said he was " particularly delighted " saying pamuk 's " reflection on society is ... intelligent , strong and liberal " . the case against pamuk was dropped on a technicality but not before a provincial official ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books .
ankara swiftly stopped the move , wary of undermining its democratic credentials in european union eyes . in brussels eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the award a victory for " artistic freedom and for freedom of expression . " a prize for freedom of speech " it is good news for all those who want to speak , search , learn the truth , pursue dialogue , exchange thoughts and knowledge - not just in turkey but everywhere else , " the finnish commissioner said .
" artists ... need freedom of expression as desperately as life needs water and air .
orhan knows more than others how precious and fragile such freedom is . " rehn recalled pamuk telling him during his legal woes he just wanted to " write books again and free my mind from all this harassment . " pamuk 's novels , which include " snow " and " my name is red , " regularly tackle turkey 's decades-old internal struggle between islam and secularism . " in his home country , pamuk has a reputation as a social commentator even though he sees himself principally as a fiction writer with no political agenda , " the nobel jury commented . " a builder of bridges " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier acknowledged pamuk 's cultural influence in germany , whose 2.5-million-strong turkish community is the biggest outside turkey itself , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier hailed pamuk as a " builder of bridges . " he is a symbol for the wish of large parts of turkish society to become a part of europe , " said steinmeier , who supports turkey 's bid to join the eu . pamuk 's editor in france , jean mattern , said the nobel panel had rewarded " the quality of his writing and the force of his message .

it is not run by a church or foundation but by a company that views education as a product and unabashedly wants to profit from it . at first glance , the colorful and bright classrooms of the new phorms elementary school berlin-mitte just north of downtown berlin seems like any other , complete with tables and chairs , drawings and games and books . but a closer look at this spanking new elementary school in an old factory reveals distinctions : take the fact that there are fewer chairs for students , meaning the class sizes are smaller than in state schools - or the latest technology hanging on the walls , such as a " smart " blackboard that operates by computer . the most unusual differences , however , lie in the concept and management of the school : it is owned and run by a private company that offers shares , has a chief executive officer , a chief financial officer and a board of directors with a wealth of business experience .
it aims to turn a profit with its product education . national heresy ? it certainly seems like heresy in a country like germany in which even a university education is free .
when politicians wanting to shake up the country 's languishing education system proposed " elite " universities and tuition a few years ago , there was an uproar . still , private elementary and secondary schools in germany are not new even as the concept for paying for schooling is for most germans .
mostly , private schools in the past decades catered to the thousands of expatriate families , serving in the military or working in companies in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bea beste says that education is a product more recently , things are changing in the german educational landscape .
parents are inundated with studies such as the pisa one by the organization for economic development and cooperation laying out the deficiencies of the public school system - the german school system ranked near the bottom compared to its neighbors .
still , that is n't telling german parents anything they have n't already known for years , said phorms ceo bea beste . as a result , it is n't surprising that the number of students in germany attending private schools has jumped about 30 percent in the past decade , according government statistics - more than 600,000 youngsters eschewed public school in 2005 . that is something phorms is set on capitalizing on . " let 's conceive our product and establish it as a brand in germany , " said bea beste , ceo of the management company and a consultant in marketing and branding .
" the idea is to take a look at the weaknesses of the german system and offer an alternative .
our concept is n't to make a lot of money but to offer a quality product through playing by the rules of business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cfo johannes nagel expects profits in one year phorms cfo johannes nagel said that the berlin school itself - which has about 50 students in grades 1 to 5 - will turn a profit by the end of the school year .
the company is expected to be able to pay dividends in about six years .
and meanwhile , schools in munich , hamburg , frankfurt and possibly düsseldorf are planned for next year .
in 2008 , the company wants to open another five to eight schools . " education is a product that people are willing to pay for , " he said .
" we are confident that this will work . " desperate for solutions beste , one of the original founders of the school , said that the name phorms is a combination of the german word for form and metamorphosis .
this is the idea behind the company 's educational concept , she said : helping children to learn and grow . the school wants to do this by offering a language immersion program with students learning in both german and english .
it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .
and students are a diverse group with about 40 percent coming from german families and the rest either of mixed nationalities or foreign residents . what seems to most impress parents is the school 's individual focus and nurturing environment for children , enticing them to pay the sliding scale tuition that ranges from 200 to 800 euros -lrb- $ 250 to $ 1,000 -rrb- per month , based on family income . " i was desperate to find a school for my son and i did n't care what it was going to cost , " said lisa kay c. smith , an american resident whose 9-year-old son , david , attended german public school for two years .
" there was an unacceptable level of violence in the state schools and the school officials would n't deal with it .
at phorms , they take the attitude that it takes a village to raise a child and deal with issues and the child as an individual . " unethical profits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children helped prepare their own playground such opinions do n't impress the school 's critics such as josef kraus , head of the german teacher 's union . " it is unethical to profit on the backs of children , " he told der spiegel magazine . but betrand freiesleben , whose 6-year-old son , friedrich , attends the school , said he thinks differently .
he chose the school for its bilingual education , innovative and open approach and small classes .
and he said that he wants to give the school time before passing judgement . " there are some who say , ' how dare you earn money off children , " ' he said .
" but there is nothing bad about this as long as it is not the main interest .
and as far as i can tell , it is not .

" commenting on criticism , notably from financial analysts , that the problems at airbus arise largely from political interference to defend the national interests of partners and industrial jobs , bischoff commented that two big private shareholders , the german auto group daimlerchrysler and lagardere group of france , did not necessarily accept such pressures . he said : " there is no reason to assume that daimlerchrysler or lagardere group want to make sacrifices on the altar of national feelings . " factories in germany lined up for sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg could be in danger on wednesday , airbus denied a report in german newspaper bild , quoting well-informed sources , that the company wanted to sell five factories in germany employing 6,600 people . the report said that airbus wanted to sell the factories as quickly as it could to investors who would continue to operate them as suppliers to airbus but at reduced operating costs .
employees would keep their jobs but their pay would fall . however , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting on thursday that the effort of restructuring in the group should be spread evenly between france and germany . finance only one problem airbus needs solving eads has announced severe cost-saving targets to pull airbus out of a crisis arising from delays of about two years in deliveries of its star product , the a380 superjumbo airliner .
however , the company has acknowledged that it faces several other problems , notably in the way it is organized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new co-ceo gallois looks to tackle one crisis at a time in the space of two weeks , the man brought in to sort the company out , christian streiff , presented the results of an internal audit , laid down objectives and outlined a plan to achieve them ; but he then resigned after only 100 days in the job to be replaced by louis gallois , co-chief executive at eads . gallois has said that he intends to pursue the objectives , but that he will need up to three months to work out the details , commenting in germany on thursday that much press comment about the extent and location of cuts was misplaced since proposals and decisions had yet to be made . german state bank lining up bid , says paper meanwhile german government officials and the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw are preparing a contract for the bank to buy a stake in european aerospace giant eads early next year , according to the financial times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state bank kfz has made no comment the contract would be ready for signature by the end of the year , the report said , quoting one official as commenting that germany did not want a block of shares to fall into french or russian hands . german politicians are currently sending conflicting signals over the prospect of an entry by the german state into the share capital of eads . on thursday , hamburg 's mayor , ole von beust , had announced that a definite agreement had been reached , with only the concrete details yet to be worked out .
but his comments were swiftly qualified by chancellor angela merkel , who insisted that no decision had been reached , even if no single option was explicitly being ruled out . germans wary of heavy french , russian influence in its friday edition , ft quoted unnamed government officials as saying that the chancellery , finance and industry ministries had agreed on an option to buy a 7.5-percent stake in eads expected to be put up for sale by daimlerchrysler , which currently holds 22.5 percent of the aerospace firm .
the stake was valued at 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- , the newspaper said . " we do n't want that stake to end up in the hands of -lrb- french president jacques -rrb- chirac or -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin , " ft quoted one official as saying . moscow owns a stake of just over five percent via russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank and has expressed an interest in gaining a greater say in the running of eads . a government spokesman again refused to comment on the report , pointing to merkel 's comments on thursday . while the option of kfw taking over part of the daimlerchrysler stake is not seen as ideal in germany , the prospects of finding a private investor seem slim , ft said . berlin would not demand another seat on the eads supervisory board if it were indeed to acquire the stake , the newspaper continued . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks investors for eads chancellor angela merkel indicated on thursday the government was looking for private german investors to buy a stake in european aerospace company eads and help secure its future .

" commenting on criticism , notably from financial analysts , that the problems at airbus arise largely from political interference to defend the national interests of partners and industrial jobs , bischoff commented that two big private shareholders , the german auto group daimlerchrysler and lagardere group of france , did not necessarily accept such pressures . he said : " there is no reason to assume that daimlerchrysler or lagardere group want to make sacrifices on the altar of national feelings . " factories in germany lined up for sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg could be in danger on wednesday , airbus denied a report in german newspaper bild , quoting well-informed sources , that the company wanted to sell five factories in germany employing 6,600 people . the report said that airbus wanted to sell the factories as quickly as it could to investors who would continue to operate them as suppliers to airbus but at reduced operating costs .
employees would keep their jobs but their pay would fall . however , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting on thursday that the effort of restructuring in the group should be spread evenly between france and germany . finance only one problem airbus needs solving eads has announced severe cost-saving targets to pull airbus out of a crisis arising from delays of about two years in deliveries of its star product , the a380 superjumbo airliner .
however , the company has acknowledged that it faces several other problems , notably in the way it is organized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new co-ceo gallois looks to tackle one crisis at a time in the space of two weeks , the man brought in to sort the company out , christian streiff , presented the results of an internal audit , laid down objectives and outlined a plan to achieve them ; but he then resigned after only 100 days in the job to be replaced by louis gallois , co-chief executive at eads . gallois has said that he intends to pursue the objectives , but that he will need up to three months to work out the details , commenting in germany on thursday that much press comment about the extent and location of cuts was misplaced since proposals and decisions had yet to be made . german state bank lining up bid , says paper meanwhile german government officials and the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw are preparing a contract for the bank to buy a stake in european aerospace giant eads early next year , according to the financial times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state bank kfz has made no comment the contract would be ready for signature by the end of the year , the report said , quoting one official as commenting that germany did not want a block of shares to fall into french or russian hands . german politicians are currently sending conflicting signals over the prospect of an entry by the german state into the share capital of eads . on thursday , hamburg 's mayor , ole von beust , had announced that a definite agreement had been reached , with only the concrete details yet to be worked out .
but his comments were swiftly qualified by chancellor angela merkel , who insisted that no decision had been reached , even if no single option was explicitly being ruled out . germans wary of heavy french , russian influence in its friday edition , ft quoted unnamed government officials as saying that the chancellery , finance and industry ministries had agreed on an option to buy a 7.5-percent stake in eads expected to be put up for sale by daimlerchrysler , which currently holds 22.5 percent of the aerospace firm .
the stake was valued at 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- , the newspaper said . " we do n't want that stake to end up in the hands of -lrb- french president jacques -rrb- chirac or -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin , " ft quoted one official as saying . moscow owns a stake of just over five percent via russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank and has expressed an interest in gaining a greater say in the running of eads . a government spokesman again refused to comment on the report , pointing to merkel 's comments on thursday . while the option of kfw taking over part of the daimlerchrysler stake is not seen as ideal in germany , the prospects of finding a private investor seem slim , ft said . berlin would not demand another seat on the eads supervisory board if it were indeed to acquire the stake , the newspaper continued . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks investors for eads chancellor angela merkel indicated on thursday the government was looking for private german investors to buy a stake in european aerospace company eads and help secure its future .

" so far , no german university has made it into the top 50 worldwide , but if we carry out our concept for the future , after five years we could be among the first 25 , " tu president wolfgang a. herrmann told handelsblatt online portal .
developing excellence in total , 22 projects from universities , mainly in germany 's richest states , were singled out to receive a portion of the 1.9 billion euros earmarked for the initiative between 2007 and 2011 .
the money will be distributed in three areas : for graduate schools that showed they knew how to promote new talent ; for " research clusters " that demonstrated they were centers of excellence in particular fields ; and finally for three top institutions that encompassed all of the previous qualities as well as presenting a dazzling vision of a future of educational excellence .

" commenting on criticism , notably from financial analysts , that the problems at airbus arise largely from political interference to defend the national interests of partners and industrial jobs , bischoff commented that two big private shareholders , the german auto group daimlerchrysler and lagardere group of france , did not necessarily accept such pressures . he said : " there is no reason to assume that daimlerchrysler or lagardere group want to make sacrifices on the altar of national feelings . " factories in germany lined up for sale bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in hamburg could be in danger on wednesday , airbus denied a report in german newspaper bild , quoting well-informed sources , that the company wanted to sell five factories in germany employing 6,600 people . the report said that airbus wanted to sell the factories as quickly as it could to investors who would continue to operate them as suppliers to airbus but at reduced operating costs .
employees would keep their jobs but their pay would fall . however , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting on thursday that the effort of restructuring in the group should be spread evenly between france and germany . finance only one problem airbus needs solving eads has announced severe cost-saving targets to pull airbus out of a crisis arising from delays of about two years in deliveries of its star product , the a380 superjumbo airliner .
however , the company has acknowledged that it faces several other problems , notably in the way it is organized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new co-ceo gallois looks to tackle one crisis at a time in the space of two weeks , the man brought in to sort the company out , christian streiff , presented the results of an internal audit , laid down objectives and outlined a plan to achieve them ; but he then resigned after only 100 days in the job to be replaced by louis gallois , co-chief executive at eads . gallois has said that he intends to pursue the objectives , but that he will need up to three months to work out the details , commenting in germany on thursday that much press comment about the extent and location of cuts was misplaced since proposals and decisions had yet to be made . german state bank lining up bid , says paper meanwhile german government officials and the state-owned redevelopment bank kfw are preparing a contract for the bank to buy a stake in european aerospace giant eads early next year , according to the financial times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state bank kfz has made no comment the contract would be ready for signature by the end of the year , the report said , quoting one official as commenting that germany did not want a block of shares to fall into french or russian hands . german politicians are currently sending conflicting signals over the prospect of an entry by the german state into the share capital of eads . on thursday , hamburg 's mayor , ole von beust , had announced that a definite agreement had been reached , with only the concrete details yet to be worked out .
but his comments were swiftly qualified by chancellor angela merkel , who insisted that no decision had been reached , even if no single option was explicitly being ruled out . germans wary of heavy french , russian influence in its friday edition , ft quoted unnamed government officials as saying that the chancellery , finance and industry ministries had agreed on an option to buy a 7.5-percent stake in eads expected to be put up for sale by daimlerchrysler , which currently holds 22.5 percent of the aerospace firm .
the stake was valued at 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 billion -rrb- , the newspaper said . " we do n't want that stake to end up in the hands of -lrb- french president jacques -rrb- chirac or -lrb- russian president vladimir -rrb- putin , " ft quoted one official as saying . moscow owns a stake of just over five percent via russian state-owned bank vneshtorgbank and has expressed an interest in gaining a greater say in the running of eads . a government spokesman again refused to comment on the report , pointing to merkel 's comments on thursday . while the option of kfw taking over part of the daimlerchrysler stake is not seen as ideal in germany , the prospects of finding a private investor seem slim , ft said . berlin would not demand another seat on the eads supervisory board if it were indeed to acquire the stake , the newspaper continued . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany seeks investors for eads chancellor angela merkel indicated on thursday the government was looking for private german investors to buy a stake in european aerospace company eads and help secure its future .

the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .

when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .
on the contrary , officials , police and courts must be notified in cases of violence and neglect , so they can take action .

" commenting on criticism , notably from financial analysts , that the problems at airbus arise largely from political interference to defend the national interests of partners and industrial jobs , bischoff commented that two big private shareholders , the german auto group daimlerchrysler and lagardere group of france , did not necessarily accept such pressures . he said : " there is no reason to assume that daimlerchrysler or lagardere group want to make sacrifices on the altar of national feelings .

the question is : how could we have let this happen ?
all of us .
when children go hungry in a prosperous society like ours , when children are beaten in a state with a social welfare system and the rule of law , it is everyone 's problem . kevin was unlucky to have been born into a family of drug addicts .
his father was known for being prone to violence .
from the beginning , the social situation was disastrous , and then kevin 's mother died .
there were indications that she was killed by her husband .
nevertheless , kevin remained in the hands of a man who was unfit to care for a child . it was surely a failure on the part of the authorities .
bremen 's senator for social affairs , karin röpke , took the consequences and resigned .
bremen 's mayor , jens böhrnsen , had also known for months about the boy 's tragedy .
he did n't give up his office .
is he less responsible than his senator ?
whether the social welfare system in a german state , such as bremen , works is also that government 's responsibility - or is the inviolability of children merely a secondary aspect of policy ?
however , it would be too simple to hold only the representatives of bureaucracies and agencies responsible .
of course , youth welfare officers must not make such mistakes , since as their mistakes can be fatal .
but their freedom to act is limited by laws and regulations , and these are , to put it mildly , not always focused on children 's well-being .
that must be changed .
courts , officials and the police must be able to cooperate more closely and be given more space to make independent decisions when a child 's life is so obviously in danger .
others already have this discretionary power .
we do .
the neighbors of families such as the one in bremen do .
but we cop out when we see that children are neglected or beaten , abused or locked away .
there are many reasons why , but none of them are good reasons . not every screaming child is beaten , not every thin child is malnourished , not every girl or boy who has n't been seen for weeks is suffering through martyrdom .
but let 's be honest : we recognize the signs when we see or hear them .
and we still look away .
torment begins long before the very worst things take place .
kevin suffered for many months , perhaps even his entire two-year lifetime .
in other cases , a woman 's nine children disappear and no one claims to have known she had ever even been pregnant .
other parents hide their children 's corpses in a deep freezer and no claims to have noticed the children were no longer around .
it 's hard to believe . and even if no one really did notice or suspect something , it does n't make it any better .

german politicians from the left-wing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have proposed a similar initiative . " the victims have to live with the crime for their whole lives and i think it 's fair that the offenders should also have to live with it , " hamburg 's spd leader mathias petersen told bild zeitung daily on thursday . dorothee bär , a csu parliamentarian , also backs the proposal .
" the security of our children should come before data protection , " she said . kristina köhler , bär 's colleague from partner party cdu and member of the bundestag 's interior committee , added that the legal basis of the american model would have to be examined before being implemented in germany . bayreuth murder spurred " black list " proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries has spoken out against the register demands for the internet registry follow the rape and murder of a 39-year-old nurse in bayreuth . the alleged offender had been convicted of rape , kidnapping and extortionate robbery five year earlier .
though he had been sentenced to eight years in prison , he was released in september 2006 . in light of the bayreuth murder , bavarian csu leader joachim herrmann made an appeal this week for a " black list " for errant prisoner evaluators that approve the release of dangerous criminals . however , not all members of the governing coalition support an internet registry for sex offenders . drawbacks to a public registry " publishing names and addresses on the internet takes away the possibility of starting over - even after the offender has already served his time , " justice minister brigitte zypries told afp on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do open files mean privacy violation or crime prevention ?
spd parliamentarian dieter wiefelspütz said that the proposed registry would " open the shooting ground " instead of providing increased security , according to a spiegel online report .
in spring 2006 , the state of maine removed its internet registry after two registered sex offenders on the public list were shot to death . what 's more , the constitutionality of the registry has come into question . peter m. huber , a constitutional lawyer in munich called the proposal " constitutionally highly problematic " and said that sex offenders also had a " right to self-determination of information , " wrote spiegel online . young politicians demand life sentence at the other end of the spectrum members of bavaria 's youth union -lrb- ju -rrb- , a branch of the csu , have suggested that public humiliation is n't harsh enough for sex offenders . the ju advocates life-long sentences for first time sex offenders and preventative detention for violent sex offenders , said ju leader manfred weber . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german state of saxony considers public list of sex offenders saxony 's interior minister has called for a public register of sex offenders ' whereabouts after a 13-year old spent five weeks in the clutches of a man convicted for sex crimes who lived in her dresden neighborhood .
-lrb- 28.02.2006 -rrb- france tests " chemical castration " in france , doctors recently began giving chemical treatment to 48 repeat sex offenders to see if this will stop them attacking again .
but not everyone is convinced it 's the best way forward .
-lrb- 08.01.2005 -rrb- preventing new perpetrators while german programs to prevent sexual abuse of children have so far mainly focussed on awareness among parents and educators , a new project in berlin plans to offer treatment to people before they become perpetrators .
-lrb- 02.08.2004 -rrb- surveys should germany put a publicly accessible registry of sex offenders on the internet ?
yes , all sex offenders should be listed for life .
yes , but the time the sex offender is listed should correspond to the severity of the crime .
no , the public should not have access to a registry of sex offenders .

ankara swiftly stopped the move , wary of undermining its democratic credentials in european union eyes . in brussels eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called the award a victory for " artistic freedom and for freedom of expression .

it is not run by a church or foundation but by a company that views education as a product and unabashedly wants to profit from it . at first glance , the colorful and bright classrooms of the new phorms elementary school berlin-mitte just north of downtown berlin seems like any other , complete with tables and chairs , drawings and games and books . but a closer look at this spanking new elementary school in an old factory reveals distinctions : take the fact that there are fewer chairs for students , meaning the class sizes are smaller than in state schools - or the latest technology hanging on the walls , such as a " smart " blackboard that operates by computer . the most unusual differences , however , lie in the concept and management of the school : it is owned and run by a private company that offers shares , has a chief executive officer , a chief financial officer and a board of directors with a wealth of business experience .
it aims to turn a profit with its product education . national heresy ? it certainly seems like heresy in a country like germany in which even a university education is free .
when politicians wanting to shake up the country 's languishing education system proposed " elite " universities and tuition a few years ago , there was an uproar . still , private elementary and secondary schools in germany are not new even as the concept for paying for schooling is for most germans .
mostly , private schools in the past decades catered to the thousands of expatriate families , serving in the military or working in companies in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bea beste says that education is a product more recently , things are changing in the german educational landscape .
parents are inundated with studies such as the pisa one by the organization for economic development and cooperation laying out the deficiencies of the public school system - the german school system ranked near the bottom compared to its neighbors .
still , that is n't telling german parents anything they have n't already known for years , said phorms ceo bea beste . as a result , it is n't surprising that the number of students in germany attending private schools has jumped about 30 percent in the past decade , according government statistics - more than 600,000 youngsters eschewed public school in 2005 . that is something phorms is set on capitalizing on . " let 's conceive our product and establish it as a brand in germany , " said bea beste , ceo of the management company and a consultant in marketing and branding .
" the idea is to take a look at the weaknesses of the german system and offer an alternative .
our concept is n't to make a lot of money but to offer a quality product through playing by the rules of business . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cfo johannes nagel expects profits in one year phorms cfo johannes nagel said that the berlin school itself - which has about 50 students in grades 1 to 5 - will turn a profit by the end of the school year .
the company is expected to be able to pay dividends in about six years .
and meanwhile , schools in munich , hamburg , frankfurt and possibly düsseldorf are planned for next year .
in 2008 , the company wants to open another five to eight schools . " education is a product that people are willing to pay for , " he said .
" we are confident that this will work . " desperate for solutions beste , one of the original founders of the school , said that the name phorms is a combination of the german word for form and metamorphosis .
this is the idea behind the company 's educational concept , she said : helping children to learn and grow . the school wants to do this by offering a language immersion program with students learning in both german and english .
it is a full-day school unlike most in germany with after-school programs as well .
its curriculum is based on the official berlin curriculum but also the cambridge international curriculum , taught in classes of up to 20 , with two teachers present .
and students are a diverse group with about 40 percent coming from german families and the rest either of mixed nationalities or foreign residents . what seems to most impress parents is the school 's individual focus and nurturing environment for children , enticing them to pay the sliding scale tuition that ranges from 200 to 800 euros -lrb- $ 250 to $ 1,000 -rrb- per month , based on family income . " i was desperate to find a school for my son and i did n't care what it was going to cost , " said lisa kay c. smith , an american resident whose 9-year-old son , david , attended german public school for two years .
" there was an unacceptable level of violence in the state schools and the school officials would n't deal with it .
at phorms , they take the attitude that it takes a village to raise a child and deal with issues and the child as an individual . " unethical profits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children helped prepare their own playground such opinions do n't impress the school 's critics such as josef kraus , head of the german teacher 's union . " it is unethical to profit on the backs of children , " he told der spiegel magazine . but betrand freiesleben , whose 6-year-old son , friedrich , attends the school , said he thinks differently .
he chose the school for its bilingual education , innovative and open approach and small classes .
and he said that he wants to give the school time before passing judgement . " there are some who say , ' how dare you earn money off children , " ' he said .
" but there is nothing bad about this as long as it is not the main interest .
and as far as i can tell , it is not .

pierrot rajaonarivelo , who is currently in mauritius , says he will return ahead of saturday 's registration deadline .
but on thursday air mauritius refused to let him travel .
the airline was informed by madagascar that he posed a risk to it and other passengers if he landed in the country , an airport official said .
an earlier attempt by mr rajaonarivelo to return home was blocked after madagascar closed an international airport , preventing him from entering the country .
mr rajaonarivelo , who heads the opposition party arema , has been living in exile in france for the past five years .
his supporters have called for a rally at the airport in the capital , antananarivo , on saturday to meet him , they said in a statement sent to afp news agency .
mr rajaonarivelo was sentenced in august to 15 years ' hard labour for misuse of funds .
he denies the charges .
the government has said it will arrest him the moment he sets foot in madagascar .
the would-be candidate served as deputy prime minister in the government of president didier ratsiraka - who has also been in exile in paris since 2002 when the country was split in two following disputed presidential elections .

mr howard said the drought , which some experts have described as one of the worst on record in australia , would " affect our gdp growth " .
global wheat prices surged to 10-year highs earlier this week after australian officials warned the country 's harvest could be cut in half .
however , mr howard called for analysts to " keep a sense of perspective . "
" the country overall is still doing very well , " he said .
abandoned crops australian economic growth slowed to 1.9 % in the second quarter , the slowest pace in three years , although economists are expecting the economy to pick up speed in the third quarter .
mr howard said it " remained to be seen " how much effect the current drought would have on australia 's economy .
" it depends on the extent to which our booming economy in other areas can offset it , " he said .
australian crop forecasters on wednesday cut wheat production estimates for 2006/7 to 11.5 million tonnes , from 25 million a year earlier .
the country 's bureau of agricultural and resource economics last week cut winter crop forecasts by more than a third because of the extremely dry weather .
according to official figures , eastern australia has had five years of below average rainfall , and more than 90 % of new south wales , which contains sydney , is said to be suffering from drought .
reports said that farmers have abandoned crops in south australia , victoria , and new south wales .

over the last six months protests have been held in every corner of the country - leading to several of the key proposals being shelved .
but the whole premise of the reforms is to build a better health service that is easier for patients to access .
so what has gone wrong ?
why have the plans become so unpopular ?
the answer may be in the way we think of our nhs .
from blaenau ffestiniog to bronllys , llandudno to llanelli , the proposals to centralise care away from smaller hospitals have failed to convince campaigners .
opposition has lead to re-organisation in aberystwyth , haverfordwest and carmarthen being stalled , along with a decision over the future of llandudno general hospital .
' bricks and mortar ' according to mike ponton , director of the welsh nhs confederation , the message that services can be delivered differently has yet to get through .
he said : " we need to challenge the fixation with bricks and mortar , and show how the future is about services not just buildings . "
according to mr ponton , staying with the current set-up is not an option .
we have to face the realities of a changing world , and we want to exploit the opportunities we have to improve the care we provide mike ponton , welsh nhs confederation " we have to face the realities of a changing world , and we want to exploit the opportunities we have to improve the care we provide , " he added .
this includes making greater use of technology such as tele-medicine - where a patient can receive a consultation through a video-link , meaning they can be seen at their local hospital .
distance is a key issue in the whole debate , with patients concerned at the prospect of travelling further for specialist treatment , especially in an emergency .

over the last six months protests have been held in every corner of the country - leading to several of the key proposals being shelved .
but the whole premise of the reforms is to build a better health service that is easier for patients to access .
so what has gone wrong ?
why have the plans become so unpopular ?
the answer may be in the way we think of our nhs .
from blaenau ffestiniog to bronllys , llandudno to llanelli , the proposals to centralise care away from smaller hospitals have failed to convince campaigners .
opposition has lead to re-organisation in aberystwyth , haverfordwest and carmarthen being stalled , along with a decision over the future of llandudno general hospital .
' bricks and mortar ' according to mike ponton , director of the welsh nhs confederation , the message that services can be delivered differently has yet to get through .
he said : " we need to challenge the fixation with bricks and mortar , and show how the future is about services not just buildings . "
according to mr ponton , staying with the current set-up is not an option .

this includes making greater use of technology such as tele-medicine - where a patient can receive a consultation through a video-link , meaning they can be seen at their local hospital .

chief of the general staff sir richard dannatt told the daily mail that the military campaign fought in 2003 had " effectively kicked the door in " .
he also said that initial planning for the post-war period had been poor .
there are currently more than 7,000 british soldiers in iraq , based largely in basra in the south of the country .
a ministry of defence spokesman said britain had " a clear strategy " and worked with international partners " in support of the democratically elected government of iraq , under a clear un mandate . "
bbc political editor nick robinson described sir richard 's remarks as " quite extraordinary " .
he said the new head of the british army 's comments " directly contradicted so much of what the government had said " . "

in his interview , sir richard added that any initial tolerance " has largely turned to intolerance .
that is a fact " .
sir richard , who took on his role in august , also said planning for what happened after the initial successful war military offensive was " poor , probably based more on optimism than sound planning " .
' not invited in ' he said : " i do n't say that the difficulties we are experiencing round the world are caused by our presence in iraq but undoubtedly our presence in iraq exacerbates them . "
sir richard told the newspaper : " we are in a muslim country and muslims ' views of foreigners in their country are quite clear .
" as a foreigner , you can be welcomed by being invited in a country , but we were n't invited certainly by those in iraq at the time . "
he added : " whatever consent we may have had in the first place , may have turned to tolerance and has largely turned to intolerance . "
downing street issued a short statement in response to the general 's comments .
it said : " it 's important that people remember that we are in iraq at the express wish of the democratically elected iraqi government , to support them under the mandate of a un resolution . "
however , sir richard has received praise for coming forward .
major general patrick cordingly said : " i think it is a very brave thing for him to say .
i do agree .
i think there comes a time when you have got to let iraq get on and look after its own security . "
rose gentle , whose soldier son was killed in iraq , said : " i 'm just really delighted that sir richard dannatt has stood up and spoken out .
he is protecting our boys .
" we have been saying for two years this needed to happen and i think military families have done a good bit . "

there are currently more than 7,000 british soldiers in iraq , based largely in basra in the south of the country .

most of the british forces in iraq are based in basra sir richard told the newspaper : " we are in a muslim country and muslims ' views of foreigners in their country are quite clear .
" as a foreigner , you can be welcomed by being invited in a country , but we were n't invited certainly by those in iraq at the time . "

unpublished home office figures suggest 4,000 women victims of trafficking for prostitution were in the country at any one time in 2003 , an inquiry found .
the joint committee on human rights is calling for more protection for immigrants and specialist support for victims of sexual exploitation .
the home office would " look carefully " at the proposals , a spokeswoman said .
' serious human rights issue ' the committee described trafficking as " one of the most serious human rights issues in the modern world " .
official figures say between 142 and 1,420 women were trafficked to the uk in 1998 . "
of even greater concern is the lack of knowledge we have of the extent of the trafficking of young children " andrew dismore , committee chairman most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader .
the committee said that : " 10 years ago , 85 % of women in brothels were uk citizens -lsb- and -rsb- now 85 % were from outside uk " .
it also called for data on men and children trafficked for work to be compiled .
the government had to set up a national identification system and improve training in the identification of victims .
the committee 's chairman , labour mp andrew dismore , said : " the growth and extent of people trafficking into the uk is extremely worrying .
" we should recognise women trafficked for prostitution through deception , fear and violence as victims of this serious crime and not immigration offenders or criminals themselves .
" of even greater concern is the lack of knowledge we have of the extent of the trafficking of young children , for domestic servitude or , even worse , labour in the drugs trade . "
' no adequate system ' workers were often " trapped by violent and abusive employers " , he added .
daniela reale , exploited children adviser at save the children , said : " at the moment there are no adequate systems in place for these children . "
the children involved are particularly susceptible as they may not speak english , and have no one to turn to for help " natalie cronin nspcc " any child who has been trafficked will have had a deeply traumatic experience and will need crucial specialist support including safe house accommodation , access to education and basic services and support to address the trauma they have experienced . "
children 's charity nspcc also said more help was needed for children .
" child trafficking is a cruel and abhorrent form of child abuse , " nspcc head of policy and public affairs natalie cronin said .
" the children involved are particularly susceptible as they may not speak english , and have no one to turn to for help . "
the uk is a major destination for human trafficking victims , mostly women forced to work as prostitutes , the united nations says .
the committee 's report urges the government to publish research into organised crime markets .
the research is currently being conducted by the home office .
the protection of victims should be the focus of all policies , it adds .
and the government should sign and ratify the council of europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings , the report says .
a home office spokeswoman said : " the home office co-operated fully with the jchr inquiry and provided both written and oral evidence .
" we will now look carefully at the report and its recommendations . "

making films available on demand as soon as they are released at cinemas could help stop fans watching illegal copies , shaun woodward said .
" the real answer is in the technology , " he told the bbc news website , citing the success of legal music downloads .
" people will take the legal way and i think ultimately that 's the solution for film piracy as well , " he said .
film pirates in the uk make an estimated £ 300m profit a year , according to the federation against copyright theft -lrb- fact -rrb- .
most illegal gain comes from pirate dvd sales , and much is believed to help fund organised crime .
apple 's online itunes store lets us users download movies to ipods a number of major companies , including sky , bt and aol , already offer film downloads in the uk , while giants such as apple and amazon offer similar services in the us .
movies are also available on demand on tv in the uk through services such as cable provider ntl telewest and broadband broadcaster homechoice .
but no-one offers films at the same time as they are released at the cinema - whereas pirate copies usually hit the streets or the internet within days , if not hours , of their first screenings .
' more ingenious ' mr woodward told film executives at an anti-piracy campaign launch on thursday : " you 're going to have to look at release dates in a slightly different way than you have done before .
" you 're going to have to look at slightly more ingenious ways of making electronic copies available so that people may actually pay a different price for something that they can download at home , which is just being released in the cinema .
" if they want to watch it at home , then maybe you should make it available to them .
" but they should pay a premium rate for having it earlier on and it should be encrypted in such a way that it ca n't be copied . "
some gangs used film piracy to finance " some appalling organised crime around the world , which often reaches into terrorism " , he added .
downloading and watching films on a computer is increasingly easy more than 90 % of pirate dvds came from people recording films with camcorders in cinemas , a fact spokesman said .

fact chairman and sony pictures uk finance director brian robertson said mr woodward 's idea about simultaneous download and cinema releases was an " interesting suggestion " .
" at the moment it 's probably not technically possible , " he said .
" but in a few years , yes , i 'm sure it will be possible and it 's part of the whole economic model of film-making that will have to be looked at .
" it is a radical thought and the film-makers themselves may have an issue with it because they want people to experience something on the big screen , not on the small screen .

stirling university researchers said women who then worked in healthcare further increased their risk , although more research is needed to explain why .
the study raises fresh concerns about the risk posed by weed killers and chemicals containing chlorine .
however , cancer research uk said the study of 1,100 women was too small a group to draw any conclusions .
the research claimed that 137 scottish women could die each year from breast cancer brought on by their work .
those involved in the study said more work was needed to identify the link between different jobs and cancer . "
agriculture jobs tended to be among the first worked , often during adolescence " breast cancer study report but they said the research justified better control of potentially harmful chemicals .
it found that women with breast cancer were three times as likely to have grown up on a farm or worked in agriculture .
those women who then went on to work in healthcare and car manufacturing increased that risk even further - with breast cancer rates up to four times the national average .
professor andrew watterson , from the university 's occupational and environmental health research group , said the women could have worked on a range of farms , such as dairy or arable .
toxic chemicals in the uk , such as parts of east anglia , there would also be lots of young women working or growing up on farms , he said .
estimates were that about 4 % of all cancers were related to or caused by occupations , he said .
for the study , the researchers looked at women aged 55 or younger .
they analysed data from 564 women with breast cancer and 599 women in a control group .
toxic chemicals , either alone or in combination , may influence the initiation and progression of cancer .
studies have suggested that emerging breast tissue cells could be vulnerable to chemicals , researchers added .
presenting their findings , the authors said : " the results indicate that women with breast cancer were nearly three times more likely to have worked in agriculture when compared to the controls .
" although the individual contribution of automotive-related manufacturing alone was not significant , the risk for those who worked in agriculture and subsequently worked in automotive-related manufacturing was further elevated . "
scientists have also looked at whether environmental toxins might also contribute to the increase in breast cancer , but have found no conclusive link " henry scowcroft cancer research uk " the individual contribution of healthcare alone was not significant , however , the risk for those employed in agriculture and subsequently employed in healthcare was elevated .
" agriculture jobs tended to be among the first worked , often during adolescence . "
the authors said there was evidence of an association between breast cancer and some pesticides , adding that a large number of pesticides were also hormonally active .
they said nurses and other healthcare workers were potentially exposed to ionising radiation , antineoplastic drugs , anaesthetic waste gases and viruses possibly associated with cancer risk .
but henry scowcroft , the science information officer for cancer research uk , said : " this is too small a group to be able to draw any firm conclusions about a possible link . "
he added : " scientists have also looked at whether environmental toxins might also contribute to the increase in breast cancer , but have found no conclusive link . "

stirling university researchers said women who then worked in healthcare further increased their risk , although more research is needed to explain why .
the study raises fresh concerns about the risk posed by weed killers and chemicals containing chlorine .
however , cancer research uk said the study of 1,100 women was too small a group to draw any conclusions .
the research claimed that 137 scottish women could die each year from breast cancer brought on by their work .
those involved in the study said more work was needed to identify the link between different jobs and cancer .
agriculture jobs tended to be among the first worked , often during adolescence breast cancer study report but they said the research justified better control of potentially harmful chemicals .
it found that women with breast cancer were three times as likely to have grown up on a farm or worked in agriculture .
those women who then went on to work in healthcare and car manufacturing increased that risk even further - with breast cancer rates up to four times the national average .
professor andrew watterson , from the university 's occupational and environmental health research group , said the women could have worked on a range of farms , such as dairy or arable .
toxic chemicals in the uk , such as parts of east anglia , there would also be lots of young women working or growing up on farms , he said .
estimates were that about 4 % of all cancers were related to or caused by occupations , he said .
for the study , the researchers looked at women aged 55 or younger .
they analysed data from 564 women with breast cancer and 599 women in a control group .
women growing up on farms are more likely to contract the disease toxic chemicals , either alone or in combination , may influence the initiation and progression of cancer .
studies have suggested that emerging breast tissue cells could be vulnerable to chemicals , researchers added .
presenting their findings , the authors said : " the results indicate that women with breast cancer were nearly three times more likely to have worked in agriculture when compared to the controls .
" although the individual contribution of automotive-related manufacturing alone was not significant , the risk for those who worked in agriculture and subsequently worked in automotive-related manufacturing was further elevated .
scientists have also looked at whether environmental toxins might also contribute to the increase in breast cancer , but have found no conclusive link henry scowcroft cancer research uk " the individual contribution of healthcare alone was not significant , however , the risk for those employed in agriculture and subsequently employed in healthcare was elevated .
" agriculture jobs tended to be among the first worked , often during adolescence . "
the authors said there was evidence of an association between breast cancer and some pesticides , adding that a large number of pesticides were also hormonally active .
they said nurses and other healthcare workers were potentially exposed to ionising radiation , antineoplastic drugs , anaesthetic waste gases and viruses possibly associated with cancer risk .
but henry scowcroft , the science information officer for cancer research uk , said : " this is too small a group to be able to draw any firm conclusions about a possible link . "
he added : " scientists have also looked at whether environmental toxins might also contribute to the increase in breast cancer , but have found no conclusive link . "

this month sees the release of his latest work provence a-z , an encyclopaedia of provencale trivia , as well as the film a good year , based on mayle 's 2004 novel of the same name , and starring russell crowe .
your new book has been called " an alternative guidebook " to provence .
where did you get your information from ?
i 've been unconsciously doing research all the time i 've been living in provence , which is about 15 years .
i found a lot of material in the bar - all you have to do is shut up and listen and you will hear something fascinating because the people there are fairly boisterous in their conversational habits .
what was your most surprising discovery ?
one thing that sticks out is the visit i paid to the last public executioner in france , who lives in provence .
at home he had a working scale-model of the guillotine on top of his television set and a vast collection of books on torture and punishment .
i also discovered we shared the same birthday - we 're both gemini - which , as he wryly pointed out , is the only sign in the zodiac with two heads !
what 's so special about provence ?
they ca n't even make a decent cup of tea !
no , and i never order it because i know what to expect !
they tend to find comfort in more alcoholic stuff .
above all , i think it 's the light .
you get used to this wonderful shimmering light in provence , even in the winter , and it lifts the morale and it makes you feel good and optimistic .
a good year was a joint project with director ridley scott , who i understand is an old friend from your previous career in advertising ?
ridley wanted to shoot in provence because he has had a house down there for some time - and he 's interested in wine .
the wine world is a wonderful subject because it 's full of nonsense and it 's very visually rewarding .
if it was always the intention to turn the book into a film , why did you hand over the screenplay to someone else ?
one of the things i love about writing books is the independence : you work at your own speed , and do exactly what you want to do .
when a book is finished - for better or for worse , it 's published and that is the end of it .
with a screenplay , the first draft is only the beginning - everybody has ideas to throw in .
i would n't have the patience for that .
the film is an unusual project for ridley scott and leading man , russell crowe .
were you surprised by the casting ?
i was very surprised at the choice of russell , but actually he 's very engaging .
he rented a house in the area and used to go down to the local bar after work .
the locals thought he was great , although i think he was the only person they had ever met with a bodyguard .
would you say he was won over by provencale magic ?
i 'll tell you something that not many people know : russell 's second child , tennyson , was conceived while he was in provence .
and the local mayor was so delighted , he offered the little boy an honorary citizenship .

what was your most surprising discovery ?
one thing that sticks out is the visit i paid to the last public executioner in france , who lives in provence .
at home he had a working scale-model of the guillotine on top of his television set and a vast collection of books on torture and punishment .
i also discovered we shared the same birthday - we 're both gemini - which , as he wryly pointed out , is the only sign in the zodiac with two heads !
what 's so special about provence ?
they ca n't even make a decent cup of tea !
no , and i never order it because i know what to expect !
they tend to find comfort in more alcoholic stuff .
above all , i think it 's the light .
you get used to this wonderful shimmering light in provence , even in the winter , and it lifts the morale and it makes you feel good and optimistic .
a good year was a joint project with director ridley scott , who i understand is an old friend from your previous career in advertising ?
ridley wanted to shoot in provence because he has had a house down there for some time - and he 's interested in wine .
the wine world is a wonderful subject because it 's full of nonsense and it 's very visually rewarding .
if it was always the intention to turn the book into a film , why did you hand over the screenplay to someone else ?
one of the things i love about writing books is the independence : you work at your own speed , and do exactly what you want to do .
when a book is finished - for better or for worse , it 's published and that is the end of it .
with a screenplay , the first draft is only the beginning - everybody has ideas to throw in .
i would n't have the patience for that .
the film is an unusual project for ridley scott and leading man , russell crowe .
were you surprised by the casting ?
i was very surprised at the choice of russell , but actually he 's very engaging .
he rented a house in the area and used to go down to the local bar after work .
the locals thought he was great , although i think he was the only person they had ever met with a bodyguard .
would you say he was won over by provencale magic ?
i 'll tell you something that not many people know : russell 's second child , tennyson , was conceived while he was in provence .
and the local mayor was so delighted , he offered the little boy an honorary citizenship .

should the prediction turn out to be accurate , then total spend on organic and fair-trade products would have grown 62 % since 2002 .
this reflects a general change in attitudes among consumers , mintel said .
for example , three-quarters of the 1,007 consumers surveyed said that they thought it was their " duty " to recycle waste products , up from 65 % in 2002 .
higher incomes and a greater choice of products have helped boost sales of organic and fair-trade goods , mintel added .
the company said that about 70 fairtrade and organic products were launched in 2005 alone , compared with 25 in 2002 .
" ethical food suppliers have traded on the fringes of the uk grocery market for many years and until recently only a few sectors , such as free-range eggs , had really established themselves , " said julie sloan , mintel 's senior market analyst .
" but now many more ethical products have entered the mainstream-foods sector , with leading suppliers and retailers becoming increasingly involved . "

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- politics show -pipe- north west : whose lake district is it anyway ?
bbc news / politics show graphics version bbc sport home politics show -pipe- archive -pipe- contact us -pipe- faqs -pipe- interviews -pipe- meet the team -pipe- friday , 13 october 2006 , 08:23 gmt 09:23 uk north west : whose lake district is it anyway ?
michelle mayman the politics show north west this week the politics show in the northwest looks at the lake district national park authority and asks in whose interest is it acting ?
the ldnpa has a vision ...
" working together for a prosperous economy , vibrant communities and world class visitor experiences - and all sustaining the spectacular landscape " .
but many people living and working around the lakes argue that the ldnpa , the planning authority for the lakes , is stifling economic growth , ignoring the communities and could even be putting off the visitors !
the ldnpa is an independent local authority and its core funding comes from the government - £ 6.4m from defra .
the authority says its overall spend is £ 7.4m but defra says it has an annual budget of £ 11m .
the difference comes from its trading ... things like parking , planning fees and sales at its few remaining information centres .
the park authority predicts it will spend £ 176 for every person who lives in the park - or 62p per visitor .
last year it had to take some severe measures to balance the books after it predicted a £ 1m budget shortfall .
shutting doors on visitors the ldnpa decided , in a meeting behind closed doors , to shut down six of its nine tourist information offices .
this infuriated local hoteliers and guest-house owners .
the ldnpa is governed by the park 's authority board and its 26 members , none of whom , are directly elected - but some are indirectly elected .
fourteen of those appointed , are county or district councillors and the other 12 are appointed by the secretary of state .
they bring with them different skills .
some are parish councillors and others are appointed for their expertise in a particular area .
that expertise comes from years of experience - some have been on the board for 12 or 15 years - one has even been there for nearer 30 years .
but changes are mooted .
tim farron mp -lrb- lib dem westmorland -rrb- believes the board members should be directly elected .
he also believes the park authority is not flexible enough and that it needs to consider individual circumstances instead of a blanket application of the law .
it is this planning role of the ldnpa that is stirring up the most passion among local folk .
planning barriers mark weir owns the honister slate mine in borrowdale , employing 40 people in a valley where there is little alternative to the tourism industry .
he has had " run-ins " with the ldnpa going back 10 years .

this included taking on a prominent role in historic events such as the general strike of 1936 and the second world war .
perhaps their strangest function was preventing german infiltrators from interfering with the nation 's water supply in world war one .
today , their main duties are uniform patrols , crime prevention work and policing local events .

michelle mayman the politics show north west it may not get to this , but some local people feel cut off from tourists this week the politics show in the northwest looks at the lake district national park authority and asks in whose interest is it acting ?
the ldnpa has a vision ...
" working together for a prosperous economy , vibrant communities and world class visitor experiences - and all sustaining the spectacular landscape " .
but many people living and working around the lakes argue that the ldnpa , the planning authority for the lakes , is stifling economic growth , ignoring the communities and could even be putting off the visitors !
the ldnpa is an independent local authority and its core funding comes from the government - £ 6.4m from defra .
the authority says its overall spend is £ 7.4m but defra says it has an annual budget of £ 11m .
the difference comes from its trading ... things like parking , planning fees and sales at its few remaining information centres .
the park authority predicts it will spend £ 176 for every person who lives in the park - or 62p per visitor .
last year it had to take some severe measures to balance the books after it predicted a £ 1m budget shortfall .
shutting doors on visitors is funding being washed up on the shore ?
the ldnpa decided , in a meeting behind closed doors , to shut down six of its nine tourist information offices .
this infuriated local hoteliers and guest-house owners .
the ldnpa is governed by the park 's authority board and its 26 members , none of whom , are directly elected - but some are indirectly elected .
fourteen of those appointed , are county or district councillors and the other 12 are appointed by the secretary of state .
they bring with them different skills .
some are parish councillors and others are appointed for their expertise in a particular area .
that expertise comes from years of experience - some have been on the board for 12 or 15 years - one has even been there for nearer 30 years .
but changes are mooted .
tim farron mp -lrb- lib dem westmorland -rrb- believes the board members should be directly elected .
he also believes the park authority is not flexible enough and that it needs to consider individual circumstances instead of a blanket application of the law .
it is this planning role of the ldnpa that is stirring up the most passion among local folk .
planning barriers mark weir owns the honister slate mine in borrowdale , employing 40 people in a valley where there is little alternative to the tourism industry .
he has had " run-ins " with the ldnpa going back 10 years .
like many locals he was outraged when his nearest tourist information office was closed - so much so , that he offered to buy it .
he has recently succeeded in renting the former tourist office building and is in the process of re-opening it himself .
another tourist information office is being run by a co-op of locals .
could tourists become the rare breeds of the hills ?

michelle mayman the politics show north west it may not get to this , but some local people feel cut off from tourists this week the politics show in the northwest looks at the lake district national park authority and asks in whose interest is it acting ?
the ldnpa has a vision ...
" working together for a prosperous economy , vibrant communities and world class visitor experiences - and all sustaining the spectacular landscape " .
but many people living and working around the lakes argue that the ldnpa , the planning authority for the lakes , is stifling economic growth , ignoring the communities and could even be putting off the visitors !
the ldnpa is an independent local authority and its core funding comes from the government - £ 6.4m from defra .
the authority says its overall spend is £ 7.4m but defra says it has an annual budget of £ 11m .
the difference comes from its trading ... things like parking , planning fees and sales at its few remaining information centres .
the park authority predicts it will spend £ 176 for every person who lives in the park - or 62p per visitor .
last year it had to take some severe measures to balance the books after it predicted a £ 1m budget shortfall .
shutting doors on visitors is funding being washed up on the shore ?
the ldnpa decided , in a meeting behind closed doors , to shut down six of its nine tourist information offices .
this infuriated local hoteliers and guest-house owners .
the ldnpa is governed by the park 's authority board and its 26 members , none of whom , are directly elected - but some are indirectly elected .
fourteen of those appointed , are county or district councillors and the other 12 are appointed by the secretary of state .
they bring with them different skills .
some are parish councillors and others are appointed for their expertise in a particular area .
that expertise comes from years of experience - some have been on the board for 12 or 15 years - one has even been there for nearer 30 years .
but changes are mooted .
tim farron mp -lrb- lib dem westmorland -rrb- believes the board members should be directly elected .
he also believes the park authority is not flexible enough and that it needs to consider individual circumstances instead of a blanket application of the law .
it is this planning role of the ldnpa that is stirring up the most passion among local folk .
planning barriers mark weir owns the honister slate mine in borrowdale , employing 40 people in a valley where there is little alternative to the tourism industry .
he has had " run-ins " with the ldnpa going back 10 years .
like many locals he was outraged when his nearest tourist information office was closed - so much so , that he offered to buy it .
he has recently succeeded in renting the former tourist office building and is in the process of re-opening it himself .
another tourist information office is being run by a co-op of locals .
could tourists become the rare breeds of the hills ?
mark weir also fell foul of the planning rules .
he wanted to turn the shell of a derelict farmhouse on his property into a living working farmhouse .
his application was turned down .
many more people had issues with the authority decisions but were unwilling to talk on the record for fear of getting on the wrong side of the authority .
many people in the lakes argue that the ldnpa is not trying to preserve this beautiful area but is actually trying to turn back time and turn it into a museum of days gone by - ignoring the fact that life has to continue .
there is no doubt the ldnpa has a difficult job - preserving a national treasure and at the same time allowing the local people to live work and play like people anywhere else in the country .
ian soane , from the international centre for the uplands says : " i think the national park authority has got a great future if it specialises in what is unique about the national park and the lake district and that 's not just the special qualities of the lake district and landscape and biodiversity .
" it 's also how it engages with the people in the management of that resource . "
our live guests on sunday are tim farron mp , westmorland and bob cartwright director of ldnpa .
also in the programme ...
toilets - we all need them but trying to find a public one can be a difficult task .
across the country local councils have been closing their public conveniences left , right and centre because of financial constraints .
in preston city centre only two remain and the council are currently looking at what they can do to improve toilet provision .
bbc radio lancashire 's alison butterworth has been to preston in search of those elusive loos .
also ...
it takes great commitment to be a volunteer special this weekend is " national specials weekend " - three days celebrating the work of the volunteers who work alongside regular police officers dealing with local problems of crime and disorder .
this year also marks the 175th anniversary of the founding of the specials back in 1831 .
the special constables act of 1831 granted them the same " powers , authorities , advantages and immunities " as full-time constables .
this is still true today as special constables have the same powers as regular police officers .
the main difference in 1831 was that no-one could refuse to serve as a special .

it is the first time that the european socialist bloc , which includes 33 parties from across 28 european countries , has taken such a step .
although largely symbolic , it is an embarrassing political blow to the slovak prime minister , robert fico .
it is also being seen as a warning to others in europe .
the slovak social democrats keep their seats in the european parliament , but politically they are out in the cold .
mr fico , who came to power in last june 's election , will no longer be invited to the gatherings of european leaders that the party of european socialists usually hold before eu summits .
alarmed by violence the suspension will be reviewed next june , but the president of the european socialists warned that member parties could not enter government at any price , by compromising with extreme nationalism and xenophobia .
eu leaders have been alarmed at the rise in violent incidents against slovakia 's half-a-million ethnic hungarians , after mr fico brought the slovak national party into the ruling coalition .
its leader , jan slota , once urged a crowd of supporters to get into their tanks and flatten the hungarian capital budapest .
he has also made derogatory remarks about slovakia 's sizeable community of roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- .
the decision to suspend the slovak social democrats was taken by an overwhelming majority , reflecting concerns about the rise of the far-right , not only in the former communist bloc , but also in western european countries like france and belgium .

it is the first time that the european socialist bloc , which includes 33 parties from across 28 european countries , has taken such a step .
although largely symbolic , it is an embarrassing political blow to the slovak prime minister , robert fico .
it is also being seen as a warning to others in europe .
the slovak social democrats keep their seats in the european parliament , but politically they are out in the cold .
mr fico , who came to power in last june 's election , will no longer be invited to the gatherings of european leaders that the party of european socialists usually hold before eu summits .
alarmed by violence the suspension will be reviewed next june , but the president of the european socialists warned that member parties could not enter government at any price , by compromising with extreme nationalism and xenophobia .
eu leaders have been alarmed at the rise in violent incidents against slovakia 's half-a-million ethnic hungarians , after mr fico brought the slovak national party into the ruling coalition .
its leader , jan slota , once urged a crowd of supporters to get into their tanks and flatten the hungarian capital budapest .
he has also made derogatory remarks about slovakia 's sizeable community of roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- .
the decision to suspend the slovak social democrats was taken by an overwhelming majority , reflecting concerns about the rise of the far-right , not only in the former communist bloc , but also in western european countries like france and belgium .
