even as german president köhler weighed into the debate of sending german troops to congo , deutsche welle 's africa correspondent ludger schadomsky argues that the germans might be biting off more than they can chew . clearly , a european presence in the democratic republic of congo makes sense . mission artemis proved this in the east of the country in 2003 .

the debate becomes even more ridiculous when german parliamentarians fret about whether german soldiers might have to shoot child soldiers . it ’ s more than likely though that no child soldier will be seen in the command-center in potsdam in eastern germany , nor in safe gabun , where most of the troops will be deployed . the question that is most pressing is whether there are enough german soldiers in potsdam who actually speak well enough french in order to discuss a possible evacuation in kinshasa with french troops . and what happens if riots break out , before the four-month mission ends ?
according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana , it ’ s up to the lead nation to decide about an extension of the mission - that ’ ll be up to germany then . one can only imagine the scene if all hell breaks loose : coordinators get stuck at kinshasa airport , even though they should be at the hindukush in afghanistan , defending german interests there . germany in a sticky position once again : a european rapid reaction force is all very well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.03.2006 belarus opposition figure seized großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police beat protesters in the belarusian capital minsk a high-profile belarussian opposition figure was arrested following a rally in minsk saturday , a day after eu leaders slapped sanctions on president alexander lukashenko . " the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .
talking about minsk , lavrov also said he was " sure that protests like this have little chance of changing anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov sees nothing wrong in the crush of protests in belarus " these people spent several days on the square but we did n't understand what they were hoping for , " said lavrov , apparently confirming moscow 's approval of the status quo in belarus . the minister saw the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as responsible for inciting the belarus protests . " unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .
a foreign ministry spokeswoman said : " this election has shown that belarus is governed by an authoritarian regime that can not be passively observed .

" the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested .

" we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .

" unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .

" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed .

" the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .

even as german president köhler weighed into the debate of sending german troops to congo , deutsche welle 's africa correspondent ludger schadomsky argues that the germans might be biting off more than they can chew . clearly , a european presence in the democratic republic of congo makes sense . mission artemis proved this in the east of the country in 2003 .
within 24 hours the french foreign legionnaires managed to do what un-peacekeepers from uruguay had failed to accomplish in weeks : the legion disarmed militia groups in the ituri province and protected civilians from rebel attacks . concerns over malaria tablets and child soldiers but whether germany of all countries has the knowledge and experience to be the lead nation of eu-troops in drc is questionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians are worried that peacekeepers might be up against child soldiers the german army is currently more concerned about the side effects of malaria tablets and some conservative politicians only care about german resource interests in the drc .
the debate becomes even more ridiculous when german parliamentarians fret about whether german soldiers might have to shoot child soldiers . it ’ s more than likely though that no child soldier will be seen in the command-center in potsdam in eastern germany , nor in safe gabun , where most of the troops will be deployed . the question that is most pressing is whether there are enough german soldiers in potsdam who actually speak well enough french in order to discuss a possible evacuation in kinshasa with french troops . and what happens if riots break out , before the four-month mission ends ?

" we must tell them firmly no ! " he yelled at an adoring , 20,000-strong crowd bathed in a sea of the blue and white ribbons of his campaign . yanukovych 's " them " are the " oranges " - ukraine 's former opposition leaders who led mass protests when results from the presidential election in late 2004 initially gave him victory .
the supreme court eventually threw the ballot out because of massive fraud and ordered a new round of voting , won by the incumbent president viktor yushchenko . to this crowd , the " oranges " are nationalists who managed to stage a coup d 'etat and plan to forcefully " ukrainize " this traditionally russian-speaking region .
they are n't particularly liked in odessa . meanwhile 600 kilometers -lrb- 375 miles -rrb- northwest , in the towns around the western city of lviv , yulia tymoshenko was battling two " thems " at once . former pm looking to eclipse " corrupt " rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yulia tymoshenko will shed the orange this weekend tymoshenko was one of the main leaders of the " orange revolution " but split with yushchenko after he fired her as premier last september .
her " them " are yanukovych 's " forces of revanche " and yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc , whom she is battling for the " orange " electorate and whose leadership she has labeled corrupt . following her sacking , tymoshenko ditched orange paraphernalia for a red heart on a white background and ribbons and flags with the insignia flutter from trees and bushes for several kilometers along the town 's main thoroughfare . tymoshenko 's supporters believe yanukovych is part of a corrupt group of " bandits " that ruled ukraine for a decade under the previous regime and tried to hang on to power through fraud , agents of russia that 's once again trying to subjugate and " russify " ukraine . tymoshenko vows she would never join forces with such people and warns that her former " orange " comrades are considering such a union , that they 're not capable of " standing up to evil . " ukraine is europe-bound regardless of winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuriy yekhanurov says ukraine is on course for europe whoever wins the election on sunday , ukraine ’ s westwards drift towards the rest of europe will continue , according to the prime minister yuriy yekhanurov . however , in an interview with the russian daily izvestia he said that if the pro-russian opposition wins , it would slow down the process by " three or four years " , and that kiev would continue to cooperate with moscow . " if -lrb- president viktor -rrb- yushchenko 's side wins ukraine will enter europe quicker .
if the other side does , the process will be slowed down by three or four years .
but the direction will not change , " yekhanurov said . yekhanurov also said ukraine could continue to cooperate closely with russia who ever wins , especially in the energy sector .

" we must tell them firmly no ! " he yelled at an adoring , 20,000-strong crowd bathed in a sea of the blue and white ribbons of his campaign . yanukovych 's " them " are the " oranges " - ukraine 's former opposition leaders who led mass protests when results from the presidential election in late 2004 initially gave him victory .
the supreme court eventually threw the ballot out because of massive fraud and ordered a new round of voting , won by the incumbent president viktor yushchenko . to this crowd , the " oranges " are nationalists who managed to stage a coup d 'etat and plan to forcefully " ukrainize " this traditionally russian-speaking region .
they are n't particularly liked in odessa . meanwhile 600 kilometers -lrb- 375 miles -rrb- northwest , in the towns around the western city of lviv , yulia tymoshenko was battling two " thems " at once . former pm looking to eclipse " corrupt " rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yulia tymoshenko will shed the orange this weekend tymoshenko was one of the main leaders of the " orange revolution " but split with yushchenko after he fired her as premier last september .
her " them " are yanukovych 's " forces of revanche " and yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc , whom she is battling for the " orange " electorate and whose leadership she has labeled corrupt . following her sacking , tymoshenko ditched orange paraphernalia for a red heart on a white background and ribbons and flags with the insignia flutter from trees and bushes for several kilometers along the town 's main thoroughfare . tymoshenko 's supporters believe yanukovych is part of a corrupt group of " bandits " that ruled ukraine for a decade under the previous regime and tried to hang on to power through fraud , agents of russia that 's once again trying to subjugate and " russify " ukraine . tymoshenko vows she would never join forces with such people and warns that her former " orange " comrades are considering such a union , that they 're not capable of " standing up to evil . " ukraine is europe-bound regardless of winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuriy yekhanurov says ukraine is on course for europe whoever wins the election on sunday , ukraine ’ s westwards drift towards the rest of europe will continue , according to the prime minister yuriy yekhanurov . however , in an interview with the russian daily izvestia he said that if the pro-russian opposition wins , it would slow down the process by " three or four years " , and that kiev would continue to cooperate with moscow . " if -lrb- president viktor -rrb- yushchenko 's side wins ukraine will enter europe quicker .
if the other side does , the process will be slowed down by three or four years .
but the direction will not change , " yekhanurov said . yekhanurov also said ukraine could continue to cooperate closely with russia who ever wins , especially in the energy sector .
" we are interested in building an extra pipeline -lrb- between the russia-kazakhstan and ukrainian-slovakian border -rrb- , " he said . yushchenko wants victory to pursue reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko and yanukovych : bitter rivals again " as regards the eu ... ukraine should first integrate with europe 's energy system , increase the sales of its electric energy to the west , " he said . yushchenko needs his forces to gain a stable majority in parliament in order to continue reforms aimed at driving ukraine toward western clubs like the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- . although he enjoyed the backing of 70 percent of his countrymen when he assumed power in january 2005 , the slowing economy and infighting within his forces has eroded their support . economy a hot topic in sunday 's poll the state of ukraine 's economy is a hotly debated issue , with one side saying it 's in dire straits , the other that it 's never been better . yanukovych paints a bleak economic picture , blaming his rival yushchenko for the downturn which followed his election .
" economic policies of these authorities can only be called financial recklessness and economic irresponsibility , " he said recently in kiev .
yushchenko unsurprisingly , says the economy is in good shape . however , his promise of turning ukraine into a new investment paradise has not borne fruit , mostly because investors became wary of the government of his former " orange revolution " partner tymoshenko and her vows to review past questionable privatizations , and because investors were waiting to see the nation 's political landscape after this weekend 's parliamentary poll . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine boxing hero eyes political title in kiev vitali klitschko , the former wbc heavyweight champion and one of ukraine 's most popular public figures , is running for the post of mayor of kiev in march elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.03.2006 opinion : is germany fit to lead peacekeepers in congo ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would an eu mission in congo do more harm than good ?
even as german president köhler weighed into the debate of sending german troops to congo , deutsche welle 's africa correspondent ludger schadomsky argues that the germans might be biting off more than they can chew . clearly , a european presence in the democratic republic of congo makes sense . mission artemis proved this in the east of the country in 2003 .
within 24 hours the french foreign legionnaires managed to do what un-peacekeepers from uruguay had failed to accomplish in weeks : the legion disarmed militia groups in the ituri province and protected civilians from rebel attacks . concerns over malaria tablets and child soldiers but whether germany of all countries has the knowledge and experience to be the lead nation of eu-troops in drc is questionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians are worried that peacekeepers might be up against child soldiers the german army is currently more concerned about the side effects of malaria tablets and some conservative politicians only care about german resource interests in the drc .
the debate becomes even more ridiculous when german parliamentarians fret about whether german soldiers might have to shoot child soldiers . it ’ s more than likely though that no child soldier will be seen in the command-center in potsdam in eastern germany , nor in safe gabun , where most of the troops will be deployed . the question that is most pressing is whether there are enough german soldiers in potsdam who actually speak well enough french in order to discuss a possible evacuation in kinshasa with french troops . and what happens if riots break out , before the four-month mission ends ?
according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana , it ’ s up to the lead nation to decide about an extension of the mission - that ’ ll be up to germany then . one can only imagine the scene if all hell breaks loose : coordinators get stuck at kinshasa airport , even though they should be at the hindukush in afghanistan , defending german interests there . germany in a sticky position once again : a european rapid reaction force is all very well .
but 1500 soldiers who will be mainly deployed in a neighboring country simply are a farce and an embarrassment for the self-proclaimed super-power eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has bowed in to chirac 's desire to see germany take a leading role in congo german chancellor angela merkel who has little to no knowledge about africa has been tricked by the cunning fox jacques chirac into taking over the role as lead nation .
chirac who of course still plays colonial master in some parts of africa , now has germany to do the donkey work for him there . a withdrawal from the mission is hardly possible anymore . more harm than good ? let ’ s take a look back .

the debate becomes even more ridiculous when german parliamentarians fret about whether german soldiers might have to shoot child soldiers . it ’ s more than likely though that no child soldier will be seen in the command-center in potsdam in eastern germany , nor in safe gabun , where most of the troops will be deployed . the question that is most pressing is whether there are enough german soldiers in potsdam who actually speak well enough french in order to discuss a possible evacuation in kinshasa with french troops . and what happens if riots break out , before the four-month mission ends ?
according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana , it ’ s up to the lead nation to decide about an extension of the mission - that ’ ll be up to germany then . one can only imagine the scene if all hell breaks loose : coordinators get stuck at kinshasa airport , even though they should be at the hindukush in afghanistan , defending german interests there . germany in a sticky position once again : a european rapid reaction force is all very well .

43 years ago was the last time a german soldier fought in the congo : the legendary mercenary soldier siegfried müller , also known as congo-müller , of course was a disgrace - he drove around with the scull of a rebel on his jeep . however , experts have long been discussing the option of using mercenaries .
because one thing is clear : an overstretched and inexperienced german lead nation can do more harm than good .
drc already has enough problems , it doesn ’ t need the so-called help of foreign troops who will barely be able to help themselves . maybe it wasn ’ t a coincidence that on his last visit to germany the drc ’ s foreign minister raymond baya said he didn ’ t know anything about a planned eu mission to congo . maybe he was just trying to give a broad hint . ludger schadomsky -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu states agree on congo peacekeeping mission the european union has agreed to send a small peacekeeping force to secure upcoming elections in the democratic republic of congo .
germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain .
-lrb- march 23 , 2006 -rrb- german parliamentarians voice opposition to congo mission germany 's foreign minister has declared that german troops are ready to lead an eu mission in the democratic republic of congo , but if critics from within the government have their way , that wo n't be the last word .
-lrb- march 22 , 2006 -rrb- merkel prepared to send troops to congo , reports say according to german newspaper reports , chancellor angela merkel is willing to send troops to the democratic republic of congo to help with planned elections in the war-ravaged country .

" the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .
talking about minsk , lavrov also said he was " sure that protests like this have little chance of changing anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov sees nothing wrong in the crush of protests in belarus " these people spent several days on the square but we did n't understand what they were hoping for , " said lavrov , apparently confirming moscow 's approval of the status quo in belarus . the minister saw the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as responsible for inciting the belarus protests . " unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .

" the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .

" unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .

the debate becomes even more ridiculous when german parliamentarians fret about whether german soldiers might have to shoot child soldiers . it ’ s more than likely though that no child soldier will be seen in the command-center in potsdam in eastern germany , nor in safe gabun , where most of the troops will be deployed . the question that is most pressing is whether there are enough german soldiers in potsdam who actually speak well enough french in order to discuss a possible evacuation in kinshasa with french troops . and what happens if riots break out , before the four-month mission ends ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.03.2006 opinion : is germany fit to lead peacekeepers in congo ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would an eu mission in congo do more harm than good ?
even as german president köhler weighed into the debate of sending german troops to congo , deutsche welle 's africa correspondent ludger schadomsky argues that the germans might be biting off more than they can chew . clearly , a european presence in the democratic republic of congo makes sense . mission artemis proved this in the east of the country in 2003 .
within 24 hours the french foreign legionnaires managed to do what un-peacekeepers from uruguay had failed to accomplish in weeks : the legion disarmed militia groups in the ituri province and protected civilians from rebel attacks . concerns over malaria tablets and child soldiers but whether germany of all countries has the knowledge and experience to be the lead nation of eu-troops in drc is questionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians are worried that peacekeepers might be up against child soldiers the german army is currently more concerned about the side effects of malaria tablets and some conservative politicians only care about german resource interests in the drc .
the debate becomes even more ridiculous when german parliamentarians fret about whether german soldiers might have to shoot child soldiers . it ’ s more than likely though that no child soldier will be seen in the command-center in potsdam in eastern germany , nor in safe gabun , where most of the troops will be deployed . the question that is most pressing is whether there are enough german soldiers in potsdam who actually speak well enough french in order to discuss a possible evacuation in kinshasa with french troops . and what happens if riots break out , before the four-month mission ends ?
according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana , it ’ s up to the lead nation to decide about an extension of the mission - that ’ ll be up to germany then . one can only imagine the scene if all hell breaks loose : coordinators get stuck at kinshasa airport , even though they should be at the hindukush in afghanistan , defending german interests there . germany in a sticky position once again : a european rapid reaction force is all very well .
but 1500 soldiers who will be mainly deployed in a neighboring country simply are a farce and an embarrassment for the self-proclaimed super-power eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has bowed in to chirac 's desire to see germany take a leading role in congo german chancellor angela merkel who has little to no knowledge about africa has been tricked by the cunning fox jacques chirac into taking over the role as lead nation .
chirac who of course still plays colonial master in some parts of africa , now has germany to do the donkey work for him there . a withdrawal from the mission is hardly possible anymore . more harm than good ? let ’ s take a look back .
43 years ago was the last time a german soldier fought in the congo : the legendary mercenary soldier siegfried müller , also known as congo-müller , of course was a disgrace - he drove around with the scull of a rebel on his jeep . however , experts have long been discussing the option of using mercenaries .
because one thing is clear : an overstretched and inexperienced german lead nation can do more harm than good .
drc already has enough problems , it doesn ’ t need the so-called help of foreign troops who will barely be able to help themselves . maybe it wasn ’ t a coincidence that on his last visit to germany the drc ’ s foreign minister raymond baya said he didn ’ t know anything about a planned eu mission to congo . maybe he was just trying to give a broad hint . ludger schadomsky -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu states agree on congo peacekeeping mission the european union has agreed to send a small peacekeeping force to secure upcoming elections in the democratic republic of congo .
germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain .
-lrb- march 23 , 2006 -rrb- german parliamentarians voice opposition to congo mission germany 's foreign minister has declared that german troops are ready to lead an eu mission in the democratic republic of congo , but if critics from within the government have their way , that wo n't be the last word .

" we must tell them firmly no ! " he yelled at an adoring , 20,000-strong crowd bathed in a sea of the blue and white ribbons of his campaign . yanukovych 's " them " are the " oranges " - ukraine 's former opposition leaders who led mass protests when results from the presidential election in late 2004 initially gave him victory .
the supreme court eventually threw the ballot out because of massive fraud and ordered a new round of voting , won by the incumbent president viktor yushchenko . to this crowd , the " oranges " are nationalists who managed to stage a coup d 'etat and plan to forcefully " ukrainize " this traditionally russian-speaking region .
they are n't particularly liked in odessa . meanwhile 600 kilometers -lrb- 375 miles -rrb- northwest , in the towns around the western city of lviv , yulia tymoshenko was battling two " thems " at once . former pm looking to eclipse " corrupt " rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yulia tymoshenko will shed the orange this weekend tymoshenko was one of the main leaders of the " orange revolution " but split with yushchenko after he fired her as premier last september .
her " them " are yanukovych 's " forces of revanche " and yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc , whom she is battling for the " orange " electorate and whose leadership she has labeled corrupt . following her sacking , tymoshenko ditched orange paraphernalia for a red heart on a white background and ribbons and flags with the insignia flutter from trees and bushes for several kilometers along the town 's main thoroughfare . tymoshenko 's supporters believe yanukovych is part of a corrupt group of " bandits " that ruled ukraine for a decade under the previous regime and tried to hang on to power through fraud , agents of russia that 's once again trying to subjugate and " russify " ukraine . tymoshenko vows she would never join forces with such people and warns that her former " orange " comrades are considering such a union , that they 're not capable of " standing up to evil . " ukraine is europe-bound regardless of winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuriy yekhanurov says ukraine is on course for europe whoever wins the election on sunday , ukraine ’ s westwards drift towards the rest of europe will continue , according to the prime minister yuriy yekhanurov . however , in an interview with the russian daily izvestia he said that if the pro-russian opposition wins , it would slow down the process by " three or four years " , and that kiev would continue to cooperate with moscow . " if -lrb- president viktor -rrb- yushchenko 's side wins ukraine will enter europe quicker .
if the other side does , the process will be slowed down by three or four years .
but the direction will not change , " yekhanurov said . yekhanurov also said ukraine could continue to cooperate closely with russia who ever wins , especially in the energy sector .
" we are interested in building an extra pipeline -lrb- between the russia-kazakhstan and ukrainian-slovakian border -rrb- , " he said . yushchenko wants victory to pursue reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko and yanukovych : bitter rivals again " as regards the eu ... ukraine should first integrate with europe 's energy system , increase the sales of its electric energy to the west , " he said . yushchenko needs his forces to gain a stable majority in parliament in order to continue reforms aimed at driving ukraine toward western clubs like the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- . although he enjoyed the backing of 70 percent of his countrymen when he assumed power in january 2005 , the slowing economy and infighting within his forces has eroded their support . economy a hot topic in sunday 's poll the state of ukraine 's economy is a hotly debated issue , with one side saying it 's in dire straits , the other that it 's never been better . yanukovych paints a bleak economic picture , blaming his rival yushchenko for the downturn which followed his election .
" economic policies of these authorities can only be called financial recklessness and economic irresponsibility , " he said recently in kiev .
yushchenko unsurprisingly , says the economy is in good shape . however , his promise of turning ukraine into a new investment paradise has not borne fruit , mostly because investors became wary of the government of his former " orange revolution " partner tymoshenko and her vows to review past questionable privatizations , and because investors were waiting to see the nation 's political landscape after this weekend 's parliamentary poll . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine boxing hero eyes political title in kiev vitali klitschko , the former wbc heavyweight champion and one of ukraine 's most popular public figures , is running for the post of mayor of kiev in march elections .

and that despite receiving nationwide recognition this week for her participation in an integration project . " it 's horrible , first you 're honored , then you 're deported , " she said .
" what are they thinking , tearing a family apart that 's lived here for 17 years , and can speak german ?
it 's incomprehensible that we ’ re being deported at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a repressed minority in turkey , a number of kurds have fled to europe exception made for three family members for the time being , an exception made by berlin 's interior senator ehrhart körting will allow hayriye and two of her sisters to remain in germany , while her parents and four younger siblings are deported . " i made an exception for the three older sisters to remain here , at least until they have completed their final school exams , " he said .
" if they complete their exams successfully , and can live independently in germany , then they can certainly stay here in the future .
for the parents and other family members , i did n't feel i could justify making an exception . " a group of hayriye 's teachers and friends ' parents guaranteed to pay the girls ' expenses and started a petition to allow the entire family to remain in germany . in 1989 , when the aydin family first arrived in germany , they were denied asylum seeker status and procured false documents to stay in the country for 17 years .
feyyaz aydin , hayriye 's father , said he resorted to lying to german officials because he feared being sent back to turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said he would examine the situation of illegal refugees in germany family " embodies concept of integration " the committee on petitions at the state parliament in berlin , is investigating whether or not the aydins could be allowed to stay in germany .
gerd fitkau , one of the members of the german parliament looking into the case , said he does n't feel anyone in the family should be deported . " the aydins really embody the concept of integration , " he said .

" we must tell them firmly no ! " he yelled at an adoring , 20,000-strong crowd bathed in a sea of the blue and white ribbons of his campaign . yanukovych 's " them " are the " oranges " - ukraine 's former opposition leaders who led mass protests when results from the presidential election in late 2004 initially gave him victory .
the supreme court eventually threw the ballot out because of massive fraud and ordered a new round of voting , won by the incumbent president viktor yushchenko . to this crowd , the " oranges " are nationalists who managed to stage a coup d 'etat and plan to forcefully " ukrainize " this traditionally russian-speaking region .
they are n't particularly liked in odessa . meanwhile 600 kilometers -lrb- 375 miles -rrb- northwest , in the towns around the western city of lviv , yulia tymoshenko was battling two " thems " at once . former pm looking to eclipse " corrupt " rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yulia tymoshenko will shed the orange this weekend tymoshenko was one of the main leaders of the " orange revolution " but split with yushchenko after he fired her as premier last september .
her " them " are yanukovych 's " forces of revanche " and yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc , whom she is battling for the " orange " electorate and whose leadership she has labeled corrupt . following her sacking , tymoshenko ditched orange paraphernalia for a red heart on a white background and ribbons and flags with the insignia flutter from trees and bushes for several kilometers along the town 's main thoroughfare . tymoshenko 's supporters believe yanukovych is part of a corrupt group of " bandits " that ruled ukraine for a decade under the previous regime and tried to hang on to power through fraud , agents of russia that 's once again trying to subjugate and " russify " ukraine . tymoshenko vows she would never join forces with such people and warns that her former " orange " comrades are considering such a union , that they 're not capable of " standing up to evil . " ukraine is europe-bound regardless of winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuriy yekhanurov says ukraine is on course for europe whoever wins the election on sunday , ukraine ’ s westwards drift towards the rest of europe will continue , according to the prime minister yuriy yekhanurov . however , in an interview with the russian daily izvestia he said that if the pro-russian opposition wins , it would slow down the process by " three or four years " , and that kiev would continue to cooperate with moscow . " if -lrb- president viktor -rrb- yushchenko 's side wins ukraine will enter europe quicker .
if the other side does , the process will be slowed down by three or four years .
but the direction will not change , " yekhanurov said . yekhanurov also said ukraine could continue to cooperate closely with russia who ever wins , especially in the energy sector .
" we are interested in building an extra pipeline -lrb- between the russia-kazakhstan and ukrainian-slovakian border -rrb- , " he said . yushchenko wants victory to pursue reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko and yanukovych : bitter rivals again " as regards the eu ... ukraine should first integrate with europe 's energy system , increase the sales of its electric energy to the west , " he said . yushchenko needs his forces to gain a stable majority in parliament in order to continue reforms aimed at driving ukraine toward western clubs like the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- . although he enjoyed the backing of 70 percent of his countrymen when he assumed power in january 2005 , the slowing economy and infighting within his forces has eroded their support . economy a hot topic in sunday 's poll the state of ukraine 's economy is a hotly debated issue , with one side saying it 's in dire straits , the other that it 's never been better . yanukovych paints a bleak economic picture , blaming his rival yushchenko for the downturn which followed his election .
" economic policies of these authorities can only be called financial recklessness and economic irresponsibility , " he said recently in kiev .
yushchenko unsurprisingly , says the economy is in good shape . however , his promise of turning ukraine into a new investment paradise has not borne fruit , mostly because investors became wary of the government of his former " orange revolution " partner tymoshenko and her vows to review past questionable privatizations , and because investors were waiting to see the nation 's political landscape after this weekend 's parliamentary poll . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine boxing hero eyes political title in kiev vitali klitschko , the former wbc heavyweight champion and one of ukraine 's most popular public figures , is running for the post of mayor of kiev in march elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.03.2006 belarus opposition figure seized großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police beat protesters in the belarusian capital minsk a high-profile belarussian opposition figure was arrested following a rally in minsk saturday , a day after eu leaders slapped sanctions on president alexander lukashenko . " the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .
talking about minsk , lavrov also said he was " sure that protests like this have little chance of changing anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov sees nothing wrong in the crush of protests in belarus " these people spent several days on the square but we did n't understand what they were hoping for , " said lavrov , apparently confirming moscow 's approval of the status quo in belarus . the minister saw the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as responsible for inciting the belarus protests . " unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .
a foreign ministry spokeswoman said : " this election has shown that belarus is governed by an authoritarian regime that can not be passively observed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.03.2006 belarus opposition figure seized großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police beat protesters in the belarusian capital minsk a high-profile belarussian opposition figure was arrested following a rally in minsk saturday , a day after eu leaders slapped sanctions on president alexander lukashenko . " the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .
talking about minsk , lavrov also said he was " sure that protests like this have little chance of changing anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov sees nothing wrong in the crush of protests in belarus " these people spent several days on the square but we did n't understand what they were hoping for , " said lavrov , apparently confirming moscow 's approval of the status quo in belarus . the minister saw the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as responsible for inciting the belarus protests . " unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .
a foreign ministry spokeswoman said : " this election has shown that belarus is governed by an authoritarian regime that can not be passively observed .

now , a soccer park is to be built in front of parliament for fans to watch and play the beautiful game during the event . before german politicians returned to berlin from bonn and reclaimed the reichstag or parliament in 1999 , the grassy patch in front of one germany 's most historical landmarks was a meeting point where people could get out and enjoy a bit of green in the asphalt jungle of the city . one beloved activity was playing soccer - something that politicians decided was unworthy of republic square , the official name of the area in front of the parliament .
playing ball was prohibited . now that 's set to change during the upcoming world cup in germany .
the city of berlin last week provided relief for the thousands of fans who will be unable to get their hands on tickets for any of the matches , let alone for the six in berlin , including the final : sportswear giant adidas , which has been searching for a proper location in berlin for almost a year , has said it will build a " 13th world cup venue " on republic square . for the city which lost austrian artist andre heller 's glittering opening ceremony after a lawn dispute with fifa at the real berlin world cup venue , it can provide an interesting alternative to just watching matches in bars or at home to soccer supporters from around the world . " for those unable to get tickets for a world cup game , it offers the chance to soak up the atmosphere , " said berlin mayor klaus wowereit . mini-stadium to attract huge crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real olympic stadium will host the world cup final on july 9 the stadium is to be a replica of berlin 's olympic stadium on a scale of 1:3.3 .
up to 10,000 fans can sit in the arena which adidas said will cost tens of million of euros to build .
all 64 world cup games are to be broadcast on giant screens on the grounds at the reichstag .
adidas expects up to 70,000 visitors per day . yet the action will not be limited to passive spectating .
around the stadium , soccer fields will be set up .
tournaments are supposed to be held .
schools are encouraged to take field trips to the park and play soccer .
also , no world cup in germany would be complete without a beer garden .
the public in general should have a good time . even on those few days when soccer players and fans have the day off from the tournament , the mini-stadium will host concerts .
us hip-hop group " the black eyed peas " are scheduled for june 28 .
english singer-songwriter james blunt is scheduled to perform on july 7 . final match pitch to be sold to general public adidas also does not want to chase people away by charging high ticket prices .
the cost to get into the soccer park will be one euro and just three euros to get into the stadium , excluding concerts of course .
all proceeds will go to charity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hopes to generate an atmosphere similar to christo 's wrapped reichstag project when the world cup is over , the cherished grass in front of the reichstag will be replaced . finally , for those fanatics who feel that being at the finals is the only true way to feel the fervor but still ca n't get their hands on those elusive tickets , they can at least smell the grass . this year , for the first time ever , the general public can purchase a potential piece of soccer history - they can already reserve a section of the final match pitch .
german mail-order house quelle has the rights to sell the pitch patches .
the cost : a modest 75 euros . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians incensed over gala cancellation now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .

" the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .
talking about minsk , lavrov also said he was " sure that protests like this have little chance of changing anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov sees nothing wrong in the crush of protests in belarus " these people spent several days on the square but we did n't understand what they were hoping for , " said lavrov , apparently confirming moscow 's approval of the status quo in belarus . the minister saw the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as responsible for inciting the belarus protests . " unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .
a foreign ministry spokeswoman said : " this election has shown that belarus is governed by an authoritarian regime that can not be passively observed .

more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .
talking about minsk , lavrov also said he was " sure that protests like this have little chance of changing anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov sees nothing wrong in the crush of protests in belarus " these people spent several days on the square but we did n't understand what they were hoping for , " said lavrov , apparently confirming moscow 's approval of the status quo in belarus . the minister saw the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as responsible for inciting the belarus protests . " unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .
a foreign ministry spokeswoman said : " this election has shown that belarus is governed by an authoritarian regime that can not be passively observed .

even as german president köhler weighed into the debate of sending german troops to congo , deutsche welle 's africa correspondent ludger schadomsky argues that the germans might be biting off more than they can chew . clearly , a european presence in the democratic republic of congo makes sense . mission artemis proved this in the east of the country in 2003 .
within 24 hours the french foreign legionnaires managed to do what un-peacekeepers from uruguay had failed to accomplish in weeks : the legion disarmed militia groups in the ituri province and protected civilians from rebel attacks . concerns over malaria tablets and child soldiers but whether germany of all countries has the knowledge and experience to be the lead nation of eu-troops in drc is questionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians are worried that peacekeepers might be up against child soldiers the german army is currently more concerned about the side effects of malaria tablets and some conservative politicians only care about german resource interests in the drc .
the debate becomes even more ridiculous when german parliamentarians fret about whether german soldiers might have to shoot child soldiers . it ’ s more than likely though that no child soldier will be seen in the command-center in potsdam in eastern germany , nor in safe gabun , where most of the troops will be deployed . the question that is most pressing is whether there are enough german soldiers in potsdam who actually speak well enough french in order to discuss a possible evacuation in kinshasa with french troops . and what happens if riots break out , before the four-month mission ends ?
according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana , it ’ s up to the lead nation to decide about an extension of the mission - that ’ ll be up to germany then . one can only imagine the scene if all hell breaks loose : coordinators get stuck at kinshasa airport , even though they should be at the hindukush in afghanistan , defending german interests there . germany in a sticky position once again : a european rapid reaction force is all very well .
but 1500 soldiers who will be mainly deployed in a neighboring country simply are a farce and an embarrassment for the self-proclaimed super-power eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has bowed in to chirac 's desire to see germany take a leading role in congo german chancellor angela merkel who has little to no knowledge about africa has been tricked by the cunning fox jacques chirac into taking over the role as lead nation .
chirac who of course still plays colonial master in some parts of africa , now has germany to do the donkey work for him there . a withdrawal from the mission is hardly possible anymore . more harm than good ? let ’ s take a look back .
43 years ago was the last time a german soldier fought in the congo : the legendary mercenary soldier siegfried müller , also known as congo-müller , of course was a disgrace - he drove around with the scull of a rebel on his jeep . however , experts have long been discussing the option of using mercenaries .
because one thing is clear : an overstretched and inexperienced german lead nation can do more harm than good .
drc already has enough problems , it doesn ’ t need the so-called help of foreign troops who will barely be able to help themselves . maybe it wasn ’ t a coincidence that on his last visit to germany the drc ’ s foreign minister raymond baya said he didn ’ t know anything about a planned eu mission to congo . maybe he was just trying to give a broad hint . ludger schadomsky -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu states agree on congo peacekeeping mission the european union has agreed to send a small peacekeeping force to secure upcoming elections in the democratic republic of congo .
germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain .
-lrb- march 23 , 2006 -rrb- german parliamentarians voice opposition to congo mission germany 's foreign minister has declared that german troops are ready to lead an eu mission in the democratic republic of congo , but if critics from within the government have their way , that wo n't be the last word .
-lrb- march 22 , 2006 -rrb- merkel prepared to send troops to congo , reports say according to german newspaper reports , chancellor angela merkel is willing to send troops to the democratic republic of congo to help with planned elections in the war-ravaged country .

" the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .
talking about minsk , lavrov also said he was " sure that protests like this have little chance of changing anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov sees nothing wrong in the crush of protests in belarus " these people spent several days on the square but we did n't understand what they were hoping for , " said lavrov , apparently confirming moscow 's approval of the status quo in belarus . the minister saw the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as responsible for inciting the belarus protests . " unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .

" the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested .

" we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .

" unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .

" the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .

now , a soccer park is to be built in front of parliament for fans to watch and play the beautiful game during the event . before german politicians returned to berlin from bonn and reclaimed the reichstag or parliament in 1999 , the grassy patch in front of one germany 's most historical landmarks was a meeting point where people could get out and enjoy a bit of green in the asphalt jungle of the city . one beloved activity was playing soccer - something that politicians decided was unworthy of republic square , the official name of the area in front of the parliament .
playing ball was prohibited . now that 's set to change during the upcoming world cup in germany .
the city of berlin last week provided relief for the thousands of fans who will be unable to get their hands on tickets for any of the matches , let alone for the six in berlin , including the final : sportswear giant adidas , which has been searching for a proper location in berlin for almost a year , has said it will build a " 13th world cup venue " on republic square . for the city which lost austrian artist andre heller 's glittering opening ceremony after a lawn dispute with fifa at the real berlin world cup venue , it can provide an interesting alternative to just watching matches in bars or at home to soccer supporters from around the world . " for those unable to get tickets for a world cup game , it offers the chance to soak up the atmosphere , " said berlin mayor klaus wowereit . mini-stadium to attract huge crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real olympic stadium will host the world cup final on july 9 the stadium is to be a replica of berlin 's olympic stadium on a scale of 1:3.3 .
up to 10,000 fans can sit in the arena which adidas said will cost tens of million of euros to build .
all 64 world cup games are to be broadcast on giant screens on the grounds at the reichstag .
adidas expects up to 70,000 visitors per day . yet the action will not be limited to passive spectating .
around the stadium , soccer fields will be set up .
tournaments are supposed to be held .
schools are encouraged to take field trips to the park and play soccer .
also , no world cup in germany would be complete without a beer garden .
the public in general should have a good time . even on those few days when soccer players and fans have the day off from the tournament , the mini-stadium will host concerts .
us hip-hop group " the black eyed peas " are scheduled for june 28 .
english singer-songwriter james blunt is scheduled to perform on july 7 . final match pitch to be sold to general public adidas also does not want to chase people away by charging high ticket prices .
the cost to get into the soccer park will be one euro and just three euros to get into the stadium , excluding concerts of course .
all proceeds will go to charity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hopes to generate an atmosphere similar to christo 's wrapped reichstag project when the world cup is over , the cherished grass in front of the reichstag will be replaced . finally , for those fanatics who feel that being at the finals is the only true way to feel the fervor but still ca n't get their hands on those elusive tickets , they can at least smell the grass . this year , for the first time ever , the general public can purchase a potential piece of soccer history - they can already reserve a section of the final match pitch .
german mail-order house quelle has the rights to sell the pitch patches .
the cost : a modest 75 euros . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians incensed over gala cancellation now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .

and that despite receiving nationwide recognition this week for her participation in an integration project . " it 's horrible , first you 're honored , then you 're deported , " she said .
" what are they thinking , tearing a family apart that 's lived here for 17 years , and can speak german ?
it 's incomprehensible that we ’ re being deported at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a repressed minority in turkey , a number of kurds have fled to europe exception made for three family members for the time being , an exception made by berlin 's interior senator ehrhart körting will allow hayriye and two of her sisters to remain in germany , while her parents and four younger siblings are deported . " i made an exception for the three older sisters to remain here , at least until they have completed their final school exams , " he said .
" if they complete their exams successfully , and can live independently in germany , then they can certainly stay here in the future .
for the parents and other family members , i did n't feel i could justify making an exception . " a group of hayriye 's teachers and friends ' parents guaranteed to pay the girls ' expenses and started a petition to allow the entire family to remain in germany . in 1989 , when the aydin family first arrived in germany , they were denied asylum seeker status and procured false documents to stay in the country for 17 years .
feyyaz aydin , hayriye 's father , said he resorted to lying to german officials because he feared being sent back to turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said he would examine the situation of illegal refugees in germany family " embodies concept of integration " the committee on petitions at the state parliament in berlin , is investigating whether or not the aydins could be allowed to stay in germany .
gerd fitkau , one of the members of the german parliament looking into the case , said he does n't feel anyone in the family should be deported . " the aydins really embody the concept of integration , " he said .
" there are 11 children , including hayriye , who despite being a muslim , campaigned in a berlin initiative against anti-semitism .
the children are all active in school , as class representatives , and pupil-teacher mediators . " german president horst köhler has promised to personally look into the aydin case , although he stressed that he could n't make any promises .
köhler also said he would investigate difficulties with the right of residence for families who have lived as illegal long-term refugees in germany . jane conway -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .

and that despite receiving nationwide recognition this week for her participation in an integration project . " it 's horrible , first you 're honored , then you 're deported , " she said .
" what are they thinking , tearing a family apart that 's lived here for 17 years , and can speak german ?
it 's incomprehensible that we ’ re being deported at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a repressed minority in turkey , a number of kurds have fled to europe exception made for three family members for the time being , an exception made by berlin 's interior senator ehrhart körting will allow hayriye and two of her sisters to remain in germany , while her parents and four younger siblings are deported . " i made an exception for the three older sisters to remain here , at least until they have completed their final school exams , " he said .
" if they complete their exams successfully , and can live independently in germany , then they can certainly stay here in the future .
for the parents and other family members , i did n't feel i could justify making an exception . " a group of hayriye 's teachers and friends ' parents guaranteed to pay the girls ' expenses and started a petition to allow the entire family to remain in germany . in 1989 , when the aydin family first arrived in germany , they were denied asylum seeker status and procured false documents to stay in the country for 17 years .
feyyaz aydin , hayriye 's father , said he resorted to lying to german officials because he feared being sent back to turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said he would examine the situation of illegal refugees in germany family " embodies concept of integration " the committee on petitions at the state parliament in berlin , is investigating whether or not the aydins could be allowed to stay in germany .
gerd fitkau , one of the members of the german parliament looking into the case , said he does n't feel anyone in the family should be deported . " the aydins really embody the concept of integration , " he said .
" there are 11 children , including hayriye , who despite being a muslim , campaigned in a berlin initiative against anti-semitism .
the children are all active in school , as class representatives , and pupil-teacher mediators . " german president horst köhler has promised to personally look into the aydin case , although he stressed that he could n't make any promises .
köhler also said he would investigate difficulties with the right of residence for families who have lived as illegal long-term refugees in germany . jane conway -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.03.2006 belarus opposition figure seized großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police beat protesters in the belarusian capital minsk a high-profile belarussian opposition figure was arrested following a rally in minsk saturday , a day after eu leaders slapped sanctions on president alexander lukashenko . " the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .
talking about minsk , lavrov also said he was " sure that protests like this have little chance of changing anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov sees nothing wrong in the crush of protests in belarus " these people spent several days on the square but we did n't understand what they were hoping for , " said lavrov , apparently confirming moscow 's approval of the status quo in belarus . the minister saw the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as responsible for inciting the belarus protests . " unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .
a foreign ministry spokeswoman said : " this election has shown that belarus is governed by an authoritarian regime that can not be passively observed .

now , a soccer park is to be built in front of parliament for fans to watch and play the beautiful game during the event . before german politicians returned to berlin from bonn and reclaimed the reichstag or parliament in 1999 , the grassy patch in front of one germany 's most historical landmarks was a meeting point where people could get out and enjoy a bit of green in the asphalt jungle of the city . one beloved activity was playing soccer - something that politicians decided was unworthy of republic square , the official name of the area in front of the parliament .
playing ball was prohibited . now that 's set to change during the upcoming world cup in germany .
the city of berlin last week provided relief for the thousands of fans who will be unable to get their hands on tickets for any of the matches , let alone for the six in berlin , including the final : sportswear giant adidas , which has been searching for a proper location in berlin for almost a year , has said it will build a " 13th world cup venue " on republic square . for the city which lost austrian artist andre heller 's glittering opening ceremony after a lawn dispute with fifa at the real berlin world cup venue , it can provide an interesting alternative to just watching matches in bars or at home to soccer supporters from around the world . " for those unable to get tickets for a world cup game , it offers the chance to soak up the atmosphere , " said berlin mayor klaus wowereit . mini-stadium to attract huge crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real olympic stadium will host the world cup final on july 9 the stadium is to be a replica of berlin 's olympic stadium on a scale of 1:3.3 .
up to 10,000 fans can sit in the arena which adidas said will cost tens of million of euros to build .
all 64 world cup games are to be broadcast on giant screens on the grounds at the reichstag .
adidas expects up to 70,000 visitors per day . yet the action will not be limited to passive spectating .
around the stadium , soccer fields will be set up .
tournaments are supposed to be held .

now , a soccer park is to be built in front of parliament for fans to watch and play the beautiful game during the event . before german politicians returned to berlin from bonn and reclaimed the reichstag or parliament in 1999 , the grassy patch in front of one germany 's most historical landmarks was a meeting point where people could get out and enjoy a bit of green in the asphalt jungle of the city . one beloved activity was playing soccer - something that politicians decided was unworthy of republic square , the official name of the area in front of the parliament .
playing ball was prohibited . now that 's set to change during the upcoming world cup in germany .
the city of berlin last week provided relief for the thousands of fans who will be unable to get their hands on tickets for any of the matches , let alone for the six in berlin , including the final : sportswear giant adidas , which has been searching for a proper location in berlin for almost a year , has said it will build a " 13th world cup venue " on republic square . for the city which lost austrian artist andre heller 's glittering opening ceremony after a lawn dispute with fifa at the real berlin world cup venue , it can provide an interesting alternative to just watching matches in bars or at home to soccer supporters from around the world . " for those unable to get tickets for a world cup game , it offers the chance to soak up the atmosphere , " said berlin mayor klaus wowereit . mini-stadium to attract huge crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real olympic stadium will host the world cup final on july 9 the stadium is to be a replica of berlin 's olympic stadium on a scale of 1:3.3 .
up to 10,000 fans can sit in the arena which adidas said will cost tens of million of euros to build .
all 64 world cup games are to be broadcast on giant screens on the grounds at the reichstag .
adidas expects up to 70,000 visitors per day . yet the action will not be limited to passive spectating .
around the stadium , soccer fields will be set up .
tournaments are supposed to be held .
schools are encouraged to take field trips to the park and play soccer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.03.2006 belarus opposition figure seized großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police beat protesters in the belarusian capital minsk a high-profile belarussian opposition figure was arrested following a rally in minsk saturday , a day after eu leaders slapped sanctions on president alexander lukashenko . " the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .
talking about minsk , lavrov also said he was " sure that protests like this have little chance of changing anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov sees nothing wrong in the crush of protests in belarus " these people spent several days on the square but we did n't understand what they were hoping for , " said lavrov , apparently confirming moscow 's approval of the status quo in belarus . the minister saw the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as responsible for inciting the belarus protests . " unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .
a foreign ministry spokeswoman said : " this election has shown that belarus is governed by an authoritarian regime that can not be passively observed .

even as german president köhler weighed into the debate of sending german troops to congo , deutsche welle 's africa correspondent ludger schadomsky argues that the germans might be biting off more than they can chew . clearly , a european presence in the democratic republic of congo makes sense . mission artemis proved this in the east of the country in 2003 .
within 24 hours the french foreign legionnaires managed to do what un-peacekeepers from uruguay had failed to accomplish in weeks : the legion disarmed militia groups in the ituri province and protected civilians from rebel attacks . concerns over malaria tablets and child soldiers but whether germany of all countries has the knowledge and experience to be the lead nation of eu-troops in drc is questionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians are worried that peacekeepers might be up against child soldiers the german army is currently more concerned about the side effects of malaria tablets and some conservative politicians only care about german resource interests in the drc .
the debate becomes even more ridiculous when german parliamentarians fret about whether german soldiers might have to shoot child soldiers . it ’ s more than likely though that no child soldier will be seen in the command-center in potsdam in eastern germany , nor in safe gabun , where most of the troops will be deployed . the question that is most pressing is whether there are enough german soldiers in potsdam who actually speak well enough french in order to discuss a possible evacuation in kinshasa with french troops . and what happens if riots break out , before the four-month mission ends ?
according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana , it ’ s up to the lead nation to decide about an extension of the mission - that ’ ll be up to germany then . one can only imagine the scene if all hell breaks loose : coordinators get stuck at kinshasa airport , even though they should be at the hindukush in afghanistan , defending german interests there . germany in a sticky position once again : a european rapid reaction force is all very well .
but 1500 soldiers who will be mainly deployed in a neighboring country simply are a farce and an embarrassment for the self-proclaimed super-power eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has bowed in to chirac 's desire to see germany take a leading role in congo german chancellor angela merkel who has little to no knowledge about africa has been tricked by the cunning fox jacques chirac into taking over the role as lead nation .
chirac who of course still plays colonial master in some parts of africa , now has germany to do the donkey work for him there . a withdrawal from the mission is hardly possible anymore . more harm than good ? let ’ s take a look back .
43 years ago was the last time a german soldier fought in the congo : the legendary mercenary soldier siegfried müller , also known as congo-müller , of course was a disgrace - he drove around with the scull of a rebel on his jeep . however , experts have long been discussing the option of using mercenaries .
because one thing is clear : an overstretched and inexperienced german lead nation can do more harm than good .
drc already has enough problems , it doesn ’ t need the so-called help of foreign troops who will barely be able to help themselves . maybe it wasn ’ t a coincidence that on his last visit to germany the drc ’ s foreign minister raymond baya said he didn ’ t know anything about a planned eu mission to congo . maybe he was just trying to give a broad hint . ludger schadomsky -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu states agree on congo peacekeeping mission the european union has agreed to send a small peacekeeping force to secure upcoming elections in the democratic republic of congo .

and that despite receiving nationwide recognition this week for her participation in an integration project . " it 's horrible , first you 're honored , then you 're deported , " she said .
" what are they thinking , tearing a family apart that 's lived here for 17 years , and can speak german ?
it 's incomprehensible that we ’ re being deported at all .

" i made an exception for the three older sisters to remain here , at least until they have completed their final school exams , " he said .
" if they complete their exams successfully , and can live independently in germany , then they can certainly stay here in the future .
for the parents and other family members , i did n't feel i could justify making an exception . " a group of hayriye 's teachers and friends ' parents guaranteed to pay the girls ' expenses and started a petition to allow the entire family to remain in germany . in 1989 , when the aydin family first arrived in germany , they were denied asylum seeker status and procured false documents to stay in the country for 17 years .
feyyaz aydin , hayriye 's father , said he resorted to lying to german officials because he feared being sent back to turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said he would examine the situation of illegal refugees in germany family " embodies concept of integration " the committee on petitions at the state parliament in berlin , is investigating whether or not the aydins could be allowed to stay in germany .
gerd fitkau , one of the members of the german parliament looking into the case , said he does n't feel anyone in the family should be deported . " the aydins really embody the concept of integration , " he said .
" there are 11 children , including hayriye , who despite being a muslim , campaigned in a berlin initiative against anti-semitism .
the children are all active in school , as class representatives , and pupil-teacher mediators . " german president horst köhler has promised to personally look into the aydin case , although he stressed that he could n't make any promises .

coach felix magath 's club had to fight hard on the road to get past relegation candidate duisburg , but in the end it turned into an easy 3-1 victory .
more importantly , their lead ballooned to nine points over hamburg . " we did too little in the first half but we showed in the second that we want to and can become bundesliga champions , " said magath after the game . indeed , heading into the second half , his side was down 1-0 after moroccan striker abdelaziz ahanfouf converted a penalty kick in the 40th minute .

lincoln put the home side ahead again in the second half .
christopher lamprecht ruined the celebratory mood of 60,000 schalke fans by scoring the equalizer 15 minutes from time . bremen put the past few weeks of bad play in the bundesliga behind them with a convincing 5-0 win over outclassed hanover .

now , a soccer park is to be built in front of parliament for fans to watch and play the beautiful game during the event . before german politicians returned to berlin from bonn and reclaimed the reichstag or parliament in 1999 , the grassy patch in front of one germany 's most historical landmarks was a meeting point where people could get out and enjoy a bit of green in the asphalt jungle of the city . one beloved activity was playing soccer - something that politicians decided was unworthy of republic square , the official name of the area in front of the parliament .
playing ball was prohibited . now that 's set to change during the upcoming world cup in germany .
the city of berlin last week provided relief for the thousands of fans who will be unable to get their hands on tickets for any of the matches , let alone for the six in berlin , including the final : sportswear giant adidas , which has been searching for a proper location in berlin for almost a year , has said it will build a " 13th world cup venue " on republic square . for the city which lost austrian artist andre heller 's glittering opening ceremony after a lawn dispute with fifa at the real berlin world cup venue , it can provide an interesting alternative to just watching matches in bars or at home to soccer supporters from around the world . " for those unable to get tickets for a world cup game , it offers the chance to soak up the atmosphere , " said berlin mayor klaus wowereit . mini-stadium to attract huge crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real olympic stadium will host the world cup final on july 9 the stadium is to be a replica of berlin 's olympic stadium on a scale of 1:3.3 .
up to 10,000 fans can sit in the arena which adidas said will cost tens of million of euros to build .
all 64 world cup games are to be broadcast on giant screens on the grounds at the reichstag .
adidas expects up to 70,000 visitors per day . yet the action will not be limited to passive spectating .
around the stadium , soccer fields will be set up .
tournaments are supposed to be held .
schools are encouraged to take field trips to the park and play soccer .
also , no world cup in germany would be complete without a beer garden .
the public in general should have a good time . even on those few days when soccer players and fans have the day off from the tournament , the mini-stadium will host concerts .
us hip-hop group " the black eyed peas " are scheduled for june 28 .
english singer-songwriter james blunt is scheduled to perform on july 7 . final match pitch to be sold to general public adidas also does not want to chase people away by charging high ticket prices .
the cost to get into the soccer park will be one euro and just three euros to get into the stadium , excluding concerts of course .
all proceeds will go to charity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hopes to generate an atmosphere similar to christo 's wrapped reichstag project when the world cup is over , the cherished grass in front of the reichstag will be replaced . finally , for those fanatics who feel that being at the finals is the only true way to feel the fervor but still ca n't get their hands on those elusive tickets , they can at least smell the grass . this year , for the first time ever , the general public can purchase a potential piece of soccer history - they can already reserve a section of the final match pitch .

coach felix magath 's club had to fight hard on the road to get past relegation candidate duisburg , but in the end it turned into an easy 3-1 victory .
more importantly , their lead ballooned to nine points over hamburg . " we did too little in the first half but we showed in the second that we want to and can become bundesliga champions , " said magath after the game . indeed , heading into the second half , his side was down 1-0 after moroccan striker abdelaziz ahanfouf converted a penalty kick in the 40th minute .
for the first 20 minutes in the second half , the duisburg fans could celebrate as the bavarians found it hard to crack the defense . when roy makaay delivered a cross from out of the schoolbook to hasan salihamidzic , the midfielder made no mistake that this would after all be bayern munich 's day and got the equalizer in the 66th minute .
six minutes later , the bosnian returned the favour to makaay .
the score was 2-1 before peruvian front man claudio pizarro scored the final goal . bildunterschrift : benjamin lauth -lrb- l -rrb- scored for hamburg but dortmund went home with three points hamburg , bayern 's closest challenger in the standings , stumbled at home against a hard-fighting dortmund and lost 4-2 .

with 23 minutes to go , it looked as if they would keep pace . brazilian striker ailton , acquired in the winter to add some needed firepower , scored his first goal with his new club .
it put hamburg up 2-1 but before the roar of the 56,000 home fans subsided , tomas rosicky scored a spectacular equalizer .
the turn of events had hamburg on their heels and the visitors felt it .
it took 15 minutes but florian kringe then scored the gamewinner .
rosicky scored an empty net goal in stoppage time for the final result . schalke hand third place back to bremen heading into saturday 's encounter , the timing of the visit of schalke 's opponent , relegation-threatened wolfsburg , could n't have been better , but the hosts had to make due with a 2-2 draw and hand third place back to bremen .
schalke had a promising start on a quick strike from german national striker kevin kuranyi after just seven minutes . bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi -lrb- ctr -rrb- returned after an injury to score once for schalke coach mirko slomka 's " royal blues " then let their engines idle .
that was a fatal mistake against the wolves who bit back in the 29th minute on a goal by dutchman rick hoogendorp .
lincoln put the home side ahead again in the second half .
christopher lamprecht ruined the celebratory mood of 60,000 schalke fans by scoring the equalizer 15 minutes from time . bremen put the past few weeks of bad play in the bundesliga behind them with a convincing 5-0 win over outclassed hanover .
it took over 40 minutes for the first goal to be scored by paraguayan nelson valdez , but then they came in droves for bremen .
valdez found the net two more times .
striker colleague miroslav klose and johan micoud also scored , and now bremen are one point ahead of schalke for third place . leverkusen shrug off manipulation accusations a new scandal is brewing in the bundesliga .

former national player paul freier improved his chances for a recall from national coach jürgen klinsmann by playing impressively in the match , including scoring once .
dimitar berbatov sealed the game with a header in the 89th minute .
with the win , leverkusen remain in the fight for a spot in the uefa cup next season . berlin hurt their chances to play in international competition with a 2-2 draw in mainz .
marko pantelic got both berlin goals , including one of the most impressive headers of the season to tie the game just before time .
michael thurk and american conor casey provided the offense for mainz . cologne manage only draw against frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne coach hanspeter latour needs to do more than gesticulate wildly last place cologne were in desperate need of three points against frankfurt to preserve what little chance they have of remaining in the first division , but they came away with only a 1-1 draw .
midfielder christian springer shocked frankfurt in the second minute to put cologne ahead early .
marco rehmer responded with the equalizer just 14 minutes later for the guests .
with 19 points in 27 matches , cologne can start preparing themselves for the second league . kaiserslautern 's resurgence continued with a 3-0 home win over borussia mönchengladbach which boosted their chances of avoiding relegation in one of two matches played sunday . two rapid-fire first half goals from halil altintop and the clincher from ervin skela with twenty minutes to go sent gladbach crashing to defeat with a whimper . the woeful visitors put up very little resistance as kaiserslautern clinched the points which kept them in 16th place , the final relegation slot in the 18-team first division .
however , they are now just a point behind wolfsburg and mainz in the two spots above them and have seven games to make further advances up the league . the defeat further knocks gladbach 's chances of european football next season and roots them to tenth place . in sunday 's other game , arminia bielefeld drew 0-0 with nuremberg in a clash between two mid-table sides . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga holds valuable lessons for us players even after the us team 's 4-1 loss against germany in a soccer friendly wednesday , many americans will continue gaining experience they would n't be able to get at home by chasing germans across the bundesliga 's fields .

even as german president köhler weighed into the debate of sending german troops to congo , deutsche welle 's africa correspondent ludger schadomsky argues that the germans might be biting off more than they can chew . clearly , a european presence in the democratic republic of congo makes sense . mission artemis proved this in the east of the country in 2003 .
within 24 hours the french foreign legionnaires managed to do what un-peacekeepers from uruguay had failed to accomplish in weeks : the legion disarmed militia groups in the ituri province and protected civilians from rebel attacks . concerns over malaria tablets and child soldiers but whether germany of all countries has the knowledge and experience to be the lead nation of eu-troops in drc is questionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians are worried that peacekeepers might be up against child soldiers the german army is currently more concerned about the side effects of malaria tablets and some conservative politicians only care about german resource interests in the drc .
the debate becomes even more ridiculous when german parliamentarians fret about whether german soldiers might have to shoot child soldiers . it ’ s more than likely though that no child soldier will be seen in the command-center in potsdam in eastern germany , nor in safe gabun , where most of the troops will be deployed . the question that is most pressing is whether there are enough german soldiers in potsdam who actually speak well enough french in order to discuss a possible evacuation in kinshasa with french troops . and what happens if riots break out , before the four-month mission ends ?
according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana , it ’ s up to the lead nation to decide about an extension of the mission - that ’ ll be up to germany then . one can only imagine the scene if all hell breaks loose : coordinators get stuck at kinshasa airport , even though they should be at the hindukush in afghanistan , defending german interests there . germany in a sticky position once again : a european rapid reaction force is all very well .
but 1500 soldiers who will be mainly deployed in a neighboring country simply are a farce and an embarrassment for the self-proclaimed super-power eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has bowed in to chirac 's desire to see germany take a leading role in congo german chancellor angela merkel who has little to no knowledge about africa has been tricked by the cunning fox jacques chirac into taking over the role as lead nation .
chirac who of course still plays colonial master in some parts of africa , now has germany to do the donkey work for him there . a withdrawal from the mission is hardly possible anymore . more harm than good ? let ’ s take a look back .
43 years ago was the last time a german soldier fought in the congo : the legendary mercenary soldier siegfried müller , also known as congo-müller , of course was a disgrace - he drove around with the scull of a rebel on his jeep . however , experts have long been discussing the option of using mercenaries .
because one thing is clear : an overstretched and inexperienced german lead nation can do more harm than good .
drc already has enough problems , it doesn ’ t need the so-called help of foreign troops who will barely be able to help themselves . maybe it wasn ’ t a coincidence that on his last visit to germany the drc ’ s foreign minister raymond baya said he didn ’ t know anything about a planned eu mission to congo . maybe he was just trying to give a broad hint . ludger schadomsky -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu states agree on congo peacekeeping mission the european union has agreed to send a small peacekeeping force to secure upcoming elections in the democratic republic of congo .
germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain .
-lrb- march 23 , 2006 -rrb- german parliamentarians voice opposition to congo mission germany 's foreign minister has declared that german troops are ready to lead an eu mission in the democratic republic of congo , but if critics from within the government have their way , that wo n't be the last word .
-lrb- march 22 , 2006 -rrb- merkel prepared to send troops to congo , reports say according to german newspaper reports , chancellor angela merkel is willing to send troops to the democratic republic of congo to help with planned elections in the war-ravaged country .

with 19 points in 27 matches , cologne can start preparing themselves for the second league . kaiserslautern 's resurgence continued with a 3-0 home win over borussia mönchengladbach which boosted their chances of avoiding relegation in one of two matches played sunday . two rapid-fire first half goals from halil altintop and the clincher from ervin skela with twenty minutes to go sent gladbach crashing to defeat with a whimper . the woeful visitors put up very little resistance as kaiserslautern clinched the points which kept them in 16th place , the final relegation slot in the 18-team first division .
however , they are now just a point behind wolfsburg and mainz in the two spots above them and have seven games to make further advances up the league . the defeat further knocks gladbach 's chances of european football next season and roots them to tenth place . in sunday 's other game , arminia bielefeld drew 0-0 with nuremberg in a clash between two mid-table sides . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga holds valuable lessons for us players even after the us team 's 4-1 loss against germany in a soccer friendly wednesday , many americans will continue gaining experience they would n't be able to get at home by chasing germans across the bundesliga 's fields .

" the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .

" unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .

now , a soccer park is to be built in front of parliament for fans to watch and play the beautiful game during the event . before german politicians returned to berlin from bonn and reclaimed the reichstag or parliament in 1999 , the grassy patch in front of one germany 's most historical landmarks was a meeting point where people could get out and enjoy a bit of green in the asphalt jungle of the city . one beloved activity was playing soccer - something that politicians decided was unworthy of republic square , the official name of the area in front of the parliament .
playing ball was prohibited . now that 's set to change during the upcoming world cup in germany .
the city of berlin last week provided relief for the thousands of fans who will be unable to get their hands on tickets for any of the matches , let alone for the six in berlin , including the final : sportswear giant adidas , which has been searching for a proper location in berlin for almost a year , has said it will build a " 13th world cup venue " on republic square . for the city which lost austrian artist andre heller 's glittering opening ceremony after a lawn dispute with fifa at the real berlin world cup venue , it can provide an interesting alternative to just watching matches in bars or at home to soccer supporters from around the world . " for those unable to get tickets for a world cup game , it offers the chance to soak up the atmosphere , " said berlin mayor klaus wowereit . mini-stadium to attract huge crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real olympic stadium will host the world cup final on july 9 the stadium is to be a replica of berlin 's olympic stadium on a scale of 1:3.3 .

all 64 world cup games are to be broadcast on giant screens on the grounds at the reichstag .
adidas expects up to 70,000 visitors per day . yet the action will not be limited to passive spectating .

us hip-hop group " the black eyed peas " are scheduled for june 28 .
english singer-songwriter james blunt is scheduled to perform on july 7 . final match pitch to be sold to general public adidas also does not want to chase people away by charging high ticket prices .
the cost to get into the soccer park will be one euro and just three euros to get into the stadium , excluding concerts of course .
all proceeds will go to charity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hopes to generate an atmosphere similar to christo 's wrapped reichstag project when the world cup is over , the cherished grass in front of the reichstag will be replaced . finally , for those fanatics who feel that being at the finals is the only true way to feel the fervor but still ca n't get their hands on those elusive tickets , they can at least smell the grass . this year , for the first time ever , the general public can purchase a potential piece of soccer history - they can already reserve a section of the final match pitch .

even as german president köhler weighed into the debate of sending german troops to congo , deutsche welle 's africa correspondent ludger schadomsky argues that the germans might be biting off more than they can chew . clearly , a european presence in the democratic republic of congo makes sense . mission artemis proved this in the east of the country in 2003 .
within 24 hours the french foreign legionnaires managed to do what un-peacekeepers from uruguay had failed to accomplish in weeks : the legion disarmed militia groups in the ituri province and protected civilians from rebel attacks . concerns over malaria tablets and child soldiers but whether germany of all countries has the knowledge and experience to be the lead nation of eu-troops in drc is questionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians are worried that peacekeepers might be up against child soldiers the german army is currently more concerned about the side effects of malaria tablets and some conservative politicians only care about german resource interests in the drc .
the debate becomes even more ridiculous when german parliamentarians fret about whether german soldiers might have to shoot child soldiers . it ’ s more than likely though that no child soldier will be seen in the command-center in potsdam in eastern germany , nor in safe gabun , where most of the troops will be deployed . the question that is most pressing is whether there are enough german soldiers in potsdam who actually speak well enough french in order to discuss a possible evacuation in kinshasa with french troops . and what happens if riots break out , before the four-month mission ends ?
according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana , it ’ s up to the lead nation to decide about an extension of the mission - that ’ ll be up to germany then . one can only imagine the scene if all hell breaks loose : coordinators get stuck at kinshasa airport , even though they should be at the hindukush in afghanistan , defending german interests there . germany in a sticky position once again : a european rapid reaction force is all very well .
but 1500 soldiers who will be mainly deployed in a neighboring country simply are a farce and an embarrassment for the self-proclaimed super-power eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has bowed in to chirac 's desire to see germany take a leading role in congo german chancellor angela merkel who has little to no knowledge about africa has been tricked by the cunning fox jacques chirac into taking over the role as lead nation .
chirac who of course still plays colonial master in some parts of africa , now has germany to do the donkey work for him there . a withdrawal from the mission is hardly possible anymore . more harm than good ? let ’ s take a look back .
43 years ago was the last time a german soldier fought in the congo : the legendary mercenary soldier siegfried müller , also known as congo-müller , of course was a disgrace - he drove around with the scull of a rebel on his jeep . however , experts have long been discussing the option of using mercenaries .
because one thing is clear : an overstretched and inexperienced german lead nation can do more harm than good .
drc already has enough problems , it doesn ’ t need the so-called help of foreign troops who will barely be able to help themselves . maybe it wasn ’ t a coincidence that on his last visit to germany the drc ’ s foreign minister raymond baya said he didn ’ t know anything about a planned eu mission to congo . maybe he was just trying to give a broad hint . ludger schadomsky -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu states agree on congo peacekeeping mission the european union has agreed to send a small peacekeeping force to secure upcoming elections in the democratic republic of congo .
germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.03.2006 belarus opposition figure seized großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police beat protesters in the belarusian capital minsk a high-profile belarussian opposition figure was arrested following a rally in minsk saturday , a day after eu leaders slapped sanctions on president alexander lukashenko . " the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .
talking about minsk , lavrov also said he was " sure that protests like this have little chance of changing anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov sees nothing wrong in the crush of protests in belarus " these people spent several days on the square but we did n't understand what they were hoping for , " said lavrov , apparently confirming moscow 's approval of the status quo in belarus . the minister saw the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as responsible for inciting the belarus protests . " unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .
a foreign ministry spokeswoman said : " this election has shown that belarus is governed by an authoritarian regime that can not be passively observed .

now , a soccer park is to be built in front of parliament for fans to watch and play the beautiful game during the event . before german politicians returned to berlin from bonn and reclaimed the reichstag or parliament in 1999 , the grassy patch in front of one germany 's most historical landmarks was a meeting point where people could get out and enjoy a bit of green in the asphalt jungle of the city . one beloved activity was playing soccer - something that politicians decided was unworthy of republic square , the official name of the area in front of the parliament .
playing ball was prohibited . now that 's set to change during the upcoming world cup in germany .
the city of berlin last week provided relief for the thousands of fans who will be unable to get their hands on tickets for any of the matches , let alone for the six in berlin , including the final : sportswear giant adidas , which has been searching for a proper location in berlin for almost a year , has said it will build a " 13th world cup venue " on republic square . for the city which lost austrian artist andre heller 's glittering opening ceremony after a lawn dispute with fifa at the real berlin world cup venue , it can provide an interesting alternative to just watching matches in bars or at home to soccer supporters from around the world . " for those unable to get tickets for a world cup game , it offers the chance to soak up the atmosphere , " said berlin mayor klaus wowereit . mini-stadium to attract huge crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real olympic stadium will host the world cup final on july 9 the stadium is to be a replica of berlin 's olympic stadium on a scale of 1:3.3 .
up to 10,000 fans can sit in the arena which adidas said will cost tens of million of euros to build .
all 64 world cup games are to be broadcast on giant screens on the grounds at the reichstag .
adidas expects up to 70,000 visitors per day . yet the action will not be limited to passive spectating .
around the stadium , soccer fields will be set up .
tournaments are supposed to be held .
schools are encouraged to take field trips to the park and play soccer .
also , no world cup in germany would be complete without a beer garden .
the public in general should have a good time . even on those few days when soccer players and fans have the day off from the tournament , the mini-stadium will host concerts .
us hip-hop group " the black eyed peas " are scheduled for june 28 .
english singer-songwriter james blunt is scheduled to perform on july 7 . final match pitch to be sold to general public adidas also does not want to chase people away by charging high ticket prices .
the cost to get into the soccer park will be one euro and just three euros to get into the stadium , excluding concerts of course .
all proceeds will go to charity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hopes to generate an atmosphere similar to christo 's wrapped reichstag project when the world cup is over , the cherished grass in front of the reichstag will be replaced . finally , for those fanatics who feel that being at the finals is the only true way to feel the fervor but still ca n't get their hands on those elusive tickets , they can at least smell the grass . this year , for the first time ever , the general public can purchase a potential piece of soccer history - they can already reserve a section of the final match pitch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.03.2006 opinion : is germany fit to lead peacekeepers in congo ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would an eu mission in congo do more harm than good ?
even as german president köhler weighed into the debate of sending german troops to congo , deutsche welle 's africa correspondent ludger schadomsky argues that the germans might be biting off more than they can chew . clearly , a european presence in the democratic republic of congo makes sense . mission artemis proved this in the east of the country in 2003 .
within 24 hours the french foreign legionnaires managed to do what un-peacekeepers from uruguay had failed to accomplish in weeks : the legion disarmed militia groups in the ituri province and protected civilians from rebel attacks . concerns over malaria tablets and child soldiers but whether germany of all countries has the knowledge and experience to be the lead nation of eu-troops in drc is questionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians are worried that peacekeepers might be up against child soldiers the german army is currently more concerned about the side effects of malaria tablets and some conservative politicians only care about german resource interests in the drc .
the debate becomes even more ridiculous when german parliamentarians fret about whether german soldiers might have to shoot child soldiers . it ’ s more than likely though that no child soldier will be seen in the command-center in potsdam in eastern germany , nor in safe gabun , where most of the troops will be deployed . the question that is most pressing is whether there are enough german soldiers in potsdam who actually speak well enough french in order to discuss a possible evacuation in kinshasa with french troops . and what happens if riots break out , before the four-month mission ends ?
according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana , it ’ s up to the lead nation to decide about an extension of the mission - that ’ ll be up to germany then . one can only imagine the scene if all hell breaks loose : coordinators get stuck at kinshasa airport , even though they should be at the hindukush in afghanistan , defending german interests there . germany in a sticky position once again : a european rapid reaction force is all very well .
but 1500 soldiers who will be mainly deployed in a neighboring country simply are a farce and an embarrassment for the self-proclaimed super-power eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has bowed in to chirac 's desire to see germany take a leading role in congo german chancellor angela merkel who has little to no knowledge about africa has been tricked by the cunning fox jacques chirac into taking over the role as lead nation .
chirac who of course still plays colonial master in some parts of africa , now has germany to do the donkey work for him there . a withdrawal from the mission is hardly possible anymore . more harm than good ? let ’ s take a look back .
43 years ago was the last time a german soldier fought in the congo : the legendary mercenary soldier siegfried müller , also known as congo-müller , of course was a disgrace - he drove around with the scull of a rebel on his jeep . however , experts have long been discussing the option of using mercenaries .
because one thing is clear : an overstretched and inexperienced german lead nation can do more harm than good .
drc already has enough problems , it doesn ’ t need the so-called help of foreign troops who will barely be able to help themselves . maybe it wasn ’ t a coincidence that on his last visit to germany the drc ’ s foreign minister raymond baya said he didn ’ t know anything about a planned eu mission to congo . maybe he was just trying to give a broad hint . ludger schadomsky -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu states agree on congo peacekeeping mission the european union has agreed to send a small peacekeeping force to secure upcoming elections in the democratic republic of congo .

" the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .
talking about minsk , lavrov also said he was " sure that protests like this have little chance of changing anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov sees nothing wrong in the crush of protests in belarus " these people spent several days on the square but we did n't understand what they were hoping for , " said lavrov , apparently confirming moscow 's approval of the status quo in belarus . the minister saw the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as responsible for inciting the belarus protests . " unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .
a foreign ministry spokeswoman said : " this election has shown that belarus is governed by an authoritarian regime that can not be passively observed .

" we must tell them firmly no ! " he yelled at an adoring , 20,000-strong crowd bathed in a sea of the blue and white ribbons of his campaign . yanukovych 's " them " are the " oranges " - ukraine 's former opposition leaders who led mass protests when results from the presidential election in late 2004 initially gave him victory .
the supreme court eventually threw the ballot out because of massive fraud and ordered a new round of voting , won by the incumbent president viktor yushchenko . to this crowd , the " oranges " are nationalists who managed to stage a coup d 'etat and plan to forcefully " ukrainize " this traditionally russian-speaking region .
they are n't particularly liked in odessa . meanwhile 600 kilometers -lrb- 375 miles -rrb- northwest , in the towns around the western city of lviv , yulia tymoshenko was battling two " thems " at once . former pm looking to eclipse " corrupt " rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yulia tymoshenko will shed the orange this weekend tymoshenko was one of the main leaders of the " orange revolution " but split with yushchenko after he fired her as premier last september .
her " them " are yanukovych 's " forces of revanche " and yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc , whom she is battling for the " orange " electorate and whose leadership she has labeled corrupt . following her sacking , tymoshenko ditched orange paraphernalia for a red heart on a white background and ribbons and flags with the insignia flutter from trees and bushes for several kilometers along the town 's main thoroughfare . tymoshenko 's supporters believe yanukovych is part of a corrupt group of " bandits " that ruled ukraine for a decade under the previous regime and tried to hang on to power through fraud , agents of russia that 's once again trying to subjugate and " russify " ukraine . tymoshenko vows she would never join forces with such people and warns that her former " orange " comrades are considering such a union , that they 're not capable of " standing up to evil . " ukraine is europe-bound regardless of winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuriy yekhanurov says ukraine is on course for europe whoever wins the election on sunday , ukraine ’ s westwards drift towards the rest of europe will continue , according to the prime minister yuriy yekhanurov . however , in an interview with the russian daily izvestia he said that if the pro-russian opposition wins , it would slow down the process by " three or four years " , and that kiev would continue to cooperate with moscow . " if -lrb- president viktor -rrb- yushchenko 's side wins ukraine will enter europe quicker .
if the other side does , the process will be slowed down by three or four years .
but the direction will not change , " yekhanurov said . yekhanurov also said ukraine could continue to cooperate closely with russia who ever wins , especially in the energy sector .
" we are interested in building an extra pipeline -lrb- between the russia-kazakhstan and ukrainian-slovakian border -rrb- , " he said . yushchenko wants victory to pursue reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko and yanukovych : bitter rivals again " as regards the eu ... ukraine should first integrate with europe 's energy system , increase the sales of its electric energy to the west , " he said . yushchenko needs his forces to gain a stable majority in parliament in order to continue reforms aimed at driving ukraine toward western clubs like the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- . although he enjoyed the backing of 70 percent of his countrymen when he assumed power in january 2005 , the slowing economy and infighting within his forces has eroded their support . economy a hot topic in sunday 's poll the state of ukraine 's economy is a hotly debated issue , with one side saying it 's in dire straits , the other that it 's never been better . yanukovych paints a bleak economic picture , blaming his rival yushchenko for the downturn which followed his election .
" economic policies of these authorities can only be called financial recklessness and economic irresponsibility , " he said recently in kiev .
yushchenko unsurprisingly , says the economy is in good shape . however , his promise of turning ukraine into a new investment paradise has not borne fruit , mostly because investors became wary of the government of his former " orange revolution " partner tymoshenko and her vows to review past questionable privatizations , and because investors were waiting to see the nation 's political landscape after this weekend 's parliamentary poll . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine boxing hero eyes political title in kiev vitali klitschko , the former wbc heavyweight champion and one of ukraine 's most popular public figures , is running for the post of mayor of kiev in march elections .

and that despite receiving nationwide recognition this week for her participation in an integration project . " it 's horrible , first you 're honored , then you 're deported , " she said .
" what are they thinking , tearing a family apart that 's lived here for 17 years , and can speak german ?
it 's incomprehensible that we ’ re being deported at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a repressed minority in turkey , a number of kurds have fled to europe exception made for three family members for the time being , an exception made by berlin 's interior senator ehrhart körting will allow hayriye and two of her sisters to remain in germany , while her parents and four younger siblings are deported . " i made an exception for the three older sisters to remain here , at least until they have completed their final school exams , " he said .
" if they complete their exams successfully , and can live independently in germany , then they can certainly stay here in the future .
for the parents and other family members , i did n't feel i could justify making an exception . " a group of hayriye 's teachers and friends ' parents guaranteed to pay the girls ' expenses and started a petition to allow the entire family to remain in germany . in 1989 , when the aydin family first arrived in germany , they were denied asylum seeker status and procured false documents to stay in the country for 17 years .
feyyaz aydin , hayriye 's father , said he resorted to lying to german officials because he feared being sent back to turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said he would examine the situation of illegal refugees in germany family " embodies concept of integration " the committee on petitions at the state parliament in berlin , is investigating whether or not the aydins could be allowed to stay in germany .
gerd fitkau , one of the members of the german parliament looking into the case , said he does n't feel anyone in the family should be deported . " the aydins really embody the concept of integration , " he said .
" there are 11 children , including hayriye , who despite being a muslim , campaigned in a berlin initiative against anti-semitism .
the children are all active in school , as class representatives , and pupil-teacher mediators . " german president horst köhler has promised to personally look into the aydin case , although he stressed that he could n't make any promises .
köhler also said he would investigate difficulties with the right of residence for families who have lived as illegal long-term refugees in germany . jane conway -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .

" the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .

" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested .

even as german president köhler weighed into the debate of sending german troops to congo , deutsche welle 's africa correspondent ludger schadomsky argues that the germans might be biting off more than they can chew . clearly , a european presence in the democratic republic of congo makes sense . mission artemis proved this in the east of the country in 2003 .
within 24 hours the french foreign legionnaires managed to do what un-peacekeepers from uruguay had failed to accomplish in weeks : the legion disarmed militia groups in the ituri province and protected civilians from rebel attacks . concerns over malaria tablets and child soldiers but whether germany of all countries has the knowledge and experience to be the lead nation of eu-troops in drc is questionable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some german politicians are worried that peacekeepers might be up against child soldiers the german army is currently more concerned about the side effects of malaria tablets and some conservative politicians only care about german resource interests in the drc .
the debate becomes even more ridiculous when german parliamentarians fret about whether german soldiers might have to shoot child soldiers . it ’ s more than likely though that no child soldier will be seen in the command-center in potsdam in eastern germany , nor in safe gabun , where most of the troops will be deployed . the question that is most pressing is whether there are enough german soldiers in potsdam who actually speak well enough french in order to discuss a possible evacuation in kinshasa with french troops . and what happens if riots break out , before the four-month mission ends ?
according to eu foreign policy chief javier solana , it ’ s up to the lead nation to decide about an extension of the mission - that ’ ll be up to germany then . one can only imagine the scene if all hell breaks loose : coordinators get stuck at kinshasa airport , even though they should be at the hindukush in afghanistan , defending german interests there . germany in a sticky position once again : a european rapid reaction force is all very well .
but 1500 soldiers who will be mainly deployed in a neighboring country simply are a farce and an embarrassment for the self-proclaimed super-power eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has bowed in to chirac 's desire to see germany take a leading role in congo german chancellor angela merkel who has little to no knowledge about africa has been tricked by the cunning fox jacques chirac into taking over the role as lead nation .
chirac who of course still plays colonial master in some parts of africa , now has germany to do the donkey work for him there . a withdrawal from the mission is hardly possible anymore . more harm than good ? let ’ s take a look back .
43 years ago was the last time a german soldier fought in the congo : the legendary mercenary soldier siegfried müller , also known as congo-müller , of course was a disgrace - he drove around with the scull of a rebel on his jeep . however , experts have long been discussing the option of using mercenaries .
because one thing is clear : an overstretched and inexperienced german lead nation can do more harm than good .
drc already has enough problems , it doesn ’ t need the so-called help of foreign troops who will barely be able to help themselves . maybe it wasn ’ t a coincidence that on his last visit to germany the drc ’ s foreign minister raymond baya said he didn ’ t know anything about a planned eu mission to congo . maybe he was just trying to give a broad hint . ludger schadomsky -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu states agree on congo peacekeeping mission the european union has agreed to send a small peacekeeping force to secure upcoming elections in the democratic republic of congo .
germany 's leadership of the mission , however , is still uncertain .
-lrb- march 23 , 2006 -rrb- german parliamentarians voice opposition to congo mission germany 's foreign minister has declared that german troops are ready to lead an eu mission in the democratic republic of congo , but if critics from within the government have their way , that wo n't be the last word .

christopher lamprecht ruined the celebratory mood of 60,000 schalke fans by scoring the equalizer 15 minutes from time . bremen put the past few weeks of bad play in the bundesliga behind them with a convincing 5-0 win over outclassed hanover .

coach felix magath 's club had to fight hard on the road to get past relegation candidate duisburg , but in the end it turned into an easy 3-1 victory .
more importantly , their lead ballooned to nine points over hamburg . " we did too little in the first half but we showed in the second that we want to and can become bundesliga champions , " said magath after the game . indeed , heading into the second half , his side was down 1-0 after moroccan striker abdelaziz ahanfouf converted a penalty kick in the 40th minute .
for the first 20 minutes in the second half , the duisburg fans could celebrate as the bavarians found it hard to crack the defense . when roy makaay delivered a cross from out of the schoolbook to hasan salihamidzic , the midfielder made no mistake that this would after all be bayern munich 's day and got the equalizer in the 66th minute .
six minutes later , the bosnian returned the favour to makaay .
the score was 2-1 before peruvian front man claudio pizarro scored the final goal . bildunterschrift : benjamin lauth -lrb- l -rrb- scored for hamburg but dortmund went home with three points hamburg , bayern 's closest challenger in the standings , stumbled at home against a hard-fighting dortmund and lost 4-2 .
manager thomas doll 's side now lie nine points behind leaders bayern .
with 23 minutes to go , it looked as if they would keep pace . brazilian striker ailton , acquired in the winter to add some needed firepower , scored his first goal with his new club .
it put hamburg up 2-1 but before the roar of the 56,000 home fans subsided , tomas rosicky scored a spectacular equalizer .
the turn of events had hamburg on their heels and the visitors felt it .
it took 15 minutes but florian kringe then scored the gamewinner .
rosicky scored an empty net goal in stoppage time for the final result . schalke hand third place back to bremen heading into saturday 's encounter , the timing of the visit of schalke 's opponent , relegation-threatened wolfsburg , could n't have been better , but the hosts had to make due with a 2-2 draw and hand third place back to bremen .
schalke had a promising start on a quick strike from german national striker kevin kuranyi after just seven minutes . bildunterschrift : kevin kuranyi -lrb- ctr -rrb- returned after an injury to score once for schalke coach mirko slomka 's " royal blues " then let their engines idle .
that was a fatal mistake against the wolves who bit back in the 29th minute on a goal by dutchman rick hoogendorp .
lincoln put the home side ahead again in the second half .
christopher lamprecht ruined the celebratory mood of 60,000 schalke fans by scoring the equalizer 15 minutes from time . bremen put the past few weeks of bad play in the bundesliga behind them with a convincing 5-0 win over outclassed hanover .
it took over 40 minutes for the first goal to be scored by paraguayan nelson valdez , but then they came in droves for bremen .
valdez found the net two more times .
striker colleague miroslav klose and johan micoud also scored , and now bremen are one point ahead of schalke for third place . leverkusen shrug off manipulation accusations a new scandal is brewing in the bundesliga .

former national player paul freier improved his chances for a recall from national coach jürgen klinsmann by playing impressively in the match , including scoring once .
dimitar berbatov sealed the game with a header in the 89th minute .
with the win , leverkusen remain in the fight for a spot in the uefa cup next season . berlin hurt their chances to play in international competition with a 2-2 draw in mainz .
marko pantelic got both berlin goals , including one of the most impressive headers of the season to tie the game just before time .
michael thurk and american conor casey provided the offense for mainz . cologne manage only draw against frankfurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne coach hanspeter latour needs to do more than gesticulate wildly last place cologne were in desperate need of three points against frankfurt to preserve what little chance they have of remaining in the first division , but they came away with only a 1-1 draw .
midfielder christian springer shocked frankfurt in the second minute to put cologne ahead early .
marco rehmer responded with the equalizer just 14 minutes later for the guests .
with 19 points in 27 matches , cologne can start preparing themselves for the second league . kaiserslautern 's resurgence continued with a 3-0 home win over borussia mönchengladbach which boosted their chances of avoiding relegation in one of two matches played sunday . two rapid-fire first half goals from halil altintop and the clincher from ervin skela with twenty minutes to go sent gladbach crashing to defeat with a whimper . the woeful visitors put up very little resistance as kaiserslautern clinched the points which kept them in 16th place , the final relegation slot in the 18-team first division .
however , they are now just a point behind wolfsburg and mainz in the two spots above them and have seven games to make further advances up the league . the defeat further knocks gladbach 's chances of european football next season and roots them to tenth place . in sunday 's other game , arminia bielefeld drew 0-0 with nuremberg in a clash between two mid-table sides . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga holds valuable lessons for us players even after the us team 's 4-1 loss against germany in a soccer friendly wednesday , many americans will continue gaining experience they would n't be able to get at home by chasing germans across the bundesliga 's fields .

" we must tell them firmly no ! " he yelled at an adoring , 20,000-strong crowd bathed in a sea of the blue and white ribbons of his campaign . yanukovych 's " them " are the " oranges " - ukraine 's former opposition leaders who led mass protests when results from the presidential election in late 2004 initially gave him victory .
the supreme court eventually threw the ballot out because of massive fraud and ordered a new round of voting , won by the incumbent president viktor yushchenko . to this crowd , the " oranges " are nationalists who managed to stage a coup d 'etat and plan to forcefully " ukrainize " this traditionally russian-speaking region .
they are n't particularly liked in odessa . meanwhile 600 kilometers -lrb- 375 miles -rrb- northwest , in the towns around the western city of lviv , yulia tymoshenko was battling two " thems " at once . former pm looking to eclipse " corrupt " rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yulia tymoshenko will shed the orange this weekend tymoshenko was one of the main leaders of the " orange revolution " but split with yushchenko after he fired her as premier last september .
her " them " are yanukovych 's " forces of revanche " and yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc , whom she is battling for the " orange " electorate and whose leadership she has labeled corrupt . following her sacking , tymoshenko ditched orange paraphernalia for a red heart on a white background and ribbons and flags with the insignia flutter from trees and bushes for several kilometers along the town 's main thoroughfare . tymoshenko 's supporters believe yanukovych is part of a corrupt group of " bandits " that ruled ukraine for a decade under the previous regime and tried to hang on to power through fraud , agents of russia that 's once again trying to subjugate and " russify " ukraine . tymoshenko vows she would never join forces with such people and warns that her former " orange " comrades are considering such a union , that they 're not capable of " standing up to evil . " ukraine is europe-bound regardless of winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuriy yekhanurov says ukraine is on course for europe whoever wins the election on sunday , ukraine ’ s westwards drift towards the rest of europe will continue , according to the prime minister yuriy yekhanurov . however , in an interview with the russian daily izvestia he said that if the pro-russian opposition wins , it would slow down the process by " three or four years " , and that kiev would continue to cooperate with moscow . " if -lrb- president viktor -rrb- yushchenko 's side wins ukraine will enter europe quicker .
if the other side does , the process will be slowed down by three or four years .
but the direction will not change , " yekhanurov said . yekhanurov also said ukraine could continue to cooperate closely with russia who ever wins , especially in the energy sector .
" we are interested in building an extra pipeline -lrb- between the russia-kazakhstan and ukrainian-slovakian border -rrb- , " he said . yushchenko wants victory to pursue reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko and yanukovych : bitter rivals again " as regards the eu ... ukraine should first integrate with europe 's energy system , increase the sales of its electric energy to the west , " he said . yushchenko needs his forces to gain a stable majority in parliament in order to continue reforms aimed at driving ukraine toward western clubs like the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- . although he enjoyed the backing of 70 percent of his countrymen when he assumed power in january 2005 , the slowing economy and infighting within his forces has eroded their support . economy a hot topic in sunday 's poll the state of ukraine 's economy is a hotly debated issue , with one side saying it 's in dire straits , the other that it 's never been better . yanukovych paints a bleak economic picture , blaming his rival yushchenko for the downturn which followed his election .
" economic policies of these authorities can only be called financial recklessness and economic irresponsibility , " he said recently in kiev .
yushchenko unsurprisingly , says the economy is in good shape . however , his promise of turning ukraine into a new investment paradise has not borne fruit , mostly because investors became wary of the government of his former " orange revolution " partner tymoshenko and her vows to review past questionable privatizations , and because investors were waiting to see the nation 's political landscape after this weekend 's parliamentary poll . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine boxing hero eyes political title in kiev vitali klitschko , the former wbc heavyweight champion and one of ukraine 's most popular public figures , is running for the post of mayor of kiev in march elections .

" we must tell them firmly no ! " he yelled at an adoring , 20,000-strong crowd bathed in a sea of the blue and white ribbons of his campaign . yanukovych 's " them " are the " oranges " - ukraine 's former opposition leaders who led mass protests when results from the presidential election in late 2004 initially gave him victory .
the supreme court eventually threw the ballot out because of massive fraud and ordered a new round of voting , won by the incumbent president viktor yushchenko . to this crowd , the " oranges " are nationalists who managed to stage a coup d 'etat and plan to forcefully " ukrainize " this traditionally russian-speaking region .
they are n't particularly liked in odessa . meanwhile 600 kilometers -lrb- 375 miles -rrb- northwest , in the towns around the western city of lviv , yulia tymoshenko was battling two " thems " at once . former pm looking to eclipse " corrupt " rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yulia tymoshenko will shed the orange this weekend tymoshenko was one of the main leaders of the " orange revolution " but split with yushchenko after he fired her as premier last september .
her " them " are yanukovych 's " forces of revanche " and yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc , whom she is battling for the " orange " electorate and whose leadership she has labeled corrupt . following her sacking , tymoshenko ditched orange paraphernalia for a red heart on a white background and ribbons and flags with the insignia flutter from trees and bushes for several kilometers along the town 's main thoroughfare . tymoshenko 's supporters believe yanukovych is part of a corrupt group of " bandits " that ruled ukraine for a decade under the previous regime and tried to hang on to power through fraud , agents of russia that 's once again trying to subjugate and " russify " ukraine . tymoshenko vows she would never join forces with such people and warns that her former " orange " comrades are considering such a union , that they 're not capable of " standing up to evil . " ukraine is europe-bound regardless of winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuriy yekhanurov says ukraine is on course for europe whoever wins the election on sunday , ukraine ’ s westwards drift towards the rest of europe will continue , according to the prime minister yuriy yekhanurov . however , in an interview with the russian daily izvestia he said that if the pro-russian opposition wins , it would slow down the process by " three or four years " , and that kiev would continue to cooperate with moscow . " if -lrb- president viktor -rrb- yushchenko 's side wins ukraine will enter europe quicker .
if the other side does , the process will be slowed down by three or four years .
but the direction will not change , " yekhanurov said . yekhanurov also said ukraine could continue to cooperate closely with russia who ever wins , especially in the energy sector .
" we are interested in building an extra pipeline -lrb- between the russia-kazakhstan and ukrainian-slovakian border -rrb- , " he said . yushchenko wants victory to pursue reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko and yanukovych : bitter rivals again " as regards the eu ... ukraine should first integrate with europe 's energy system , increase the sales of its electric energy to the west , " he said . yushchenko needs his forces to gain a stable majority in parliament in order to continue reforms aimed at driving ukraine toward western clubs like the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- . although he enjoyed the backing of 70 percent of his countrymen when he assumed power in january 2005 , the slowing economy and infighting within his forces has eroded their support . economy a hot topic in sunday 's poll the state of ukraine 's economy is a hotly debated issue , with one side saying it 's in dire straits , the other that it 's never been better . yanukovych paints a bleak economic picture , blaming his rival yushchenko for the downturn which followed his election .
" economic policies of these authorities can only be called financial recklessness and economic irresponsibility , " he said recently in kiev .
yushchenko unsurprisingly , says the economy is in good shape . however , his promise of turning ukraine into a new investment paradise has not borne fruit , mostly because investors became wary of the government of his former " orange revolution " partner tymoshenko and her vows to review past questionable privatizations , and because investors were waiting to see the nation 's political landscape after this weekend 's parliamentary poll . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine boxing hero eyes political title in kiev vitali klitschko , the former wbc heavyweight champion and one of ukraine 's most popular public figures , is running for the post of mayor of kiev in march elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.03.2006 belarus opposition figure seized großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police beat protesters in the belarusian capital minsk a high-profile belarussian opposition figure was arrested following a rally in minsk saturday , a day after eu leaders slapped sanctions on president alexander lukashenko . " the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .
talking about minsk , lavrov also said he was " sure that protests like this have little chance of changing anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov sees nothing wrong in the crush of protests in belarus " these people spent several days on the square but we did n't understand what they were hoping for , " said lavrov , apparently confirming moscow 's approval of the status quo in belarus . the minister saw the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as responsible for inciting the belarus protests . " unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .
a foreign ministry spokeswoman said : " this election has shown that belarus is governed by an authoritarian regime that can not be passively observed .

now , a soccer park is to be built in front of parliament for fans to watch and play the beautiful game during the event . before german politicians returned to berlin from bonn and reclaimed the reichstag or parliament in 1999 , the grassy patch in front of one germany 's most historical landmarks was a meeting point where people could get out and enjoy a bit of green in the asphalt jungle of the city . one beloved activity was playing soccer - something that politicians decided was unworthy of republic square , the official name of the area in front of the parliament .
playing ball was prohibited . now that 's set to change during the upcoming world cup in germany .
the city of berlin last week provided relief for the thousands of fans who will be unable to get their hands on tickets for any of the matches , let alone for the six in berlin , including the final : sportswear giant adidas , which has been searching for a proper location in berlin for almost a year , has said it will build a " 13th world cup venue " on republic square . for the city which lost austrian artist andre heller 's glittering opening ceremony after a lawn dispute with fifa at the real berlin world cup venue , it can provide an interesting alternative to just watching matches in bars or at home to soccer supporters from around the world . " for those unable to get tickets for a world cup game , it offers the chance to soak up the atmosphere , " said berlin mayor klaus wowereit . mini-stadium to attract huge crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real olympic stadium will host the world cup final on july 9 the stadium is to be a replica of berlin 's olympic stadium on a scale of 1:3.3 .
up to 10,000 fans can sit in the arena which adidas said will cost tens of million of euros to build .
all 64 world cup games are to be broadcast on giant screens on the grounds at the reichstag .
adidas expects up to 70,000 visitors per day . yet the action will not be limited to passive spectating .
around the stadium , soccer fields will be set up .
tournaments are supposed to be held .
schools are encouraged to take field trips to the park and play soccer .
also , no world cup in germany would be complete without a beer garden .
the public in general should have a good time . even on those few days when soccer players and fans have the day off from the tournament , the mini-stadium will host concerts .
us hip-hop group " the black eyed peas " are scheduled for june 28 .
english singer-songwriter james blunt is scheduled to perform on july 7 . final match pitch to be sold to general public adidas also does not want to chase people away by charging high ticket prices .
the cost to get into the soccer park will be one euro and just three euros to get into the stadium , excluding concerts of course .
all proceeds will go to charity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hopes to generate an atmosphere similar to christo 's wrapped reichstag project when the world cup is over , the cherished grass in front of the reichstag will be replaced . finally , for those fanatics who feel that being at the finals is the only true way to feel the fervor but still ca n't get their hands on those elusive tickets , they can at least smell the grass . this year , for the first time ever , the general public can purchase a potential piece of soccer history - they can already reserve a section of the final match pitch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.03.2006 belarus opposition figure seized großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police beat protesters in the belarusian capital minsk a high-profile belarussian opposition figure was arrested following a rally in minsk saturday , a day after eu leaders slapped sanctions on president alexander lukashenko . " the police took alexander kozulin and several members of his family , as well as other protestors who were walking towards the prison where their comrades are being detained , " nida shidlovskaya , kozulin 's spokeswoman , told afp . kozulin , a former dean of minsk university , was a runner-up in the march 19 presidential election that saw authoritarian belarussian president alexander lukashenko re-elected to a third term in office with 83 percent . the main belarussian opposition leader , alexander milinkevich , came second with 6.1 percent according to official results . riot police were seen putting a man into a police van and passers-by who witnessed the arrest said he was kozulin .
at an anti-lukashenko protest rally of around 7,000 people , kozulin had earlier slammed the belarussian leader , saying : " the last dictator should be sent to the hague -lrb- international crimes -rrb- tribunal .
we call on the united nations to look at the question of belarus . " towards the end of the two-hour rally , kozulin called on opposition supporters to march to the okrestina prison , where hundreds of protestors detained during a massive crackdown over the past week are believed to be held . maxim kapran , 30 , who was with the group that joined kozulin in the march on the prison , said some 2,000 protestors took part but were met by riot police .
clashes between protestors and police broke out , kapran told afp . " one man defended his wife when four police officers attacked her during the clashes .
they kicked him and he lost consciousness .
everyone thought he was dead but he had concussion , " kapran said .
in a separate incident , a spokesman for milinkevich , pavel mazheika , was also arrested after the rally when police stopped the car in which he was travelling in and seized sound equipment , milinkevich 's wife , who was travelling with mazheika and the opposition leader , told afp . eu slaps sanctions the clashes come a day after eu leaders said they would widen restrictions beyond the six visa bans now in place on belarusian officials as they began to ratchet up their stance on belarus - which they called " a sad exception " to democracy in europe .
more travel bans are likely but assets could be also frozen , eu officials said . polish foreign minister stefan meller said the restrictions would come into effect around april 10 and could involve more than a dozen people . " it 's a penalty for -lrb- lukashenko 's -rrb- sins .
this is a fight of good against evil , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu moved to block belarusian officials ' visas " -lrb- lukashenko -rrb- has provided proof that he is a dictator and must be treated as such , " said elmar brok , chairperson of the committee for foreign policy in the european parliament in an interview with dw-world.de. brok agreed that europe should set up travel restrictions against lukashenko and the members of his government .
" in addition , one must think about the possibility of other sanctions , " he added . the move to extend the travel bans came hours after belarus quashed an unprecedented protest against lukashenko , smashing a tent camp in minsk and arresting hundreds of young opposition activists days after the veteran hardliner was swept back into power in elections condemned by the eu and other western nations as " fundamentally flawed . " leaders call for release of captives " we urge the belarus authorities to respect the freedom of assembly and to release the prisoners , " said austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik , whose country holds the eu presidency . the belgian presidency of the leading western election-monitoring body , the osce , also called on the regime to halt the " persecution " of opposition activists and release those arrested . " " the authorities must immediately end the persecution of their opponents , " the head of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , belgian foreign minister karel de gucht , said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the belarusian opposition at the next eu summit german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier condemned the crackdown on the opposition in minsk , saying : " i urge the belarusian government to release the imprisoned opposition politicians " and suggested inviting belarusian opposition leader alexander milinkewitsch and other opposition politicians to the next meeting of eu foreign ministers on april 10 . moscow blames osce of stirring up trouble eu leaders urged belarus ’ giant neighbor russia to help calm the tensions . " we have to be tough , but we also have to speak with our russian friends , that is most important , " said luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn . swedish prime minister göran persson said : " we need to be more firm ... and demonstrate that we are united inside the european union about how we look at the relations with belarus but also with russia . " russia however has played down the police swoop in minsk . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said it was nothing in comparison to the " violence " seen in france . " what i saw in images from minsk can in no way be compared to the violence we can see in certain european capitals , " he said with visible satisfaction in a thinly-veiled reference to student riots in france .
talking about minsk , lavrov also said he was " sure that protests like this have little chance of changing anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov sees nothing wrong in the crush of protests in belarus " these people spent several days on the square but we did n't understand what they were hoping for , " said lavrov , apparently confirming moscow 's approval of the status quo in belarus . the minister saw the organisation for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- as responsible for inciting the belarus protests . " unfortunately , we saw a situation where the osce observer mission began talking about illegitimacy well ahead of the elections with quite a bit of taking sides , thus playing a role of instigator , " lavrov told reporters in moscow . crackdown unacceptable joining the chorus of europe-wide criticism , the slovak foreign ministry called on minsk to end its repression of the opposition supporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has almost run out of friends " belarus can only find its place in the community of democratic states if it returns to a policy that respects democratic standards and freedoms and human rights , " it said in a statement . in budapest , the deputy belarus ambassador was summoned to " convey the hungarian government 's protest at the use of force , " a statement said . non-eu member norway said the crackdown was totally unacceptable .

" we must tell them firmly no ! " he yelled at an adoring , 20,000-strong crowd bathed in a sea of the blue and white ribbons of his campaign . yanukovych 's " them " are the " oranges " - ukraine 's former opposition leaders who led mass protests when results from the presidential election in late 2004 initially gave him victory .
the supreme court eventually threw the ballot out because of massive fraud and ordered a new round of voting , won by the incumbent president viktor yushchenko . to this crowd , the " oranges " are nationalists who managed to stage a coup d 'etat and plan to forcefully " ukrainize " this traditionally russian-speaking region .
they are n't particularly liked in odessa . meanwhile 600 kilometers -lrb- 375 miles -rrb- northwest , in the towns around the western city of lviv , yulia tymoshenko was battling two " thems " at once . former pm looking to eclipse " corrupt " rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yulia tymoshenko will shed the orange this weekend tymoshenko was one of the main leaders of the " orange revolution " but split with yushchenko after he fired her as premier last september .
her " them " are yanukovych 's " forces of revanche " and yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc , whom she is battling for the " orange " electorate and whose leadership she has labeled corrupt . following her sacking , tymoshenko ditched orange paraphernalia for a red heart on a white background and ribbons and flags with the insignia flutter from trees and bushes for several kilometers along the town 's main thoroughfare . tymoshenko 's supporters believe yanukovych is part of a corrupt group of " bandits " that ruled ukraine for a decade under the previous regime and tried to hang on to power through fraud , agents of russia that 's once again trying to subjugate and " russify " ukraine . tymoshenko vows she would never join forces with such people and warns that her former " orange " comrades are considering such a union , that they 're not capable of " standing up to evil . " ukraine is europe-bound regardless of winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuriy yekhanurov says ukraine is on course for europe whoever wins the election on sunday , ukraine ’ s westwards drift towards the rest of europe will continue , according to the prime minister yuriy yekhanurov . however , in an interview with the russian daily izvestia he said that if the pro-russian opposition wins , it would slow down the process by " three or four years " , and that kiev would continue to cooperate with moscow . " if -lrb- president viktor -rrb- yushchenko 's side wins ukraine will enter europe quicker .
if the other side does , the process will be slowed down by three or four years .
but the direction will not change , " yekhanurov said . yekhanurov also said ukraine could continue to cooperate closely with russia who ever wins , especially in the energy sector .
" we are interested in building an extra pipeline -lrb- between the russia-kazakhstan and ukrainian-slovakian border -rrb- , " he said . yushchenko wants victory to pursue reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko and yanukovych : bitter rivals again " as regards the eu ... ukraine should first integrate with europe 's energy system , increase the sales of its electric energy to the west , " he said . yushchenko needs his forces to gain a stable majority in parliament in order to continue reforms aimed at driving ukraine toward western clubs like the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- . although he enjoyed the backing of 70 percent of his countrymen when he assumed power in january 2005 , the slowing economy and infighting within his forces has eroded their support . economy a hot topic in sunday 's poll the state of ukraine 's economy is a hotly debated issue , with one side saying it 's in dire straits , the other that it 's never been better . yanukovych paints a bleak economic picture , blaming his rival yushchenko for the downturn which followed his election .
" economic policies of these authorities can only be called financial recklessness and economic irresponsibility , " he said recently in kiev .
yushchenko unsurprisingly , says the economy is in good shape . however , his promise of turning ukraine into a new investment paradise has not borne fruit , mostly because investors became wary of the government of his former " orange revolution " partner tymoshenko and her vows to review past questionable privatizations , and because investors were waiting to see the nation 's political landscape after this weekend 's parliamentary poll . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine boxing hero eyes political title in kiev vitali klitschko , the former wbc heavyweight champion and one of ukraine 's most popular public figures , is running for the post of mayor of kiev in march elections .

and that despite receiving nationwide recognition this week for her participation in an integration project . " it 's horrible , first you 're honored , then you 're deported , " she said .
" what are they thinking , tearing a family apart that 's lived here for 17 years , and can speak german ?
it 's incomprehensible that we ’ re being deported at all .

" i made an exception for the three older sisters to remain here , at least until they have completed their final school exams , " he said .
" if they complete their exams successfully , and can live independently in germany , then they can certainly stay here in the future .
for the parents and other family members , i did n't feel i could justify making an exception . " a group of hayriye 's teachers and friends ' parents guaranteed to pay the girls ' expenses and started a petition to allow the entire family to remain in germany . in 1989 , when the aydin family first arrived in germany , they were denied asylum seeker status and procured false documents to stay in the country for 17 years .

the children are all active in school , as class representatives , and pupil-teacher mediators . " german president horst köhler has promised to personally look into the aydin case , although he stressed that he could n't make any promises .

" we must tell them firmly no ! " he yelled at an adoring , 20,000-strong crowd bathed in a sea of the blue and white ribbons of his campaign . yanukovych 's " them " are the " oranges " - ukraine 's former opposition leaders who led mass protests when results from the presidential election in late 2004 initially gave him victory .
the supreme court eventually threw the ballot out because of massive fraud and ordered a new round of voting , won by the incumbent president viktor yushchenko . to this crowd , the " oranges " are nationalists who managed to stage a coup d 'etat and plan to forcefully " ukrainize " this traditionally russian-speaking region .
they are n't particularly liked in odessa . meanwhile 600 kilometers -lrb- 375 miles -rrb- northwest , in the towns around the western city of lviv , yulia tymoshenko was battling two " thems " at once . former pm looking to eclipse " corrupt " rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yulia tymoshenko will shed the orange this weekend tymoshenko was one of the main leaders of the " orange revolution " but split with yushchenko after he fired her as premier last september .
her " them " are yanukovych 's " forces of revanche " and yushchenko 's our ukraine bloc , whom she is battling for the " orange " electorate and whose leadership she has labeled corrupt . following her sacking , tymoshenko ditched orange paraphernalia for a red heart on a white background and ribbons and flags with the insignia flutter from trees and bushes for several kilometers along the town 's main thoroughfare . tymoshenko 's supporters believe yanukovych is part of a corrupt group of " bandits " that ruled ukraine for a decade under the previous regime and tried to hang on to power through fraud , agents of russia that 's once again trying to subjugate and " russify " ukraine . tymoshenko vows she would never join forces with such people and warns that her former " orange " comrades are considering such a union , that they 're not capable of " standing up to evil . " ukraine is europe-bound regardless of winner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuriy yekhanurov says ukraine is on course for europe whoever wins the election on sunday , ukraine ’ s westwards drift towards the rest of europe will continue , according to the prime minister yuriy yekhanurov . however , in an interview with the russian daily izvestia he said that if the pro-russian opposition wins , it would slow down the process by " three or four years " , and that kiev would continue to cooperate with moscow . " if -lrb- president viktor -rrb- yushchenko 's side wins ukraine will enter europe quicker .
if the other side does , the process will be slowed down by three or four years .
but the direction will not change , " yekhanurov said . yekhanurov also said ukraine could continue to cooperate closely with russia who ever wins , especially in the energy sector .
" we are interested in building an extra pipeline -lrb- between the russia-kazakhstan and ukrainian-slovakian border -rrb- , " he said . yushchenko wants victory to pursue reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko and yanukovych : bitter rivals again " as regards the eu ... ukraine should first integrate with europe 's energy system , increase the sales of its electric energy to the west , " he said . yushchenko needs his forces to gain a stable majority in parliament in order to continue reforms aimed at driving ukraine toward western clubs like the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- . although he enjoyed the backing of 70 percent of his countrymen when he assumed power in january 2005 , the slowing economy and infighting within his forces has eroded their support . economy a hot topic in sunday 's poll the state of ukraine 's economy is a hotly debated issue , with one side saying it 's in dire straits , the other that it 's never been better . yanukovych paints a bleak economic picture , blaming his rival yushchenko for the downturn which followed his election .
" economic policies of these authorities can only be called financial recklessness and economic irresponsibility , " he said recently in kiev .
yushchenko unsurprisingly , says the economy is in good shape . however , his promise of turning ukraine into a new investment paradise has not borne fruit , mostly because investors became wary of the government of his former " orange revolution " partner tymoshenko and her vows to review past questionable privatizations , and because investors were waiting to see the nation 's political landscape after this weekend 's parliamentary poll . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine boxing hero eyes political title in kiev vitali klitschko , the former wbc heavyweight champion and one of ukraine 's most popular public figures , is running for the post of mayor of kiev in march elections .
-lrb- march 24 , 2006 -rrb- ukraine faces real change , at last the high expectations following ukraine 's " orange revolution " have turned to deep disappointment .
but businesses are relieved as president yuschenko signals he wants to improve conditions for much-needed investors .

and that despite receiving nationwide recognition this week for her participation in an integration project . " it 's horrible , first you 're honored , then you 're deported , " she said .
" what are they thinking , tearing a family apart that 's lived here for 17 years , and can speak german ?
it 's incomprehensible that we ’ re being deported at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a repressed minority in turkey , a number of kurds have fled to europe exception made for three family members for the time being , an exception made by berlin 's interior senator ehrhart körting will allow hayriye and two of her sisters to remain in germany , while her parents and four younger siblings are deported . " i made an exception for the three older sisters to remain here , at least until they have completed their final school exams , " he said .
" if they complete their exams successfully , and can live independently in germany , then they can certainly stay here in the future .
for the parents and other family members , i did n't feel i could justify making an exception . " a group of hayriye 's teachers and friends ' parents guaranteed to pay the girls ' expenses and started a petition to allow the entire family to remain in germany . in 1989 , when the aydin family first arrived in germany , they were denied asylum seeker status and procured false documents to stay in the country for 17 years .
feyyaz aydin , hayriye 's father , said he resorted to lying to german officials because he feared being sent back to turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said he would examine the situation of illegal refugees in germany family " embodies concept of integration " the committee on petitions at the state parliament in berlin , is investigating whether or not the aydins could be allowed to stay in germany .
gerd fitkau , one of the members of the german parliament looking into the case , said he does n't feel anyone in the family should be deported . " the aydins really embody the concept of integration , " he said .
" there are 11 children , including hayriye , who despite being a muslim , campaigned in a berlin initiative against anti-semitism .
the children are all active in school , as class representatives , and pupil-teacher mediators . " german president horst köhler has promised to personally look into the aydin case , although he stressed that he could n't make any promises .
köhler also said he would investigate difficulties with the right of residence for families who have lived as illegal long-term refugees in germany . jane conway -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : citizenship tests a good idea for germany germany should introduce a test for immigrants seeking german citizenship .

now , a soccer park is to be built in front of parliament for fans to watch and play the beautiful game during the event . before german politicians returned to berlin from bonn and reclaimed the reichstag or parliament in 1999 , the grassy patch in front of one germany 's most historical landmarks was a meeting point where people could get out and enjoy a bit of green in the asphalt jungle of the city . one beloved activity was playing soccer - something that politicians decided was unworthy of republic square , the official name of the area in front of the parliament .
playing ball was prohibited . now that 's set to change during the upcoming world cup in germany .
the city of berlin last week provided relief for the thousands of fans who will be unable to get their hands on tickets for any of the matches , let alone for the six in berlin , including the final : sportswear giant adidas , which has been searching for a proper location in berlin for almost a year , has said it will build a " 13th world cup venue " on republic square . for the city which lost austrian artist andre heller 's glittering opening ceremony after a lawn dispute with fifa at the real berlin world cup venue , it can provide an interesting alternative to just watching matches in bars or at home to soccer supporters from around the world . " for those unable to get tickets for a world cup game , it offers the chance to soak up the atmosphere , " said berlin mayor klaus wowereit . mini-stadium to attract huge crowds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real olympic stadium will host the world cup final on july 9 the stadium is to be a replica of berlin 's olympic stadium on a scale of 1:3.3 .
up to 10,000 fans can sit in the arena which adidas said will cost tens of million of euros to build .
all 64 world cup games are to be broadcast on giant screens on the grounds at the reichstag .
adidas expects up to 70,000 visitors per day . yet the action will not be limited to passive spectating .
around the stadium , soccer fields will be set up .
tournaments are supposed to be held .
schools are encouraged to take field trips to the park and play soccer .
also , no world cup in germany would be complete without a beer garden .
the public in general should have a good time . even on those few days when soccer players and fans have the day off from the tournament , the mini-stadium will host concerts .
us hip-hop group " the black eyed peas " are scheduled for june 28 .
english singer-songwriter james blunt is scheduled to perform on july 7 . final match pitch to be sold to general public adidas also does not want to chase people away by charging high ticket prices .
the cost to get into the soccer park will be one euro and just three euros to get into the stadium , excluding concerts of course .
all proceeds will go to charity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the city hopes to generate an atmosphere similar to christo 's wrapped reichstag project when the world cup is over , the cherished grass in front of the reichstag will be replaced . finally , for those fanatics who feel that being at the finals is the only true way to feel the fervor but still ca n't get their hands on those elusive tickets , they can at least smell the grass . this year , for the first time ever , the general public can purchase a potential piece of soccer history - they can already reserve a section of the final match pitch .
german mail-order house quelle has the rights to sell the pitch patches .
the cost : a modest 75 euros . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians incensed over gala cancellation now that the world cup opening extravaganza in berlin has been given the boot , politicians are clambering for some kind of replacement show .

he was jailed for life but has always denied the murder .
in 2002 he took his case to the court of appeal and lost .
his lawyers are seeking a new appeal partly because medical reports suggest he was incapable of the killing .
examinations suggested he was not capable of committing the crime because of his mental disabilities , his legal team will argue .
a second plank to their case is that two new witnesses say they saw armed police at the scene when george was arrested , contrary to what police have insisted .
doubts were raised about his conviction george 's lawyers say this is significant because the only forensic evidence that linked george with the murder was a particle from gunshot residue .
he thinks the presence of armed officers and their involvement in his arrest was responsible for this residue .
the third part to the appeal is previously undisclosed expert profile reports which support george 's defence .

half of sierra leone 's squad of 22 have disappeared , following the 21 who went missing in manchester four years ago .
commonwealth games federation president mike fennell said banning sierra leone would serve no purpose .
" it is not on our agenda at all , " he confirmed .
fennell added there were no plans to stop sierra leone from competing at the 2010 games in new delhi .
he added : " " we recognise that in a number of countries there are considerable hardships and therefore , whether athletes or other citizens , they will go to other countries where they think they will be better off . "
it is not the nicest thing to do to the host country and your team mates to walk out sierra leone team spokesman robert green fennell said all his federation could do was warn athletes that if they tried to stay in a country illegally they would feel the full weight of that nation 's laws .
officially , they have not breached any immigration rules because they have been issued with special visas for the games , valid for another month .
most of the missing sierra leoneans are members of the athletics team , while another is a weightlifter .

" obviously there is a feeling that it is not the nicest thing to do to the host country and your team-mates to walk out , " said sierra leone team spokesman robert green .
they have joined what has become a growing list of unaccounted-for athletes .
earlier this week a boxer from tanzania and a 400m runner from bangladesh went missing , sparking fears they would try to remain in australia illegally .
in the meantime , the police are treating the case as a missing persons investigation and have urged anyone with information about the missing athletes to contact them .

fennell added there were no plans to stop sierra leone from competing at the 2010 games in new delhi .
he added : " " we recognise that in a number of countries there are considerable hardships and therefore , whether athletes or other citizens , they will go to other countries where they think they will be better off . "
it is not the nicest thing to do to the host country and your team mates to walk out sierra leone team spokesman robert green fennell said all his federation could do was warn athletes that if they tried to stay in a country illegally they would feel the full weight of that nation 's laws .
officially , they have not breached any immigration rules because they have been issued with special visas for the games , valid for another month .
most of the missing sierra leoneans are members of the athletics team , while another is a weightlifter .

the home computing initiative was set up to help lower-paid workers afford their own pc and introduce them to information technology .
half a million people took advantage of generous tax breaks to buy a home computer at discounts of up to 50 % .
but on wednesday the chancellor announced the project would end on 6 april , which will leave the 60 companies which supply the computers and run the schemes with no income .
chief executive of onecall technologies graeme mitchell told bbc radio 4 's money box programme : " ten days ' notice we 've been given and we 've just lost our jobs .
" onecall will lose 100 jobs and those indirectly related will amount to another 200 .
" it 's an industry of about 2000 people .
how can you just pull the plug on it at 10 days notice ? "
it was not just graeme mitchell who was taken by surprise .
the department of trade and industry , which runs the scheme , had only offered a plan to its own staff on march 15 , just in time to get the scheme approved .
but colleagues at the department for work and pensions were not so lucky .
a spokesman confirmed to the programme it had begun to assess interest in the scheme but had now scrapped its plans as there was not time to get them finished before the 6 april deadline .
soaring cost the scheme began in 1999 but really took off after it was re-launched in 2003 .
by paying for the computer over three years out of their wages , the scheme allowed both sides to avoid tax and national insurance on the payments . "
tax exemption is in some cases being used beyond the scope of its original intention " hm treasury spokesman companies also avoided vat by supplying the computers with some work-based software .
although technically a loan , at the end of the scheme the employer normally allowed the staff to keep the equipment .
the scheme was so attractive , the cost to the exchequer soared from its original estimate of £ 5 million to around £ 150 million a year .
abuse the treasury told the programme it had clear evidence the tax advantages of the scheme were being abused .
" tax exemption is in some cases being used beyond the scope of its original intention .
some hci providers offer packages including items such as games consoles and home entertainment centres and allow employees to buy equipment rather than borrow it as intended , " a spokesman said .
but graeme mitchell denied there is significant abuse .
" that 's totally untrue , " he said .
" there may be cases , but if i look at my business -lsb- for example -rsb- with a huge uk retailer , all that has been sold to them is thousands of units , all pcs and laptops , all at low-end income brackets , none of them getting consoles , all pc technology .
that 's where the business is . "
he called on the government to rethink its plans .
the treasury told the bbc there would be no change .
but the programme understands that officials may meet industry representatives in the next few days .
meanwhile a website has been launched to save the tax relief .
existing schemes , and those where contracts are signed before will be allowed to run for their three year term .
the treasury said it could not comment on any job losses .
it will focus its support for it on groups with the poorest access to it .
but no plans will be announced until 2007 .
bbc radio 4 's money box will be broadcast on saturday , 25 march , 2006 , at 1204 gmt .

russell toomey and phillip myles , from innercity pirates , were tracked down after organisers appealed for information .
they were inundated by 200 emails on the duo who were pictured on the festival 's online gallery .
russell and phillip will now perform at the prestigious 3 april launch .
singer russell and drummer phillip can often be spotted on the streets of cardiff busking and playing in venues like the barfly and clwb ifor bach as four-piece indie rock band innercity pirates .
we 're looking forward to upgrading from a muddy campsite to a venue russell toomey russell said : " last year was the 10th year i 've been to a festival in reading .
it 's the best event around so it 's an honour to be invited to perform at the launch .
" we 're looking forward to upgrading from a muddy campsite to a venue . "
innercity pirates used to be known as my red cell and were signed to v2 , the same label as the stereophonics and paul weller .
they even played the festival they are set to launch .
said russell : " i performed at the festival in 2004 on the carling stage with my previous band my red cell so i know how to handle a reading festival audience ! "
