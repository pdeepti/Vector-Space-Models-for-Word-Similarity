program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2006 youth teaching tolerance to youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are proving effective in spreading the anti-racist message to other youth in germany , not only neo-nazis are behind anti-semitic attacks , young radical islamists are often also to blame .
one project is trying to do something about it by using young people to fight racism among the young . the final bell has rung at the walter gropius school in the berlin district of neukölln and most students are outside playing soccer or eating ice cream .
but four young women , yasmina , ezgi , sarah and tugba , have chosen to stay in a stifling classroom for the afternoon where they 're leafing through history books and talking about what they find there . on a chalkboard , someone has written extremist right-wing slogans such as " the holocaust never happened " that the women have crossed out .
next to the offending statements they 've written facts about the persecution of the jews and put up photographs of holocaust victims and concentration camps . it 's all part of the training the four have been undergoing for a year now to become youth leaders . young mediators increasingly , teachers have watched anti-semitic attitudes develop among immigrant children who are connected with the conflict in the middle east .
to counter this tendency , youth leaders are being trained to act as conflict-resolution mediators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitism is not just a problem of europe 's past a small group of students are being given two years of training so that they can share their knowledge about anti-semitism with their peers .
this anglo-american concept is based on the fact that young people have more credibility when communicating with their own peer group than teachers or other adults do . yasmina , a 17-year-old german-algerian , has been a youth leader from the program 's beginning and in the course of her training , has come to see anti-semitism as a form of racism .
in her view , if neo-nazis use negative words to refer to jews one day , soon they will use epithets to talk about turks . " we want to do something about that , " she said .
the youth leaders ' strategy is not to just yell back , but to use factual arguments to counter their outbursts and untruths . " we basically want to expose their stupidity , " she said . religion as a bridge youth leader is a nationwide project , which has its origins in five schools around berlin and potsdam .
isabell enzenbach is one of the project 's heads who focuses particularly on muslim students , such as those at the walter gropius school .
religion has proven itself to be a " good bridge " between the two cultures , she said . " take eating kosher , for example .
muslims have similar dietary requirements even though they call it halal , " she said .
" it 's the same with clothing customs and religious services .
muslim youth are able to easily understand that from the very beginning . " all the four young women in this training course wear fashionable shirts , low-slung pants and colorful shoes .
they don headscarves only in the mosque or when they want a fashionable accessory .
at the same time , they describe themselves as religious and as being closely connected with islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have also been attacked in germany because of their religion because they know how it feels to be attacked because of their religion , they are also more sensitive to anti-semitic language , which is apparently fairly widespread among people in their age group .
it often takes the form of anti-semitic jokes in the schoolyard or on the bus . youth leaders learn facts about the holocaust and receive training in logical reasoning and role play .
they visit jewish community centers and talk with holocaust survivors and jewish youth of their own age . parental support most parents are supportive of their daughters ' engagement , even though at the beginning there was some skepticism , for example , from ezgi 's mother . " she did n't like it so much that i was participating in the program , " ezgi said .
" she had made anti-semitic comments herself before and blamed the jews for the conflict in the middle east . " but ezgi was able to use reason and facts to convince of her mother otherwise , and to see the conflict from another perspective .
now her mother is more sensitive when it comes to such comments . in a few weeks , ezgi and yasmina are going to become trainers themselves , since they 've organized a project at their school for students in lower grades .
they want to pass on their arguments against anti-semitism and help instill a sense of justice and tolerance in the younger students .

one project is trying to do something about it by using young people to fight racism among the young . the final bell has rung at the walter gropius school in the berlin district of neukölln and most students are outside playing soccer or eating ice cream .
but four young women , yasmina , ezgi , sarah and tugba , have chosen to stay in a stifling classroom for the afternoon where they 're leafing through history books and talking about what they find there . on a chalkboard , someone has written extremist right-wing slogans such as " the holocaust never happened " that the women have crossed out .
next to the offending statements they 've written facts about the persecution of the jews and put up photographs of holocaust victims and concentration camps . it 's all part of the training the four have been undergoing for a year now to become youth leaders . young mediators increasingly , teachers have watched anti-semitic attitudes develop among immigrant children who are connected with the conflict in the middle east .
to counter this tendency , youth leaders are being trained to act as conflict-resolution mediators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitism is not just a problem of europe 's past a small group of students are being given two years of training so that they can share their knowledge about anti-semitism with their peers .
this anglo-american concept is based on the fact that young people have more credibility when communicating with their own peer group than teachers or other adults do . yasmina , a 17-year-old german-algerian , has been a youth leader from the program 's beginning and in the course of her training , has come to see anti-semitism as a form of racism .
in her view , if neo-nazis use negative words to refer to jews one day , soon they will use epithets to talk about turks . " we want to do something about that , " she said .
the youth leaders ' strategy is not to just yell back , but to use factual arguments to counter their outbursts and untruths . " we basically want to expose their stupidity , " she said . religion as a bridge youth leader is a nationwide project , which has its origins in five schools around berlin and potsdam .
isabell enzenbach is one of the project 's heads who focuses particularly on muslim students , such as those at the walter gropius school .
religion has proven itself to be a " good bridge " between the two cultures , she said . " take eating kosher , for example .
muslims have similar dietary requirements even though they call it halal , " she said .
" it 's the same with clothing customs and religious services .
muslim youth are able to easily understand that from the very beginning . " all the four young women in this training course wear fashionable shirts , low-slung pants and colorful shoes .
they don headscarves only in the mosque or when they want a fashionable accessory .
at the same time , they describe themselves as religious and as being closely connected with islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have also been attacked in germany because of their religion because they know how it feels to be attacked because of their religion , they are also more sensitive to anti-semitic language , which is apparently fairly widespread among people in their age group .
it often takes the form of anti-semitic jokes in the schoolyard or on the bus . youth leaders learn facts about the holocaust and receive training in logical reasoning and role play .
they visit jewish community centers and talk with holocaust survivors and jewish youth of their own age . parental support most parents are supportive of their daughters ' engagement , even though at the beginning there was some skepticism , for example , from ezgi 's mother . " she did n't like it so much that i was participating in the program , " ezgi said .
" she had made anti-semitic comments herself before and blamed the jews for the conflict in the middle east . " but ezgi was able to use reason and facts to convince of her mother otherwise , and to see the conflict from another perspective .
now her mother is more sensitive when it comes to such comments . in a few weeks , ezgi and yasmina are going to become trainers themselves , since they 've organized a project at their school for students in lower grades .

the state of thuringia is the nerve center of sophisticated and innovative optical technology . former communist east germany may today be associated with renovated prefabricated housing blocks and empty city centers .
but the city of jena in the eastern german state of thuringia effortlessly defies that image . the place is a hive of activity these days .
not only is it a major center for the optics industry there is also a technology and innovations park with around 60 firms and several research centers on the campus of the university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of jenoptik with diode lasers .
one of the most innovative companies is jenoptik which focuses on six areas of expertise .
according to jenoptik 's norbert thiel , lasers and particularly diode lasers are an important focus of attention and will continue to be so in the future . " it 's very clear the laser processing material markets will be one of our main investments in the future .
a huge market which is coming up is the laser soldering and laser welding , " said thiel . " and the second point of diode lasers is the medicine market .
for example , hair removal is a huge market for laser diodes . " aerospace and back to earth another area that jenoptik is increasingly trying to gain a foothold in is aerospace . the famous multi-spectral camera was developed in jena for the russian mir space project .
norbert thiel points out that today jenoptik is very active in a current aerospace project called rapid eye . " we analyze with this camera from space the chlorophyll content of the earth so we can make direct earth observations , " thiel pointed out .
" we are a market leader in the field of sensor technology .
we are n't intending to assemble and design satellites but we are very much focused on this technology in the future . " back on earth , life is destined to get difficult for speeding motorists following the work done by jenoptik together with its partner company robot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motorists will have to watch out next time they 're speeding jenoptik has developed a speed measurement system based on lasers .
and , says thiel , the future will be in digital speed cameras .
so there will be no film to replace and a speeding motorist wo n't even know he 's been caught . " we have a lot of expertise here .
if you measure a distance five times in very short pulses you get the velocity , you get the speed of a car .
we developed a speed measurement system based on lasers . so digital camera , the future will be an infrared flash . " cures for cancer and multiple sclerosis jena is also home to a range of top-notch research institutes such as the institute for physical high technology which performs research and development projects in the areas of magnetics , quantum electronics , micro-systems and laser technology . a further top address for cutting-edge research is the renowned beutenberg campus in jena .
it includes several research institutes which link the fields of physics and optics to new applications in the life sciences . wacker biotech is a prominent example .
its core focus is in the manufacture of so-called biologics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new class of molecules is hoped to find cures for cancers " these are active ingredients for pharmaceuticals .
this is a new class of molecules which developed during the last , i would say , 30 years and what we normally know is so called small molecules , " explained wacker 's anke suter .
" they 're used in the treatment of cancers , multiple sclerosis and because they are proteins they can act in a way that synthesized molecules ca n't currently .
this is a new market and it is strongly growing with an average growth rate of 16 per cent , " suter added . " software is the key driver " another big name on the jena research landscape is carl zeiss , which was founded in 1846 as a workshop for precision mechanics and optics in jena and quickly gained a worldwide reputation for the high quality of its products . " i think innovation is the key of what our business is all about , " said ulrich simon , president and chief executive of carl zeiss micro imaging in jena .
" innovation is the core driver .
we generate a lot of patents , roughly two patents a day over the entire organization , " he added . it 's obvious that the future for carl zeiss lies in automation and miniaturization . " to really turn data in information knowledge - i think that will be the key driver for the future business , " said simon .
" software is one of the key drivers .
what you want to do in the end is you just put a sample into the laptop and get out the information , by just hitting one button .

bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who delivered the cross for ballack 's header , then made it 2-0 after 37 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger , ballack , frings and podolski celebrated on friday schweinsteiger produced a fierce free-kick from 30 yards that thundered past goalkeeper oscar cordoba into the back of the net . it was a second goal in four days for schweinsteiger who scored the equalizer in the 2-2 draw with japan on tuesday . the german league 's top-scorer miroslav klose and his polish-born striking team-mate lukas podolski should both have added to the goals tally in the first half but lacked composure at the decisive moment . the second half was more of the same but colombia finally had a noteworthy attack on the hour mark but elkin soto headed over the crossbar .
in the 68th minute substitute tim borowski , only on the pitch seven minutes , was afforded too much space in the penalty area and finished with aplomb . kli n sma n n has n o regrets " i was delighted that the team got some confidence before the tournament , " klinsmann said .
" it was good to finish with a win and we are now very hungry for the opening game against costa rica -lrb- on june 9 -rrb- .
the fans , the players and myself all just want the tournament to start . " since taking charge in august 2004 klinsmann has raised a few eyebrows with his attacking tactics - often at the expense of defense - but the coach said he has no regrets . " we have had some up and downs but we knew the deadline was next friday in munich , " he said .
" we believe in this team .
i knew when i took over the job that i could not please everyone .
my goal was to build a good team . " in the past germany have perhaps not been known as an attacking team but now they are reminiscent of a kevin keegan team that adopts the policy of outscoring opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things did n't look so great in italy in march however in march italy thumped germany 4-1 in florence to expose their defensive shortcomings and japan showed them up again in tuesday 's 2-2 friendly draw in leverkusen . " we will not alter our philosophy at the world cup , " klinsmann said .
" we want to get forward quickly and offer attractive soccer to the public .
it is wrong to say we have problems in defense .
we just have a problem switching off when we lose the ball .

do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "

but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .

they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .

it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .
but i do say i 'm hopeful , they could get up there .
and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .

i n 1990 , schäuble was paralyzed after he was shot by a n assassi n . dw-tv : as germa n y 's i n terior mi n ister you are also i n charge of sport policy .
how far do you thi n k germa n y will go i n the soccer world cup ? schäuble : i 'm not only the sports minister ; i 'm also an enthusiastic soccer fan .
and a real fan always hopes his team will win . germa n y hosted the world cup fi n als o n ce before , 32 years ago .
west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "
some politicia n s , some orga n izatio n s , also some embassies , are war n i n g fa n s with a clear n o n -europea n backgrou n d , n ot to go i n to certai n areas , particularly i n easter n germa n y , sayi n g it 's too da n gerous for them there , that too ma n y pote n tially viole n t right-wi n g extremists live there .
are there " n o-go-areas " for foreig n ers i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants germans to stand up against neo-nazis there must n't be .
but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . the whole stadium was build in that time - that would mean tear down the whole stadium ?
by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .
they do not bear a swastika or any other nationalistic emblems .
to remove and / or destroy them would emanate the nazis ' book burning . - ola f he n n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's colosseum should the coliseum in rome be torn down because thousands upon thousands of christians were persecuted and massacred there in the most hideous of ways ?
i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .
perplexed i asked him how come that he surrounds him with these kinds of objects .
he said : " but i survived and they are dead . "
his parents fled with him from the island of rhodes shortly before the whole jewish population of rhodes was imprisoned and killed . - b ert schroer the very fact that these statues have remained in public view is just another testament to german ambivalence regarding their past .
i say leave the sculptures there , illustrating to the world the persistent insincerity germany continues to exhibit for their prior heinous activities . - kurt brick n er bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddha statue that was later destroyed by afghanistan 's taliban regime art of whatever origins should be respected and understood for what it is : a reflection of a period in time - whether is a good or a bad period .
the taliban blew up the mountain buddahs .
it was a horrible thing to do .
art should be viewed with respect , no matter how different our religious or political views .
intolerance was the base for conflict .
what can make free nations different from the nazis and other fanatic group is precisely : tolerance . - g. m. rodriguez compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .

was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?

i n 1990 , schäuble was paralyzed after he was shot by a n assassi n . dw-tv : as germa n y 's i n terior mi n ister you are also i n charge of sport policy .
how far do you thi n k germa n y will go i n the soccer world cup ? schäuble : i 'm not only the sports minister ; i 'm also an enthusiastic soccer fan .
and a real fan always hopes his team will win . germa n y hosted the world cup fi n als o n ce before , 32 years ago .
west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "
some politicia n s , some orga n izatio n s , also some embassies , are war n i n g fa n s with a clear n o n -europea n backgrou n d , n ot to go i n to certai n areas , particularly i n easter n germa n y , sayi n g it 's too da n gerous for them there , that too ma n y pote n tially viole n t right-wi n g extremists live there .
are there " n o-go-areas " for foreig n ers i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants germans to stand up against neo-nazis there must n't be .
but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .
and i believe it will change . right-wi n g extremists have a n n ou n ced they wa n t to stir up trouble at the world cup - for example at the game betwee n ira n a n d a n gola i n leipzig . are you i n te n di n g to ba n n eo-nazi demo n stratio n s outside the stadiums ? of course , but the federal states are responsible for this , rather than me .
they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .
if he should decide to come a n d watch his team play here i n germa n y , would he be welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of iran 's national soccer team it is clear that we will adhere to international law , that we will fulfill the guarantees we gave to fifa when we applied to host the world cup .
it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .
but i do say i 'm hopeful , they could get up there .
and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .
actually that 's all 31 other teams .
the key thing would be us winning .
and if we do n't , it will still be a great world cup , that 's clear . christian f. trippe interviewed wolfgang schäuble send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security risks reassessed as us world cup team arrives the arrival of the us team to take up their heavily-guarded headquarters in a central hotel in hamburg was an early test for the world cup 's security arrangements .

my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "
some politicia n s , some orga n izatio n s , also some embassies , are war n i n g fa n s with a clear n o n -europea n backgrou n d , n ot to go i n to certai n areas , particularly i n easter n germa n y , sayi n g it 's too da n gerous for them there , that too ma n y pote n tially viole n t right-wi n g extremists live there .

but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .
and i believe it will change . right-wi n g extremists have a n n ou n ced they wa n t to stir up trouble at the world cup - for example at the game betwee n ira n a n d a n gola i n leipzig . are you i n te n di n g to ba n n eo-nazi demo n stratio n s outside the stadiums ? of course , but the federal states are responsible for this , rather than me .
they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .
if he should decide to come a n d watch his team play here i n germa n y , would he be welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of iran 's national soccer team it is clear that we will adhere to international law , that we will fulfill the guarantees we gave to fifa when we applied to host the world cup .
it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .
but i do say i 'm hopeful , they could get up there .
and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .
actually that 's all 31 other teams .

that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .
and i believe it will change . right-wi n g extremists have a n n ou n ced they wa n t to stir up trouble at the world cup - for example at the game betwee n ira n a n d a n gola i n leipzig . are you i n te n di n g to ba n n eo-nazi demo n stratio n s outside the stadiums ? of course , but the federal states are responsible for this , rather than me .
they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .
if he should decide to come a n d watch his team play here i n germa n y , would he be welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of iran 's national soccer team it is clear that we will adhere to international law , that we will fulfill the guarantees we gave to fifa when we applied to host the world cup .
it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .
but i do say i 'm hopeful , they could get up there .
and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .
actually that 's all 31 other teams .
the key thing would be us winning .
and if we do n't , it will still be a great world cup , that 's clear . christian f. trippe interviewed wolfgang schäuble send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security risks reassessed as us world cup team arrives the arrival of the us team to take up their heavily-guarded headquarters in a central hotel in hamburg was an early test for the world cup 's security arrangements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2006 german interior minister : " people will feel safe " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble says he 's an enthusiastic soccer fan himself in an interview with dw-tv , german interior and sports minister wolfgang schäuble said that all measures had been taken to ensure that the biggest event in germany 's modern history will be safe . wolfga n g schäuble , a member of germa n y 's christia n democratic u n io n , is curre n tly servi n g as the cou n try 's federal i n terior mi n ister for the seco n d time after previously occupyi n g that positio n from 1989 to 1991 .
i n 1990 , schäuble was paralyzed after he was shot by a n assassi n . dw-tv : as germa n y 's i n terior mi n ister you are also i n charge of sport policy .
how far do you thi n k germa n y will go i n the soccer world cup ? schäuble : i 'm not only the sports minister ; i 'm also an enthusiastic soccer fan .
and a real fan always hopes his team will win . germa n y hosted the world cup fi n als o n ce before , 32 years ago .
west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "
some politicia n s , some orga n izatio n s , also some embassies , are war n i n g fa n s with a clear n o n -europea n backgrou n d , n ot to go i n to certai n areas , particularly i n easter n germa n y , sayi n g it 's too da n gerous for them there , that too ma n y pote n tially viole n t right-wi n g extremists live there .
are there " n o-go-areas " for foreig n ers i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants germans to stand up against neo-nazis there must n't be .
but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .
and i believe it will change . right-wi n g extremists have a n n ou n ced they wa n t to stir up trouble at the world cup - for example at the game betwee n ira n a n d a n gola i n leipzig . are you i n te n di n g to ba n n eo-nazi demo n stratio n s outside the stadiums ? of course , but the federal states are responsible for this , rather than me .
they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .
if he should decide to come a n d watch his team play here i n germa n y , would he be welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of iran 's national soccer team it is clear that we will adhere to international law , that we will fulfill the guarantees we gave to fifa when we applied to host the world cup .
it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .
but i do say i 'm hopeful , they could get up there .
and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .
actually that 's all 31 other teams .
the key thing would be us winning .
and if we do n't , it will still be a great world cup , that 's clear . christian f. trippe interviewed wolfgang schäuble send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security risks reassessed as us world cup team arrives the arrival of the us team to take up their heavily-guarded headquarters in a central hotel in hamburg was an early test for the world cup 's security arrangements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 03.06.2006 should nazi era sculptures stay at berlin 's olympic stadium ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl albiker 's statues at the stadium many dw-world.de readers commented on the controversy surrounding nazi era sculptures that can still be seen at berlin 's olympic stadium .
most backed keeping the art in place as a reminder of germany darkest past . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . the whole stadium was build in that time - that would mean tear down the whole stadium ?
by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .
they do not bear a swastika or any other nationalistic emblems .
to remove and / or destroy them would emanate the nazis ' book burning . - ola f he n n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's colosseum should the coliseum in rome be torn down because thousands upon thousands of christians were persecuted and massacred there in the most hideous of ways ?
i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . the whole stadium was build in that time - that would mean tear down the whole stadium ?
by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .
they do not bear a swastika or any other nationalistic emblems .
to remove and / or destroy them would emanate the nazis ' book burning . - ola f he n n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's colosseum should the coliseum in rome be torn down because thousands upon thousands of christians were persecuted and massacred there in the most hideous of ways ?
i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .
perplexed i asked him how come that he surrounds him with these kinds of objects .
he said : " but i survived and they are dead . "
his parents fled with him from the island of rhodes shortly before the whole jewish population of rhodes was imprisoned and killed . - b ert schroer the very fact that these statues have remained in public view is just another testament to german ambivalence regarding their past .

bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who delivered the cross for ballack 's header , then made it 2-0 after 37 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger , ballack , frings and podolski celebrated on friday schweinsteiger produced a fierce free-kick from 30 yards that thundered past goalkeeper oscar cordoba into the back of the net . it was a second goal in four days for schweinsteiger who scored the equalizer in the 2-2 draw with japan on tuesday . the german league 's top-scorer miroslav klose and his polish-born striking team-mate lukas podolski should both have added to the goals tally in the first half but lacked composure at the decisive moment . the second half was more of the same but colombia finally had a noteworthy attack on the hour mark but elkin soto headed over the crossbar .
in the 68th minute substitute tim borowski , only on the pitch seven minutes , was afforded too much space in the penalty area and finished with aplomb . kli n sma n n has n o regrets " i was delighted that the team got some confidence before the tournament , " klinsmann said .
" it was good to finish with a win and we are now very hungry for the opening game against costa rica -lrb- on june 9 -rrb- .
the fans , the players and myself all just want the tournament to start . " since taking charge in august 2004 klinsmann has raised a few eyebrows with his attacking tactics - often at the expense of defense - but the coach said he has no regrets . " we have had some up and downs but we knew the deadline was next friday in munich , " he said .
" we believe in this team .
i knew when i took over the job that i could not please everyone .
my goal was to build a good team . " in the past germany have perhaps not been known as an attacking team but now they are reminiscent of a kevin keegan team that adopts the policy of outscoring opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things did n't look so great in italy in march however in march italy thumped germany 4-1 in florence to expose their defensive shortcomings and japan showed them up again in tuesday 's 2-2 friendly draw in leverkusen . " we will not alter our philosophy at the world cup , " klinsmann said .
" we want to get forward quickly and offer attractive soccer to the public .
it is wrong to say we have problems in defense .
we just have a problem switching off when we lose the ball .

" i do n't believe that there will be any kind of situation such as 1972 , an attack on a team , or athletes being taken hostage , " schäuble said in saturday 's edition of the süddeutsche zeitu n g daily . crowds n ot teams prese n t most likely target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble -lrb- right -rrb- admitted concerns about policing public areas but schäuble said authorities were more concerned at ensuring security for the large gatherings of supporters who will watch world cup matches on huge screens erected in public places across the country . " this time , the world cup is everywhere because we are going to have giant screens set up where people are going to gather , " he said .
" if there are going to be attacks , they are not going to be against the teams or players but against these gatherings . " uneasiness at maintaining public order where fans gather was heightened after a rampage on may 26 by a knife-wielding teenager in berlin that left 36 people injured . the attack took place as half a million people filed away from an opening ceremony for the city 's new lehrter bahnhof railway station , touted as europe 's largest international rail hub . " you ca n't really prevent something such as this happening , " schäuble said . however authorities would consider banning the sale of alcohol in and around world cup stadiums if " circumstances demanded , " schäuble said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teenage attacker triggers debate about world cup security a 16-year-old ran amok at the opening of berlin 's new central station saturday , sparking new doubts about safety during the imminent world cup and prompting politicians to call for a stricter response to youth crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 03.06.2006 should nazi era sculptures stay at berlin 's olympic stadium ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl albiker 's statues at the stadium many dw-world.de readers commented on the controversy surrounding nazi era sculptures that can still be seen at berlin 's olympic stadium .
most backed keeping the art in place as a reminder of germany darkest past . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . the whole stadium was build in that time - that would mean tear down the whole stadium ?
by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .
they do not bear a swastika or any other nationalistic emblems .
to remove and / or destroy them would emanate the nazis ' book burning . - ola f he n n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's colosseum should the coliseum in rome be torn down because thousands upon thousands of christians were persecuted and massacred there in the most hideous of ways ?
i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .
perplexed i asked him how come that he surrounds him with these kinds of objects .
he said : " but i survived and they are dead . "
his parents fled with him from the island of rhodes shortly before the whole jewish population of rhodes was imprisoned and killed . - b ert schroer the very fact that these statues have remained in public view is just another testament to german ambivalence regarding their past .
i say leave the sculptures there , illustrating to the world the persistent insincerity germany continues to exhibit for their prior heinous activities . - kurt brick n er bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddha statue that was later destroyed by afghanistan 's taliban regime art of whatever origins should be respected and understood for what it is : a reflection of a period in time - whether is a good or a bad period .
the taliban blew up the mountain buddahs .
it was a horrible thing to do .
art should be viewed with respect , no matter how different our religious or political views .
intolerance was the base for conflict .
what can make free nations different from the nazis and other fanatic group is precisely : tolerance . - g. m. rodriguez compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who delivered the cross for ballack 's header , then made it 2-0 after 37 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger , ballack , frings and podolski celebrated on friday schweinsteiger produced a fierce free-kick from 30 yards that thundered past goalkeeper oscar cordoba into the back of the net . it was a second goal in four days for schweinsteiger who scored the equalizer in the 2-2 draw with japan on tuesday . the german league 's top-scorer miroslav klose and his polish-born striking team-mate lukas podolski should both have added to the goals tally in the first half but lacked composure at the decisive moment . the second half was more of the same but colombia finally had a noteworthy attack on the hour mark but elkin soto headed over the crossbar .
in the 68th minute substitute tim borowski , only on the pitch seven minutes , was afforded too much space in the penalty area and finished with aplomb . kli n sma n n has n o regrets " i was delighted that the team got some confidence before the tournament , " klinsmann said .
" it was good to finish with a win and we are now very hungry for the opening game against costa rica -lrb- on june 9 -rrb- .
the fans , the players and myself all just want the tournament to start . " since taking charge in august 2004 klinsmann has raised a few eyebrows with his attacking tactics - often at the expense of defense - but the coach said he has no regrets . " we have had some up and downs but we knew the deadline was next friday in munich , " he said .
" we believe in this team .
i knew when i took over the job that i could not please everyone .
my goal was to build a good team . " in the past germany have perhaps not been known as an attacking team but now they are reminiscent of a kevin keegan team that adopts the policy of outscoring opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things did n't look so great in italy in march however in march italy thumped germany 4-1 in florence to expose their defensive shortcomings and japan showed them up again in tuesday 's 2-2 friendly draw in leverkusen . " we will not alter our philosophy at the world cup , " klinsmann said .

i n 1990 , schäuble was paralyzed after he was shot by a n assassi n . dw-tv : as germa n y 's i n terior mi n ister you are also i n charge of sport policy .
how far do you thi n k germa n y will go i n the soccer world cup ? schäuble : i 'm not only the sports minister ; i 'm also an enthusiastic soccer fan .
and a real fan always hopes his team will win . germa n y hosted the world cup fi n als o n ce before , 32 years ago .
west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "
some politicia n s , some orga n izatio n s , also some embassies , are war n i n g fa n s with a clear n o n -europea n backgrou n d , n ot to go i n to certai n areas , particularly i n easter n germa n y , sayi n g it 's too da n gerous for them there , that too ma n y pote n tially viole n t right-wi n g extremists live there .
are there " n o-go-areas " for foreig n ers i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants germans to stand up against neo-nazis there must n't be .
but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .
and i believe it will change . right-wi n g extremists have a n n ou n ced they wa n t to stir up trouble at the world cup - for example at the game betwee n ira n a n d a n gola i n leipzig . are you i n te n di n g to ba n n eo-nazi demo n stratio n s outside the stadiums ? of course , but the federal states are responsible for this , rather than me .
they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .
if he should decide to come a n d watch his team play here i n germa n y , would he be welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of iran 's national soccer team it is clear that we will adhere to international law , that we will fulfill the guarantees we gave to fifa when we applied to host the world cup .
it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .
but i do say i 'm hopeful , they could get up there .
and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .
actually that 's all 31 other teams .

how far do you thi n k germa n y will go i n the soccer world cup ? schäuble : i 'm not only the sports minister ; i 'm also an enthusiastic soccer fan .

west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "

are there " n o-go-areas " for foreig n ers i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants germans to stand up against neo-nazis there must n't be .
but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .
and i believe it will change . right-wi n g extremists have a n n ou n ced they wa n t to stir up trouble at the world cup - for example at the game betwee n ira n a n d a n gola i n leipzig . are you i n te n di n g to ba n n eo-nazi demo n stratio n s outside the stadiums ? of course , but the federal states are responsible for this , rather than me .
they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .
if he should decide to come a n d watch his team play here i n germa n y , would he be welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of iran 's national soccer team it is clear that we will adhere to international law , that we will fulfill the guarantees we gave to fifa when we applied to host the world cup .
it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .
but i do say i 'm hopeful , they could get up there .
and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2006 youth teaching tolerance to youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are proving effective in spreading the anti-racist message to other youth in germany , not only neo-nazis are behind anti-semitic attacks , young radical islamists are often also to blame .
one project is trying to do something about it by using young people to fight racism among the young . the final bell has rung at the walter gropius school in the berlin district of neukölln and most students are outside playing soccer or eating ice cream .
but four young women , yasmina , ezgi , sarah and tugba , have chosen to stay in a stifling classroom for the afternoon where they 're leafing through history books and talking about what they find there . on a chalkboard , someone has written extremist right-wing slogans such as " the holocaust never happened " that the women have crossed out .
next to the offending statements they 've written facts about the persecution of the jews and put up photographs of holocaust victims and concentration camps . it 's all part of the training the four have been undergoing for a year now to become youth leaders . young mediators increasingly , teachers have watched anti-semitic attitudes develop among immigrant children who are connected with the conflict in the middle east .
to counter this tendency , youth leaders are being trained to act as conflict-resolution mediators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitism is not just a problem of europe 's past a small group of students are being given two years of training so that they can share their knowledge about anti-semitism with their peers .
this anglo-american concept is based on the fact that young people have more credibility when communicating with their own peer group than teachers or other adults do . yasmina , a 17-year-old german-algerian , has been a youth leader from the program 's beginning and in the course of her training , has come to see anti-semitism as a form of racism .
in her view , if neo-nazis use negative words to refer to jews one day , soon they will use epithets to talk about turks . " we want to do something about that , " she said .
the youth leaders ' strategy is not to just yell back , but to use factual arguments to counter their outbursts and untruths . " we basically want to expose their stupidity , " she said . religion as a bridge youth leader is a nationwide project , which has its origins in five schools around berlin and potsdam .
isabell enzenbach is one of the project 's heads who focuses particularly on muslim students , such as those at the walter gropius school .
religion has proven itself to be a " good bridge " between the two cultures , she said . " take eating kosher , for example .
muslims have similar dietary requirements even though they call it halal , " she said .
" it 's the same with clothing customs and religious services .
muslim youth are able to easily understand that from the very beginning . " all the four young women in this training course wear fashionable shirts , low-slung pants and colorful shoes .
they don headscarves only in the mosque or when they want a fashionable accessory .
at the same time , they describe themselves as religious and as being closely connected with islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have also been attacked in germany because of their religion because they know how it feels to be attacked because of their religion , they are also more sensitive to anti-semitic language , which is apparently fairly widespread among people in their age group .
it often takes the form of anti-semitic jokes in the schoolyard or on the bus . youth leaders learn facts about the holocaust and receive training in logical reasoning and role play .
they visit jewish community centers and talk with holocaust survivors and jewish youth of their own age . parental support most parents are supportive of their daughters ' engagement , even though at the beginning there was some skepticism , for example , from ezgi 's mother . " she did n't like it so much that i was participating in the program , " ezgi said .
" she had made anti-semitic comments herself before and blamed the jews for the conflict in the middle east . " but ezgi was able to use reason and facts to convince of her mother otherwise , and to see the conflict from another perspective .
now her mother is more sensitive when it comes to such comments . in a few weeks , ezgi and yasmina are going to become trainers themselves , since they 've organized a project at their school for students in lower grades .
they want to pass on their arguments against anti-semitism and help instill a sense of justice and tolerance in the younger students .
and that , they think , ca n't start early enough . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates future funding of fight against extremism federal funding for a multitude of programs to fight right-wing extremism in germany is coming up for review .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2006 youth teaching tolerance to youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are proving effective in spreading the anti-racist message to other youth in germany , not only neo-nazis are behind anti-semitic attacks , young radical islamists are often also to blame .
one project is trying to do something about it by using young people to fight racism among the young . the final bell has rung at the walter gropius school in the berlin district of neukölln and most students are outside playing soccer or eating ice cream .
but four young women , yasmina , ezgi , sarah and tugba , have chosen to stay in a stifling classroom for the afternoon where they 're leafing through history books and talking about what they find there . on a chalkboard , someone has written extremist right-wing slogans such as " the holocaust never happened " that the women have crossed out .
next to the offending statements they 've written facts about the persecution of the jews and put up photographs of holocaust victims and concentration camps . it 's all part of the training the four have been undergoing for a year now to become youth leaders . young mediators increasingly , teachers have watched anti-semitic attitudes develop among immigrant children who are connected with the conflict in the middle east .
to counter this tendency , youth leaders are being trained to act as conflict-resolution mediators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitism is not just a problem of europe 's past a small group of students are being given two years of training so that they can share their knowledge about anti-semitism with their peers .
this anglo-american concept is based on the fact that young people have more credibility when communicating with their own peer group than teachers or other adults do . yasmina , a 17-year-old german-algerian , has been a youth leader from the program 's beginning and in the course of her training , has come to see anti-semitism as a form of racism .
in her view , if neo-nazis use negative words to refer to jews one day , soon they will use epithets to talk about turks . " we want to do something about that , " she said .
the youth leaders ' strategy is not to just yell back , but to use factual arguments to counter their outbursts and untruths . " we basically want to expose their stupidity , " she said . religion as a bridge youth leader is a nationwide project , which has its origins in five schools around berlin and potsdam .
isabell enzenbach is one of the project 's heads who focuses particularly on muslim students , such as those at the walter gropius school .
religion has proven itself to be a " good bridge " between the two cultures , she said . " take eating kosher , for example .
muslims have similar dietary requirements even though they call it halal , " she said .
" it 's the same with clothing customs and religious services .
muslim youth are able to easily understand that from the very beginning . " all the four young women in this training course wear fashionable shirts , low-slung pants and colorful shoes .
they don headscarves only in the mosque or when they want a fashionable accessory .
at the same time , they describe themselves as religious and as being closely connected with islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have also been attacked in germany because of their religion because they know how it feels to be attacked because of their religion , they are also more sensitive to anti-semitic language , which is apparently fairly widespread among people in their age group .
it often takes the form of anti-semitic jokes in the schoolyard or on the bus . youth leaders learn facts about the holocaust and receive training in logical reasoning and role play .
they visit jewish community centers and talk with holocaust survivors and jewish youth of their own age . parental support most parents are supportive of their daughters ' engagement , even though at the beginning there was some skepticism , for example , from ezgi 's mother . " she did n't like it so much that i was participating in the program , " ezgi said .
" she had made anti-semitic comments herself before and blamed the jews for the conflict in the middle east . " but ezgi was able to use reason and facts to convince of her mother otherwise , and to see the conflict from another perspective .
now her mother is more sensitive when it comes to such comments . in a few weeks , ezgi and yasmina are going to become trainers themselves , since they 've organized a project at their school for students in lower grades .
they want to pass on their arguments against anti-semitism and help instill a sense of justice and tolerance in the younger students .
and that , they think , ca n't start early enough . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates future funding of fight against extremism federal funding for a multitude of programs to fight right-wing extremism in germany is coming up for review .

west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "

but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .

they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .

it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .

i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .

most backed keeping the art in place as a reminder of germany darkest past . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . the whole stadium was build in that time - that would mean tear down the whole stadium ?
by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .

most backed keeping the art in place as a reminder of germany darkest past . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . the whole stadium was build in that time - that would mean tear down the whole stadium ?
by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .

but four young women , yasmina , ezgi , sarah and tugba , have chosen to stay in a stifling classroom for the afternoon where they 're leafing through history books and talking about what they find there . on a chalkboard , someone has written extremist right-wing slogans such as " the holocaust never happened " that the women have crossed out .
next to the offending statements they 've written facts about the persecution of the jews and put up photographs of holocaust victims and concentration camps . it 's all part of the training the four have been undergoing for a year now to become youth leaders . young mediators increasingly , teachers have watched anti-semitic attitudes develop among immigrant children who are connected with the conflict in the middle east .
to counter this tendency , youth leaders are being trained to act as conflict-resolution mediators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitism is not just a problem of europe 's past a small group of students are being given two years of training so that they can share their knowledge about anti-semitism with their peers .
this anglo-american concept is based on the fact that young people have more credibility when communicating with their own peer group than teachers or other adults do . yasmina , a 17-year-old german-algerian , has been a youth leader from the program 's beginning and in the course of her training , has come to see anti-semitism as a form of racism .

now her mother is more sensitive when it comes to such comments . in a few weeks , ezgi and yasmina are going to become trainers themselves , since they 've organized a project at their school for students in lower grades .

bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who delivered the cross for ballack 's header , then made it 2-0 after 37 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger , ballack , frings and podolski celebrated on friday schweinsteiger produced a fierce free-kick from 30 yards that thundered past goalkeeper oscar cordoba into the back of the net . it was a second goal in four days for schweinsteiger who scored the equalizer in the 2-2 draw with japan on tuesday . the german league 's top-scorer miroslav klose and his polish-born striking team-mate lukas podolski should both have added to the goals tally in the first half but lacked composure at the decisive moment . the second half was more of the same but colombia finally had a noteworthy attack on the hour mark but elkin soto headed over the crossbar .
in the 68th minute substitute tim borowski , only on the pitch seven minutes , was afforded too much space in the penalty area and finished with aplomb . kli n sma n n has n o regrets " i was delighted that the team got some confidence before the tournament , " klinsmann said .
" it was good to finish with a win and we are now very hungry for the opening game against costa rica -lrb- on june 9 -rrb- .
the fans , the players and myself all just want the tournament to start . " since taking charge in august 2004 klinsmann has raised a few eyebrows with his attacking tactics - often at the expense of defense - but the coach said he has no regrets . " we have had some up and downs but we knew the deadline was next friday in munich , " he said .
" we believe in this team .
i knew when i took over the job that i could not please everyone .
my goal was to build a good team . " in the past germany have perhaps not been known as an attacking team but now they are reminiscent of a kevin keegan team that adopts the policy of outscoring opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things did n't look so great in italy in march however in march italy thumped germany 4-1 in florence to expose their defensive shortcomings and japan showed them up again in tuesday 's 2-2 friendly draw in leverkusen . " we will not alter our philosophy at the world cup , " klinsmann said .

most backed keeping the art in place as a reminder of germany darkest past . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . the whole stadium was build in that time - that would mean tear down the whole stadium ?
by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .
they do not bear a swastika or any other nationalistic emblems .
to remove and / or destroy them would emanate the nazis ' book burning . - ola f he n n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's colosseum should the coliseum in rome be torn down because thousands upon thousands of christians were persecuted and massacred there in the most hideous of ways ?
i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .
perplexed i asked him how come that he surrounds him with these kinds of objects .
he said : " but i survived and they are dead . "
his parents fled with him from the island of rhodes shortly before the whole jewish population of rhodes was imprisoned and killed . - b ert schroer the very fact that these statues have remained in public view is just another testament to german ambivalence regarding their past .
i say leave the sculptures there , illustrating to the world the persistent insincerity germany continues to exhibit for their prior heinous activities . - kurt brick n er bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddha statue that was later destroyed by afghanistan 's taliban regime art of whatever origins should be respected and understood for what it is : a reflection of a period in time - whether is a good or a bad period .
the taliban blew up the mountain buddahs .
it was a horrible thing to do .
art should be viewed with respect , no matter how different our religious or political views .
intolerance was the base for conflict .
what can make free nations different from the nazis and other fanatic group is precisely : tolerance . - g. m. rodriguez compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . the whole stadium was build in that time - that would mean tear down the whole stadium ?
by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .
they do not bear a swastika or any other nationalistic emblems .
to remove and / or destroy them would emanate the nazis ' book burning . - ola f he n n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's colosseum should the coliseum in rome be torn down because thousands upon thousands of christians were persecuted and massacred there in the most hideous of ways ?
i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .
perplexed i asked him how come that he surrounds him with these kinds of objects .
he said : " but i survived and they are dead . "
his parents fled with him from the island of rhodes shortly before the whole jewish population of rhodes was imprisoned and killed . - b ert schroer the very fact that these statues have remained in public view is just another testament to german ambivalence regarding their past .
i say leave the sculptures there , illustrating to the world the persistent insincerity germany continues to exhibit for their prior heinous activities . - kurt brick n er bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddha statue that was later destroyed by afghanistan 's taliban regime art of whatever origins should be respected and understood for what it is : a reflection of a period in time - whether is a good or a bad period .
the taliban blew up the mountain buddahs .
it was a horrible thing to do .
art should be viewed with respect , no matter how different our religious or political views .
intolerance was the base for conflict .
what can make free nations different from the nazis and other fanatic group is precisely : tolerance . - g. m. rodriguez compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

the state of thuringia is the nerve center of sophisticated and innovative optical technology . former communist east germany may today be associated with renovated prefabricated housing blocks and empty city centers .
but the city of jena in the eastern german state of thuringia effortlessly defies that image . the place is a hive of activity these days .

one of the most innovative companies is jenoptik which focuses on six areas of expertise .
according to jenoptik 's norbert thiel , lasers and particularly diode lasers are an important focus of attention and will continue to be so in the future . " it 's very clear the laser processing material markets will be one of our main investments in the future .
a huge market which is coming up is the laser soldering and laser welding , " said thiel . " and the second point of diode lasers is the medicine market .
for example , hair removal is a huge market for laser diodes . " aerospace and back to earth another area that jenoptik is increasingly trying to gain a foothold in is aerospace . the famous multi-spectral camera was developed in jena for the russian mir space project .
norbert thiel points out that today jenoptik is very active in a current aerospace project called rapid eye . " we analyze with this camera from space the chlorophyll content of the earth so we can make direct earth observations , " thiel pointed out .
" we are a market leader in the field of sensor technology .
we are n't intending to assemble and design satellites but we are very much focused on this technology in the future .

so there will be no film to replace and a speeding motorist wo n't even know he 's been caught . " we have a lot of expertise here .
if you measure a distance five times in very short pulses you get the velocity , you get the speed of a car .
we developed a speed measurement system based on lasers . so digital camera , the future will be an infrared flash . " cures for cancer and multiple sclerosis jena is also home to a range of top-notch research institutes such as the institute for physical high technology which performs research and development projects in the areas of magnetics , quantum electronics , micro-systems and laser technology . a further top address for cutting-edge research is the renowned beutenberg campus in jena .
it includes several research institutes which link the fields of physics and optics to new applications in the life sciences . wacker biotech is a prominent example .
its core focus is in the manufacture of so-called biologics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new class of molecules is hoped to find cures for cancers " these are active ingredients for pharmaceuticals .
this is a new class of molecules which developed during the last , i would say , 30 years and what we normally know is so called small molecules , " explained wacker 's anke suter .
" they 're used in the treatment of cancers , multiple sclerosis and because they are proteins they can act in a way that synthesized molecules ca n't currently .
this is a new market and it is strongly growing with an average growth rate of 16 per cent , " suter added . " software is the key driver " another big name on the jena research landscape is carl zeiss , which was founded in 1846 as a workshop for precision mechanics and optics in jena and quickly gained a worldwide reputation for the high quality of its products . " i think innovation is the key of what our business is all about , " said ulrich simon , president and chief executive of carl zeiss micro imaging in jena .
" innovation is the core driver .
we generate a lot of patents , roughly two patents a day over the entire organization , " he added . it 's obvious that the future for carl zeiss lies in automation and miniaturization . " to really turn data in information knowledge - i think that will be the key driver for the future business , " said simon .
" software is one of the key drivers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2006 youth teaching tolerance to youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are proving effective in spreading the anti-racist message to other youth in germany , not only neo-nazis are behind anti-semitic attacks , young radical islamists are often also to blame .
one project is trying to do something about it by using young people to fight racism among the young . the final bell has rung at the walter gropius school in the berlin district of neukölln and most students are outside playing soccer or eating ice cream .
but four young women , yasmina , ezgi , sarah and tugba , have chosen to stay in a stifling classroom for the afternoon where they 're leafing through history books and talking about what they find there . on a chalkboard , someone has written extremist right-wing slogans such as " the holocaust never happened " that the women have crossed out .
next to the offending statements they 've written facts about the persecution of the jews and put up photographs of holocaust victims and concentration camps . it 's all part of the training the four have been undergoing for a year now to become youth leaders . young mediators increasingly , teachers have watched anti-semitic attitudes develop among immigrant children who are connected with the conflict in the middle east .
to counter this tendency , youth leaders are being trained to act as conflict-resolution mediators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitism is not just a problem of europe 's past a small group of students are being given two years of training so that they can share their knowledge about anti-semitism with their peers .
this anglo-american concept is based on the fact that young people have more credibility when communicating with their own peer group than teachers or other adults do . yasmina , a 17-year-old german-algerian , has been a youth leader from the program 's beginning and in the course of her training , has come to see anti-semitism as a form of racism .
in her view , if neo-nazis use negative words to refer to jews one day , soon they will use epithets to talk about turks . " we want to do something about that , " she said .
the youth leaders ' strategy is not to just yell back , but to use factual arguments to counter their outbursts and untruths . " we basically want to expose their stupidity , " she said . religion as a bridge youth leader is a nationwide project , which has its origins in five schools around berlin and potsdam .
isabell enzenbach is one of the project 's heads who focuses particularly on muslim students , such as those at the walter gropius school .
religion has proven itself to be a " good bridge " between the two cultures , she said . " take eating kosher , for example .
muslims have similar dietary requirements even though they call it halal , " she said .
" it 's the same with clothing customs and religious services .
muslim youth are able to easily understand that from the very beginning . " all the four young women in this training course wear fashionable shirts , low-slung pants and colorful shoes .

one project is trying to do something about it by using young people to fight racism among the young . the final bell has rung at the walter gropius school in the berlin district of neukölln and most students are outside playing soccer or eating ice cream .
but four young women , yasmina , ezgi , sarah and tugba , have chosen to stay in a stifling classroom for the afternoon where they 're leafing through history books and talking about what they find there . on a chalkboard , someone has written extremist right-wing slogans such as " the holocaust never happened " that the women have crossed out .
next to the offending statements they 've written facts about the persecution of the jews and put up photographs of holocaust victims and concentration camps . it 's all part of the training the four have been undergoing for a year now to become youth leaders . young mediators increasingly , teachers have watched anti-semitic attitudes develop among immigrant children who are connected with the conflict in the middle east .

this anglo-american concept is based on the fact that young people have more credibility when communicating with their own peer group than teachers or other adults do . yasmina , a 17-year-old german-algerian , has been a youth leader from the program 's beginning and in the course of her training , has come to see anti-semitism as a form of racism .
in her view , if neo-nazis use negative words to refer to jews one day , soon they will use epithets to talk about turks . " we want to do something about that , " she said .
the youth leaders ' strategy is not to just yell back , but to use factual arguments to counter their outbursts and untruths . " we basically want to expose their stupidity , " she said . religion as a bridge youth leader is a nationwide project , which has its origins in five schools around berlin and potsdam .

one project is trying to do something about it by using young people to fight racism among the young . the final bell has rung at the walter gropius school in the berlin district of neukölln and most students are outside playing soccer or eating ice cream .
but four young women , yasmina , ezgi , sarah and tugba , have chosen to stay in a stifling classroom for the afternoon where they 're leafing through history books and talking about what they find there . on a chalkboard , someone has written extremist right-wing slogans such as " the holocaust never happened " that the women have crossed out .
next to the offending statements they 've written facts about the persecution of the jews and put up photographs of holocaust victims and concentration camps . it 's all part of the training the four have been undergoing for a year now to become youth leaders . young mediators increasingly , teachers have watched anti-semitic attitudes develop among immigrant children who are connected with the conflict in the middle east .
to counter this tendency , youth leaders are being trained to act as conflict-resolution mediators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitism is not just a problem of europe 's past a small group of students are being given two years of training so that they can share their knowledge about anti-semitism with their peers .
this anglo-american concept is based on the fact that young people have more credibility when communicating with their own peer group than teachers or other adults do . yasmina , a 17-year-old german-algerian , has been a youth leader from the program 's beginning and in the course of her training , has come to see anti-semitism as a form of racism .
in her view , if neo-nazis use negative words to refer to jews one day , soon they will use epithets to talk about turks . " we want to do something about that , " she said .
the youth leaders ' strategy is not to just yell back , but to use factual arguments to counter their outbursts and untruths . " we basically want to expose their stupidity , " she said . religion as a bridge youth leader is a nationwide project , which has its origins in five schools around berlin and potsdam .
isabell enzenbach is one of the project 's heads who focuses particularly on muslim students , such as those at the walter gropius school .
religion has proven itself to be a " good bridge " between the two cultures , she said . " take eating kosher , for example .
muslims have similar dietary requirements even though they call it halal , " she said .
" it 's the same with clothing customs and religious services .
muslim youth are able to easily understand that from the very beginning . " all the four young women in this training course wear fashionable shirts , low-slung pants and colorful shoes .
they don headscarves only in the mosque or when they want a fashionable accessory .
at the same time , they describe themselves as religious and as being closely connected with islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have also been attacked in germany because of their religion because they know how it feels to be attacked because of their religion , they are also more sensitive to anti-semitic language , which is apparently fairly widespread among people in their age group .
it often takes the form of anti-semitic jokes in the schoolyard or on the bus . youth leaders learn facts about the holocaust and receive training in logical reasoning and role play .
they visit jewish community centers and talk with holocaust survivors and jewish youth of their own age . parental support most parents are supportive of their daughters ' engagement , even though at the beginning there was some skepticism , for example , from ezgi 's mother . " she did n't like it so much that i was participating in the program , " ezgi said .
" she had made anti-semitic comments herself before and blamed the jews for the conflict in the middle east . " but ezgi was able to use reason and facts to convince of her mother otherwise , and to see the conflict from another perspective .
now her mother is more sensitive when it comes to such comments . in a few weeks , ezgi and yasmina are going to become trainers themselves , since they 've organized a project at their school for students in lower grades .
they want to pass on their arguments against anti-semitism and help instill a sense of justice and tolerance in the younger students .
and that , they think , ca n't start early enough . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates future funding of fight against extremism federal funding for a multitude of programs to fight right-wing extremism in germany is coming up for review .

i n 1990 , schäuble was paralyzed after he was shot by a n assassi n . dw-tv : as germa n y 's i n terior mi n ister you are also i n charge of sport policy .
how far do you thi n k germa n y will go i n the soccer world cup ? schäuble : i 'm not only the sports minister ; i 'm also an enthusiastic soccer fan .
and a real fan always hopes his team will win . germa n y hosted the world cup fi n als o n ce before , 32 years ago .
west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "
some politicia n s , some orga n izatio n s , also some embassies , are war n i n g fa n s with a clear n o n -europea n backgrou n d , n ot to go i n to certai n areas , particularly i n easter n germa n y , sayi n g it 's too da n gerous for them there , that too ma n y pote n tially viole n t right-wi n g extremists live there .
are there " n o-go-areas " for foreig n ers i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants germans to stand up against neo-nazis there must n't be .
but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .
and i believe it will change . right-wi n g extremists have a n n ou n ced they wa n t to stir up trouble at the world cup - for example at the game betwee n ira n a n d a n gola i n leipzig . are you i n te n di n g to ba n n eo-nazi demo n stratio n s outside the stadiums ? of course , but the federal states are responsible for this , rather than me .
they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .
if he should decide to come a n d watch his team play here i n germa n y , would he be welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of iran 's national soccer team it is clear that we will adhere to international law , that we will fulfill the guarantees we gave to fifa when we applied to host the world cup .
it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .
but i do say i 'm hopeful , they could get up there .
and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .
actually that 's all 31 other teams .
the key thing would be us winning .
and if we do n't , it will still be a great world cup , that 's clear . christian f. trippe interviewed wolfgang schäuble send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security risks reassessed as us world cup team arrives the arrival of the us team to take up their heavily-guarded headquarters in a central hotel in hamburg was an early test for the world cup 's security arrangements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 03.06.2006 should nazi era sculptures stay at berlin 's olympic stadium ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl albiker 's statues at the stadium many dw-world.de readers commented on the controversy surrounding nazi era sculptures that can still be seen at berlin 's olympic stadium .
most backed keeping the art in place as a reminder of germany darkest past . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . the whole stadium was build in that time - that would mean tear down the whole stadium ?
by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .
they do not bear a swastika or any other nationalistic emblems .
to remove and / or destroy them would emanate the nazis ' book burning . - ola f he n n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's colosseum should the coliseum in rome be torn down because thousands upon thousands of christians were persecuted and massacred there in the most hideous of ways ?
i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .
perplexed i asked him how come that he surrounds him with these kinds of objects .
he said : " but i survived and they are dead . "
his parents fled with him from the island of rhodes shortly before the whole jewish population of rhodes was imprisoned and killed . - b ert schroer the very fact that these statues have remained in public view is just another testament to german ambivalence regarding their past .
i say leave the sculptures there , illustrating to the world the persistent insincerity germany continues to exhibit for their prior heinous activities . - kurt brick n er bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddha statue that was later destroyed by afghanistan 's taliban regime art of whatever origins should be respected and understood for what it is : a reflection of a period in time - whether is a good or a bad period .
the taliban blew up the mountain buddahs .
it was a horrible thing to do .

most backed keeping the art in place as a reminder of germany darkest past . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . the whole stadium was build in that time - that would mean tear down the whole stadium ?
by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .
they do not bear a swastika or any other nationalistic emblems .
to remove and / or destroy them would emanate the nazis ' book burning . - ola f he n n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's colosseum should the coliseum in rome be torn down because thousands upon thousands of christians were persecuted and massacred there in the most hideous of ways ?
i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .
perplexed i asked him how come that he surrounds him with these kinds of objects .
he said : " but i survived and they are dead . "
his parents fled with him from the island of rhodes shortly before the whole jewish population of rhodes was imprisoned and killed . - b ert schroer the very fact that these statues have remained in public view is just another testament to german ambivalence regarding their past .
i say leave the sculptures there , illustrating to the world the persistent insincerity germany continues to exhibit for their prior heinous activities . - kurt brick n er bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddha statue that was later destroyed by afghanistan 's taliban regime art of whatever origins should be respected and understood for what it is : a reflection of a period in time - whether is a good or a bad period .
the taliban blew up the mountain buddahs .
it was a horrible thing to do .
art should be viewed with respect , no matter how different our religious or political views .
intolerance was the base for conflict .
what can make free nations different from the nazis and other fanatic group is precisely : tolerance . - g. m. rodriguez compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

i n 1990 , schäuble was paralyzed after he was shot by a n assassi n . dw-tv : as germa n y 's i n terior mi n ister you are also i n charge of sport policy .
how far do you thi n k germa n y will go i n the soccer world cup ? schäuble : i 'm not only the sports minister ; i 'm also an enthusiastic soccer fan .
and a real fan always hopes his team will win . germa n y hosted the world cup fi n als o n ce before , 32 years ago .
west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "
some politicia n s , some orga n izatio n s , also some embassies , are war n i n g fa n s with a clear n o n -europea n backgrou n d , n ot to go i n to certai n areas , particularly i n easter n germa n y , sayi n g it 's too da n gerous for them there , that too ma n y pote n tially viole n t right-wi n g extremists live there .
are there " n o-go-areas " for foreig n ers i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants germans to stand up against neo-nazis there must n't be .
but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .
and i believe it will change . right-wi n g extremists have a n n ou n ced they wa n t to stir up trouble at the world cup - for example at the game betwee n ira n a n d a n gola i n leipzig . are you i n te n di n g to ba n n eo-nazi demo n stratio n s outside the stadiums ? of course , but the federal states are responsible for this , rather than me .
they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .
if he should decide to come a n d watch his team play here i n germa n y , would he be welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of iran 's national soccer team it is clear that we will adhere to international law , that we will fulfill the guarantees we gave to fifa when we applied to host the world cup .
it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .
but i do say i 'm hopeful , they could get up there .
and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .
actually that 's all 31 other teams .
the key thing would be us winning .

i n 1990 , schäuble was paralyzed after he was shot by a n assassi n . dw-tv : as germa n y 's i n terior mi n ister you are also i n charge of sport policy .
how far do you thi n k germa n y will go i n the soccer world cup ? schäuble : i 'm not only the sports minister ; i 'm also an enthusiastic soccer fan .
and a real fan always hopes his team will win . germa n y hosted the world cup fi n als o n ce before , 32 years ago .
west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "
some politicia n s , some orga n izatio n s , also some embassies , are war n i n g fa n s with a clear n o n -europea n backgrou n d , n ot to go i n to certai n areas , particularly i n easter n germa n y , sayi n g it 's too da n gerous for them there , that too ma n y pote n tially viole n t right-wi n g extremists live there .
are there " n o-go-areas " for foreig n ers i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants germans to stand up against neo-nazis there must n't be .
but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .
and i believe it will change . right-wi n g extremists have a n n ou n ced they wa n t to stir up trouble at the world cup - for example at the game betwee n ira n a n d a n gola i n leipzig . are you i n te n di n g to ba n n eo-nazi demo n stratio n s outside the stadiums ? of course , but the federal states are responsible for this , rather than me .
they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .
if he should decide to come a n d watch his team play here i n germa n y , would he be welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of iran 's national soccer team it is clear that we will adhere to international law , that we will fulfill the guarantees we gave to fifa when we applied to host the world cup .
it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .
but i do say i 'm hopeful , they could get up there .
and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .
actually that 's all 31 other teams .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . the whole stadium was build in that time - that would mean tear down the whole stadium ?
by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .
they do not bear a swastika or any other nationalistic emblems .
to remove and / or destroy them would emanate the nazis ' book burning . - ola f he n n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's colosseum should the coliseum in rome be torn down because thousands upon thousands of christians were persecuted and massacred there in the most hideous of ways ?
i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .
perplexed i asked him how come that he surrounds him with these kinds of objects .
he said : " but i survived and they are dead . "
his parents fled with him from the island of rhodes shortly before the whole jewish population of rhodes was imprisoned and killed . - b ert schroer the very fact that these statues have remained in public view is just another testament to german ambivalence regarding their past .
i say leave the sculptures there , illustrating to the world the persistent insincerity germany continues to exhibit for their prior heinous activities . - kurt brick n er bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddha statue that was later destroyed by afghanistan 's taliban regime art of whatever origins should be respected and understood for what it is : a reflection of a period in time - whether is a good or a bad period .
the taliban blew up the mountain buddahs .
it was a horrible thing to do .
art should be viewed with respect , no matter how different our religious or political views .
intolerance was the base for conflict .
what can make free nations different from the nazis and other fanatic group is precisely : tolerance . - g. m. rodriguez compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .

i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .

no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .
perplexed i asked him how come that he surrounds him with these kinds of objects .
he said : " but i survived and they are dead . "

i n 1990 , schäuble was paralyzed after he was shot by a n assassi n . dw-tv : as germa n y 's i n terior mi n ister you are also i n charge of sport policy .
how far do you thi n k germa n y will go i n the soccer world cup ? schäuble : i 'm not only the sports minister ; i 'm also an enthusiastic soccer fan .
and a real fan always hopes his team will win . germa n y hosted the world cup fi n als o n ce before , 32 years ago .
west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "
some politicia n s , some orga n izatio n s , also some embassies , are war n i n g fa n s with a clear n o n -europea n backgrou n d , n ot to go i n to certai n areas , particularly i n easter n germa n y , sayi n g it 's too da n gerous for them there , that too ma n y pote n tially viole n t right-wi n g extremists live there .
are there " n o-go-areas " for foreig n ers i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants germans to stand up against neo-nazis there must n't be .
but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .
and i believe it will change . right-wi n g extremists have a n n ou n ced they wa n t to stir up trouble at the world cup - for example at the game betwee n ira n a n d a n gola i n leipzig . are you i n te n di n g to ba n n eo-nazi demo n stratio n s outside the stadiums ? of course , but the federal states are responsible for this , rather than me .
they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .
if he should decide to come a n d watch his team play here i n germa n y , would he be welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of iran 's national soccer team it is clear that we will adhere to international law , that we will fulfill the guarantees we gave to fifa when we applied to host the world cup .
it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .
but i do say i 'm hopeful , they could get up there .
and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .

i n 1990 , schäuble was paralyzed after he was shot by a n assassi n . dw-tv : as germa n y 's i n terior mi n ister you are also i n charge of sport policy .
how far do you thi n k germa n y will go i n the soccer world cup ? schäuble : i 'm not only the sports minister ; i 'm also an enthusiastic soccer fan .
and a real fan always hopes his team will win . germa n y hosted the world cup fi n als o n ce before , 32 years ago .
west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "
some politicia n s , some orga n izatio n s , also some embassies , are war n i n g fa n s with a clear n o n -europea n backgrou n d , n ot to go i n to certai n areas , particularly i n easter n germa n y , sayi n g it 's too da n gerous for them there , that too ma n y pote n tially viole n t right-wi n g extremists live there .
are there " n o-go-areas " for foreig n ers i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants germans to stand up against neo-nazis there must n't be .
but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .
and i believe it will change . right-wi n g extremists have a n n ou n ced they wa n t to stir up trouble at the world cup - for example at the game betwee n ira n a n d a n gola i n leipzig . are you i n te n di n g to ba n n eo-nazi demo n stratio n s outside the stadiums ? of course , but the federal states are responsible for this , rather than me .
they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .
if he should decide to come a n d watch his team play here i n germa n y , would he be welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of iran 's national soccer team it is clear that we will adhere to international law , that we will fulfill the guarantees we gave to fifa when we applied to host the world cup .
it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .
but i do say i 'm hopeful , they could get up there .
and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .
actually that 's all 31 other teams .
the key thing would be us winning .
and if we do n't , it will still be a great world cup , that 's clear . christian f. trippe interviewed wolfgang schäuble send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security risks reassessed as us world cup team arrives the arrival of the us team to take up their heavily-guarded headquarters in a central hotel in hamburg was an early test for the world cup 's security arrangements .

i n 1990 , schäuble was paralyzed after he was shot by a n assassi n . dw-tv : as germa n y 's i n terior mi n ister you are also i n charge of sport policy .
how far do you thi n k germa n y will go i n the soccer world cup ? schäuble : i 'm not only the sports minister ; i 'm also an enthusiastic soccer fan .
and a real fan always hopes his team will win . germa n y hosted the world cup fi n als o n ce before , 32 years ago .
west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "
some politicia n s , some orga n izatio n s , also some embassies , are war n i n g fa n s with a clear n o n -europea n backgrou n d , n ot to go i n to certai n areas , particularly i n easter n germa n y , sayi n g it 's too da n gerous for them there , that too ma n y pote n tially viole n t right-wi n g extremists live there .
are there " n o-go-areas " for foreig n ers i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants germans to stand up against neo-nazis there must n't be .
but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .
and i believe it will change . right-wi n g extremists have a n n ou n ced they wa n t to stir up trouble at the world cup - for example at the game betwee n ira n a n d a n gola i n leipzig . are you i n te n di n g to ba n n eo-nazi demo n stratio n s outside the stadiums ? of course , but the federal states are responsible for this , rather than me .
they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .
if he should decide to come a n d watch his team play here i n germa n y , would he be welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of iran 's national soccer team it is clear that we will adhere to international law , that we will fulfill the guarantees we gave to fifa when we applied to host the world cup .
it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .
but i do say i 'm hopeful , they could get up there .
and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .
actually that 's all 31 other teams .
the key thing would be us winning .
and if we do n't , it will still be a great world cup , that 's clear . christian f. trippe interviewed wolfgang schäuble send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security risks reassessed as us world cup team arrives the arrival of the us team to take up their heavily-guarded headquarters in a central hotel in hamburg was an early test for the world cup 's security arrangements .

of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .

our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .

whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .

but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .

i n 1990 , schäuble was paralyzed after he was shot by a n assassi n . dw-tv : as germa n y 's i n terior mi n ister you are also i n charge of sport policy .
how far do you thi n k germa n y will go i n the soccer world cup ? schäuble : i 'm not only the sports minister ; i 'm also an enthusiastic soccer fan .
and a real fan always hopes his team will win . germa n y hosted the world cup fi n als o n ce before , 32 years ago .
west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "
some politicia n s , some orga n izatio n s , also some embassies , are war n i n g fa n s with a clear n o n -europea n backgrou n d , n ot to go i n to certai n areas , particularly i n easter n germa n y , sayi n g it 's too da n gerous for them there , that too ma n y pote n tially viole n t right-wi n g extremists live there .

but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .
and i believe it will change . right-wi n g extremists have a n n ou n ced they wa n t to stir up trouble at the world cup - for example at the game betwee n ira n a n d a n gola i n leipzig . are you i n te n di n g to ba n n eo-nazi demo n stratio n s outside the stadiums ? of course , but the federal states are responsible for this , rather than me .
they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .

it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .

and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 03.06.2006 should nazi era sculptures stay at berlin 's olympic stadium ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl albiker 's statues at the stadium many dw-world.de readers commented on the controversy surrounding nazi era sculptures that can still be seen at berlin 's olympic stadium .
most backed keeping the art in place as a reminder of germany darkest past . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . the whole stadium was build in that time - that would mean tear down the whole stadium ?
by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .
they do not bear a swastika or any other nationalistic emblems .
to remove and / or destroy them would emanate the nazis ' book burning . - ola f he n n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's colosseum should the coliseum in rome be torn down because thousands upon thousands of christians were persecuted and massacred there in the most hideous of ways ?
i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .
perplexed i asked him how come that he surrounds him with these kinds of objects .
he said : " but i survived and they are dead . "
his parents fled with him from the island of rhodes shortly before the whole jewish population of rhodes was imprisoned and killed . - b ert schroer the very fact that these statues have remained in public view is just another testament to german ambivalence regarding their past .
i say leave the sculptures there , illustrating to the world the persistent insincerity germany continues to exhibit for their prior heinous activities . - kurt brick n er bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddha statue that was later destroyed by afghanistan 's taliban regime art of whatever origins should be respected and understood for what it is : a reflection of a period in time - whether is a good or a bad period .
the taliban blew up the mountain buddahs .
it was a horrible thing to do .
art should be viewed with respect , no matter how different our religious or political views .
intolerance was the base for conflict .
what can make free nations different from the nazis and other fanatic group is precisely : tolerance . - g. m. rodriguez compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .
they do not bear a swastika or any other nationalistic emblems .
to remove and / or destroy them would emanate the nazis ' book burning . - ola f he n n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's colosseum should the coliseum in rome be torn down because thousands upon thousands of christians were persecuted and massacred there in the most hideous of ways ?
i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .
perplexed i asked him how come that he surrounds him with these kinds of objects .
he said : " but i survived and they are dead . "
his parents fled with him from the island of rhodes shortly before the whole jewish population of rhodes was imprisoned and killed . - b ert schroer the very fact that these statues have remained in public view is just another testament to german ambivalence regarding their past .
i say leave the sculptures there , illustrating to the world the persistent insincerity germany continues to exhibit for their prior heinous activities . - kurt brick n er bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddha statue that was later destroyed by afghanistan 's taliban regime art of whatever origins should be respected and understood for what it is : a reflection of a period in time - whether is a good or a bad period .
the taliban blew up the mountain buddahs .
it was a horrible thing to do .
art should be viewed with respect , no matter how different our religious or political views .
intolerance was the base for conflict .
what can make free nations different from the nazis and other fanatic group is precisely : tolerance . - g. m. rodriguez compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .
they do not bear a swastika or any other nationalistic emblems .
to remove and / or destroy them would emanate the nazis ' book burning . - ola f he n n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's colosseum should the coliseum in rome be torn down because thousands upon thousands of christians were persecuted and massacred there in the most hideous of ways ?
i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .
perplexed i asked him how come that he surrounds him with these kinds of objects .
he said : " but i survived and they are dead . "
his parents fled with him from the island of rhodes shortly before the whole jewish population of rhodes was imprisoned and killed . - b ert schroer the very fact that these statues have remained in public view is just another testament to german ambivalence regarding their past .
i say leave the sculptures there , illustrating to the world the persistent insincerity germany continues to exhibit for their prior heinous activities . - kurt brick n er bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddha statue that was later destroyed by afghanistan 's taliban regime art of whatever origins should be respected and understood for what it is : a reflection of a period in time - whether is a good or a bad period .
the taliban blew up the mountain buddahs .
it was a horrible thing to do .
art should be viewed with respect , no matter how different our religious or political views .
intolerance was the base for conflict .
what can make free nations different from the nazis and other fanatic group is precisely : tolerance . - g. m. rodriguez compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who delivered the cross for ballack 's header , then made it 2-0 after 37 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger , ballack , frings and podolski celebrated on friday schweinsteiger produced a fierce free-kick from 30 yards that thundered past goalkeeper oscar cordoba into the back of the net . it was a second goal in four days for schweinsteiger who scored the equalizer in the 2-2 draw with japan on tuesday . the german league 's top-scorer miroslav klose and his polish-born striking team-mate lukas podolski should both have added to the goals tally in the first half but lacked composure at the decisive moment . the second half was more of the same but colombia finally had a noteworthy attack on the hour mark but elkin soto headed over the crossbar .
in the 68th minute substitute tim borowski , only on the pitch seven minutes , was afforded too much space in the penalty area and finished with aplomb . kli n sma n n has n o regrets " i was delighted that the team got some confidence before the tournament , " klinsmann said .
" it was good to finish with a win and we are now very hungry for the opening game against costa rica -lrb- on june 9 -rrb- .
the fans , the players and myself all just want the tournament to start . " since taking charge in august 2004 klinsmann has raised a few eyebrows with his attacking tactics - often at the expense of defense - but the coach said he has no regrets . " we have had some up and downs but we knew the deadline was next friday in munich , " he said .
" we believe in this team .
i knew when i took over the job that i could not please everyone .
my goal was to build a good team . " in the past germany have perhaps not been known as an attacking team but now they are reminiscent of a kevin keegan team that adopts the policy of outscoring opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things did n't look so great in italy in march however in march italy thumped germany 4-1 in florence to expose their defensive shortcomings and japan showed them up again in tuesday 's 2-2 friendly draw in leverkusen . " we will not alter our philosophy at the world cup , " klinsmann said .
" we want to get forward quickly and offer attractive soccer to the public .
it is wrong to say we have problems in defense .
we just have a problem switching off when we lose the ball .

the state of thuringia is the nerve center of sophisticated and innovative optical technology . former communist east germany may today be associated with renovated prefabricated housing blocks and empty city centers .
but the city of jena in the eastern german state of thuringia effortlessly defies that image . the place is a hive of activity these days .
not only is it a major center for the optics industry there is also a technology and innovations park with around 60 firms and several research centers on the campus of the university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of jenoptik with diode lasers .
one of the most innovative companies is jenoptik which focuses on six areas of expertise .
according to jenoptik 's norbert thiel , lasers and particularly diode lasers are an important focus of attention and will continue to be so in the future . " it 's very clear the laser processing material markets will be one of our main investments in the future .
a huge market which is coming up is the laser soldering and laser welding , " said thiel . " and the second point of diode lasers is the medicine market .
for example , hair removal is a huge market for laser diodes . " aerospace and back to earth another area that jenoptik is increasingly trying to gain a foothold in is aerospace . the famous multi-spectral camera was developed in jena for the russian mir space project .
norbert thiel points out that today jenoptik is very active in a current aerospace project called rapid eye . " we analyze with this camera from space the chlorophyll content of the earth so we can make direct earth observations , " thiel pointed out .
" we are a market leader in the field of sensor technology .
we are n't intending to assemble and design satellites but we are very much focused on this technology in the future . " back on earth , life is destined to get difficult for speeding motorists following the work done by jenoptik together with its partner company robot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motorists will have to watch out next time they 're speeding jenoptik has developed a speed measurement system based on lasers .
and , says thiel , the future will be in digital speed cameras .
so there will be no film to replace and a speeding motorist wo n't even know he 's been caught . " we have a lot of expertise here .
if you measure a distance five times in very short pulses you get the velocity , you get the speed of a car .
we developed a speed measurement system based on lasers . so digital camera , the future will be an infrared flash . " cures for cancer and multiple sclerosis jena is also home to a range of top-notch research institutes such as the institute for physical high technology which performs research and development projects in the areas of magnetics , quantum electronics , micro-systems and laser technology . a further top address for cutting-edge research is the renowned beutenberg campus in jena .
it includes several research institutes which link the fields of physics and optics to new applications in the life sciences . wacker biotech is a prominent example .
its core focus is in the manufacture of so-called biologics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new class of molecules is hoped to find cures for cancers " these are active ingredients for pharmaceuticals .
this is a new class of molecules which developed during the last , i would say , 30 years and what we normally know is so called small molecules , " explained wacker 's anke suter .
" they 're used in the treatment of cancers , multiple sclerosis and because they are proteins they can act in a way that synthesized molecules ca n't currently .
this is a new market and it is strongly growing with an average growth rate of 16 per cent , " suter added . " software is the key driver " another big name on the jena research landscape is carl zeiss , which was founded in 1846 as a workshop for precision mechanics and optics in jena and quickly gained a worldwide reputation for the high quality of its products . " i think innovation is the key of what our business is all about , " said ulrich simon , president and chief executive of carl zeiss micro imaging in jena .
" innovation is the core driver .
we generate a lot of patents , roughly two patents a day over the entire organization , " he added . it 's obvious that the future for carl zeiss lies in automation and miniaturization . " to really turn data in information knowledge - i think that will be the key driver for the future business , " said simon .
" software is one of the key drivers .
what you want to do in the end is you just put a sample into the laptop and get out the information , by just hitting one button .
this will be our vision .

in her view , if neo-nazis use negative words to refer to jews one day , soon they will use epithets to talk about turks . " we want to do something about that , " she said .

the state of thuringia is the nerve center of sophisticated and innovative optical technology . former communist east germany may today be associated with renovated prefabricated housing blocks and empty city centers .
but the city of jena in the eastern german state of thuringia effortlessly defies that image . the place is a hive of activity these days .
not only is it a major center for the optics industry there is also a technology and innovations park with around 60 firms and several research centers on the campus of the university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of jenoptik with diode lasers .
one of the most innovative companies is jenoptik which focuses on six areas of expertise .
according to jenoptik 's norbert thiel , lasers and particularly diode lasers are an important focus of attention and will continue to be so in the future . " it 's very clear the laser processing material markets will be one of our main investments in the future .
a huge market which is coming up is the laser soldering and laser welding , " said thiel . " and the second point of diode lasers is the medicine market .
for example , hair removal is a huge market for laser diodes . " aerospace and back to earth another area that jenoptik is increasingly trying to gain a foothold in is aerospace . the famous multi-spectral camera was developed in jena for the russian mir space project .
norbert thiel points out that today jenoptik is very active in a current aerospace project called rapid eye . " we analyze with this camera from space the chlorophyll content of the earth so we can make direct earth observations , " thiel pointed out .
" we are a market leader in the field of sensor technology .
we are n't intending to assemble and design satellites but we are very much focused on this technology in the future . " back on earth , life is destined to get difficult for speeding motorists following the work done by jenoptik together with its partner company robot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motorists will have to watch out next time they 're speeding jenoptik has developed a speed measurement system based on lasers .
and , says thiel , the future will be in digital speed cameras .
so there will be no film to replace and a speeding motorist wo n't even know he 's been caught . " we have a lot of expertise here .
if you measure a distance five times in very short pulses you get the velocity , you get the speed of a car .
we developed a speed measurement system based on lasers . so digital camera , the future will be an infrared flash . " cures for cancer and multiple sclerosis jena is also home to a range of top-notch research institutes such as the institute for physical high technology which performs research and development projects in the areas of magnetics , quantum electronics , micro-systems and laser technology . a further top address for cutting-edge research is the renowned beutenberg campus in jena .
it includes several research institutes which link the fields of physics and optics to new applications in the life sciences . wacker biotech is a prominent example .
its core focus is in the manufacture of so-called biologics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new class of molecules is hoped to find cures for cancers " these are active ingredients for pharmaceuticals .
this is a new class of molecules which developed during the last , i would say , 30 years and what we normally know is so called small molecules , " explained wacker 's anke suter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2006 youth teaching tolerance to youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are proving effective in spreading the anti-racist message to other youth in germany , not only neo-nazis are behind anti-semitic attacks , young radical islamists are often also to blame .
one project is trying to do something about it by using young people to fight racism among the young . the final bell has rung at the walter gropius school in the berlin district of neukölln and most students are outside playing soccer or eating ice cream .
but four young women , yasmina , ezgi , sarah and tugba , have chosen to stay in a stifling classroom for the afternoon where they 're leafing through history books and talking about what they find there . on a chalkboard , someone has written extremist right-wing slogans such as " the holocaust never happened " that the women have crossed out .
next to the offending statements they 've written facts about the persecution of the jews and put up photographs of holocaust victims and concentration camps . it 's all part of the training the four have been undergoing for a year now to become youth leaders . young mediators increasingly , teachers have watched anti-semitic attitudes develop among immigrant children who are connected with the conflict in the middle east .
to counter this tendency , youth leaders are being trained to act as conflict-resolution mediators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitism is not just a problem of europe 's past a small group of students are being given two years of training so that they can share their knowledge about anti-semitism with their peers .
this anglo-american concept is based on the fact that young people have more credibility when communicating with their own peer group than teachers or other adults do . yasmina , a 17-year-old german-algerian , has been a youth leader from the program 's beginning and in the course of her training , has come to see anti-semitism as a form of racism .
in her view , if neo-nazis use negative words to refer to jews one day , soon they will use epithets to talk about turks . " we want to do something about that , " she said .
the youth leaders ' strategy is not to just yell back , but to use factual arguments to counter their outbursts and untruths . " we basically want to expose their stupidity , " she said . religion as a bridge youth leader is a nationwide project , which has its origins in five schools around berlin and potsdam .
isabell enzenbach is one of the project 's heads who focuses particularly on muslim students , such as those at the walter gropius school .
religion has proven itself to be a " good bridge " between the two cultures , she said . " take eating kosher , for example .
muslims have similar dietary requirements even though they call it halal , " she said .
" it 's the same with clothing customs and religious services .
muslim youth are able to easily understand that from the very beginning . " all the four young women in this training course wear fashionable shirts , low-slung pants and colorful shoes .
they don headscarves only in the mosque or when they want a fashionable accessory .
at the same time , they describe themselves as religious and as being closely connected with islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have also been attacked in germany because of their religion because they know how it feels to be attacked because of their religion , they are also more sensitive to anti-semitic language , which is apparently fairly widespread among people in their age group .
it often takes the form of anti-semitic jokes in the schoolyard or on the bus . youth leaders learn facts about the holocaust and receive training in logical reasoning and role play .
they visit jewish community centers and talk with holocaust survivors and jewish youth of their own age . parental support most parents are supportive of their daughters ' engagement , even though at the beginning there was some skepticism , for example , from ezgi 's mother . " she did n't like it so much that i was participating in the program , " ezgi said .
" she had made anti-semitic comments herself before and blamed the jews for the conflict in the middle east . " but ezgi was able to use reason and facts to convince of her mother otherwise , and to see the conflict from another perspective .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.06.2006 youth teaching tolerance to youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young people are proving effective in spreading the anti-racist message to other youth in germany , not only neo-nazis are behind anti-semitic attacks , young radical islamists are often also to blame .
one project is trying to do something about it by using young people to fight racism among the young . the final bell has rung at the walter gropius school in the berlin district of neukölln and most students are outside playing soccer or eating ice cream .
but four young women , yasmina , ezgi , sarah and tugba , have chosen to stay in a stifling classroom for the afternoon where they 're leafing through history books and talking about what they find there . on a chalkboard , someone has written extremist right-wing slogans such as " the holocaust never happened " that the women have crossed out .
next to the offending statements they 've written facts about the persecution of the jews and put up photographs of holocaust victims and concentration camps . it 's all part of the training the four have been undergoing for a year now to become youth leaders . young mediators increasingly , teachers have watched anti-semitic attitudes develop among immigrant children who are connected with the conflict in the middle east .
to counter this tendency , youth leaders are being trained to act as conflict-resolution mediators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-semitism is not just a problem of europe 's past a small group of students are being given two years of training so that they can share their knowledge about anti-semitism with their peers .
this anglo-american concept is based on the fact that young people have more credibility when communicating with their own peer group than teachers or other adults do . yasmina , a 17-year-old german-algerian , has been a youth leader from the program 's beginning and in the course of her training , has come to see anti-semitism as a form of racism .
in her view , if neo-nazis use negative words to refer to jews one day , soon they will use epithets to talk about turks . " we want to do something about that , " she said .
the youth leaders ' strategy is not to just yell back , but to use factual arguments to counter their outbursts and untruths . " we basically want to expose their stupidity , " she said . religion as a bridge youth leader is a nationwide project , which has its origins in five schools around berlin and potsdam .
isabell enzenbach is one of the project 's heads who focuses particularly on muslim students , such as those at the walter gropius school .
religion has proven itself to be a " good bridge " between the two cultures , she said . " take eating kosher , for example .
muslims have similar dietary requirements even though they call it halal , " she said .
" it 's the same with clothing customs and religious services .
muslim youth are able to easily understand that from the very beginning . " all the four young women in this training course wear fashionable shirts , low-slung pants and colorful shoes .
they don headscarves only in the mosque or when they want a fashionable accessory .
at the same time , they describe themselves as religious and as being closely connected with islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have also been attacked in germany because of their religion because they know how it feels to be attacked because of their religion , they are also more sensitive to anti-semitic language , which is apparently fairly widespread among people in their age group .
it often takes the form of anti-semitic jokes in the schoolyard or on the bus . youth leaders learn facts about the holocaust and receive training in logical reasoning and role play .
they visit jewish community centers and talk with holocaust survivors and jewish youth of their own age . parental support most parents are supportive of their daughters ' engagement , even though at the beginning there was some skepticism , for example , from ezgi 's mother . " she did n't like it so much that i was participating in the program , " ezgi said .
" she had made anti-semitic comments herself before and blamed the jews for the conflict in the middle east . " but ezgi was able to use reason and facts to convince of her mother otherwise , and to see the conflict from another perspective .
now her mother is more sensitive when it comes to such comments . in a few weeks , ezgi and yasmina are going to become trainers themselves , since they 've organized a project at their school for students in lower grades .
they want to pass on their arguments against anti-semitism and help instill a sense of justice and tolerance in the younger students .

the state of thuringia is the nerve center of sophisticated and innovative optical technology . former communist east germany may today be associated with renovated prefabricated housing blocks and empty city centers .
but the city of jena in the eastern german state of thuringia effortlessly defies that image . the place is a hive of activity these days .
not only is it a major center for the optics industry there is also a technology and innovations park with around 60 firms and several research centers on the campus of the university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of jenoptik with diode lasers .
one of the most innovative companies is jenoptik which focuses on six areas of expertise .
according to jenoptik 's norbert thiel , lasers and particularly diode lasers are an important focus of attention and will continue to be so in the future . " it 's very clear the laser processing material markets will be one of our main investments in the future .
a huge market which is coming up is the laser soldering and laser welding , " said thiel . " and the second point of diode lasers is the medicine market .
for example , hair removal is a huge market for laser diodes . " aerospace and back to earth another area that jenoptik is increasingly trying to gain a foothold in is aerospace . the famous multi-spectral camera was developed in jena for the russian mir space project .
norbert thiel points out that today jenoptik is very active in a current aerospace project called rapid eye . " we analyze with this camera from space the chlorophyll content of the earth so we can make direct earth observations , " thiel pointed out .
" we are a market leader in the field of sensor technology .
we are n't intending to assemble and design satellites but we are very much focused on this technology in the future .

so there will be no film to replace and a speeding motorist wo n't even know he 's been caught . " we have a lot of expertise here .

" cures for cancer and multiple sclerosis jena is also home to a range of top-notch research institutes such as the institute for physical high technology which performs research and development projects in the areas of magnetics , quantum electronics , micro-systems and laser technology . a further top address for cutting-edge research is the renowned beutenberg campus in jena .
it includes several research institutes which link the fields of physics and optics to new applications in the life sciences . wacker biotech is a prominent example .
its core focus is in the manufacture of so-called biologics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new class of molecules is hoped to find cures for cancers " these are active ingredients for pharmaceuticals .
this is a new class of molecules which developed during the last , i would say , 30 years and what we normally know is so called small molecules , " explained wacker 's anke suter .
" they 're used in the treatment of cancers , multiple sclerosis and because they are proteins they can act in a way that synthesized molecules ca n't currently .
this is a new market and it is strongly growing with an average growth rate of 16 per cent , " suter added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 03.06.2006 should nazi era sculptures stay at berlin 's olympic stadium ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl albiker 's statues at the stadium many dw-world.de readers commented on the controversy surrounding nazi era sculptures that can still be seen at berlin 's olympic stadium .
most backed keeping the art in place as a reminder of germany darkest past . the followi n g comme n ts reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . the whole stadium was build in that time - that would mean tear down the whole stadium ?
by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .
they do not bear a swastika or any other nationalistic emblems .
to remove and / or destroy them would emanate the nazis ' book burning . - ola f he n n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's colosseum should the coliseum in rome be torn down because thousands upon thousands of christians were persecuted and massacred there in the most hideous of ways ?
i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .
perplexed i asked him how come that he surrounds him with these kinds of objects .
he said : " but i survived and they are dead . "
his parents fled with him from the island of rhodes shortly before the whole jewish population of rhodes was imprisoned and killed . - b ert schroer the very fact that these statues have remained in public view is just another testament to german ambivalence regarding their past .
i say leave the sculptures there , illustrating to the world the persistent insincerity germany continues to exhibit for their prior heinous activities . - kurt brick n er bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddha statue that was later destroyed by afghanistan 's taliban regime art of whatever origins should be respected and understood for what it is : a reflection of a period in time - whether is a good or a bad period .
the taliban blew up the mountain buddahs .
it was a horrible thing to do .
art should be viewed with respect , no matter how different our religious or political views .
intolerance was the base for conflict .
what can make free nations different from the nazis and other fanatic group is precisely : tolerance . - g. m. rodriguez compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

the state of thuringia is the nerve center of sophisticated and innovative optical technology . former communist east germany may today be associated with renovated prefabricated housing blocks and empty city centers .
but the city of jena in the eastern german state of thuringia effortlessly defies that image . the place is a hive of activity these days .
not only is it a major center for the optics industry there is also a technology and innovations park with around 60 firms and several research centers on the campus of the university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of jenoptik with diode lasers .
one of the most innovative companies is jenoptik which focuses on six areas of expertise .
according to jenoptik 's norbert thiel , lasers and particularly diode lasers are an important focus of attention and will continue to be so in the future . " it 's very clear the laser processing material markets will be one of our main investments in the future .
a huge market which is coming up is the laser soldering and laser welding , " said thiel . " and the second point of diode lasers is the medicine market .
for example , hair removal is a huge market for laser diodes . " aerospace and back to earth another area that jenoptik is increasingly trying to gain a foothold in is aerospace . the famous multi-spectral camera was developed in jena for the russian mir space project .
norbert thiel points out that today jenoptik is very active in a current aerospace project called rapid eye . " we analyze with this camera from space the chlorophyll content of the earth so we can make direct earth observations , " thiel pointed out .
" we are a market leader in the field of sensor technology .
we are n't intending to assemble and design satellites but we are very much focused on this technology in the future . " back on earth , life is destined to get difficult for speeding motorists following the work done by jenoptik together with its partner company robot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motorists will have to watch out next time they 're speeding jenoptik has developed a speed measurement system based on lasers .
and , says thiel , the future will be in digital speed cameras .
so there will be no film to replace and a speeding motorist wo n't even know he 's been caught . " we have a lot of expertise here .
if you measure a distance five times in very short pulses you get the velocity , you get the speed of a car .
we developed a speed measurement system based on lasers . so digital camera , the future will be an infrared flash . " cures for cancer and multiple sclerosis jena is also home to a range of top-notch research institutes such as the institute for physical high technology which performs research and development projects in the areas of magnetics , quantum electronics , micro-systems and laser technology . a further top address for cutting-edge research is the renowned beutenberg campus in jena .
it includes several research institutes which link the fields of physics and optics to new applications in the life sciences . wacker biotech is a prominent example .
its core focus is in the manufacture of so-called biologics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new class of molecules is hoped to find cures for cancers " these are active ingredients for pharmaceuticals .
this is a new class of molecules which developed during the last , i would say , 30 years and what we normally know is so called small molecules , " explained wacker 's anke suter .
" they 're used in the treatment of cancers , multiple sclerosis and because they are proteins they can act in a way that synthesized molecules ca n't currently .
this is a new market and it is strongly growing with an average growth rate of 16 per cent , " suter added . " software is the key driver " another big name on the jena research landscape is carl zeiss , which was founded in 1846 as a workshop for precision mechanics and optics in jena and quickly gained a worldwide reputation for the high quality of its products . " i think innovation is the key of what our business is all about , " said ulrich simon , president and chief executive of carl zeiss micro imaging in jena .
" innovation is the core driver .
we generate a lot of patents , roughly two patents a day over the entire organization , " he added . it 's obvious that the future for carl zeiss lies in automation and miniaturization . " to really turn data in information knowledge - i think that will be the key driver for the future business , " said simon .
" software is one of the key drivers .
what you want to do in the end is you just put a sample into the laptop and get out the information , by just hitting one button .
this will be our vision .

the state of thuringia is the nerve center of sophisticated and innovative optical technology . former communist east germany may today be associated with renovated prefabricated housing blocks and empty city centers .
but the city of jena in the eastern german state of thuringia effortlessly defies that image . the place is a hive of activity these days .
not only is it a major center for the optics industry there is also a technology and innovations park with around 60 firms and several research centers on the campus of the university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of jenoptik with diode lasers .
one of the most innovative companies is jenoptik which focuses on six areas of expertise .
according to jenoptik 's norbert thiel , lasers and particularly diode lasers are an important focus of attention and will continue to be so in the future . " it 's very clear the laser processing material markets will be one of our main investments in the future .
a huge market which is coming up is the laser soldering and laser welding , " said thiel . " and the second point of diode lasers is the medicine market .
for example , hair removal is a huge market for laser diodes . " aerospace and back to earth another area that jenoptik is increasingly trying to gain a foothold in is aerospace . the famous multi-spectral camera was developed in jena for the russian mir space project .
norbert thiel points out that today jenoptik is very active in a current aerospace project called rapid eye . " we analyze with this camera from space the chlorophyll content of the earth so we can make direct earth observations , " thiel pointed out .
" we are a market leader in the field of sensor technology .
we are n't intending to assemble and design satellites but we are very much focused on this technology in the future . " back on earth , life is destined to get difficult for speeding motorists following the work done by jenoptik together with its partner company robot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motorists will have to watch out next time they 're speeding jenoptik has developed a speed measurement system based on lasers .
and , says thiel , the future will be in digital speed cameras .
so there will be no film to replace and a speeding motorist wo n't even know he 's been caught . " we have a lot of expertise here .
if you measure a distance five times in very short pulses you get the velocity , you get the speed of a car .
we developed a speed measurement system based on lasers . so digital camera , the future will be an infrared flash . " cures for cancer and multiple sclerosis jena is also home to a range of top-notch research institutes such as the institute for physical high technology which performs research and development projects in the areas of magnetics , quantum electronics , micro-systems and laser technology . a further top address for cutting-edge research is the renowned beutenberg campus in jena .
it includes several research institutes which link the fields of physics and optics to new applications in the life sciences . wacker biotech is a prominent example .
its core focus is in the manufacture of so-called biologics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new class of molecules is hoped to find cures for cancers " these are active ingredients for pharmaceuticals .
this is a new class of molecules which developed during the last , i would say , 30 years and what we normally know is so called small molecules , " explained wacker 's anke suter .
" they 're used in the treatment of cancers , multiple sclerosis and because they are proteins they can act in a way that synthesized molecules ca n't currently .
this is a new market and it is strongly growing with an average growth rate of 16 per cent , " suter added . " software is the key driver " another big name on the jena research landscape is carl zeiss , which was founded in 1846 as a workshop for precision mechanics and optics in jena and quickly gained a worldwide reputation for the high quality of its products . " i think innovation is the key of what our business is all about , " said ulrich simon , president and chief executive of carl zeiss micro imaging in jena .
" innovation is the core driver .
we generate a lot of patents , roughly two patents a day over the entire organization , " he added . it 's obvious that the future for carl zeiss lies in automation and miniaturization . " to really turn data in information knowledge - i think that will be the key driver for the future business , " said simon .
" software is one of the key drivers .
what you want to do in the end is you just put a sample into the laptop and get out the information , by just hitting one button .
this will be our vision .

in her view , if neo-nazis use negative words to refer to jews one day , soon they will use epithets to talk about turks . " we want to do something about that , " she said .

i n 1990 , schäuble was paralyzed after he was shot by a n assassi n . dw-tv : as germa n y 's i n terior mi n ister you are also i n charge of sport policy .
how far do you thi n k germa n y will go i n the soccer world cup ? schäuble : i 'm not only the sports minister ; i 'm also an enthusiastic soccer fan .
and a real fan always hopes his team will win . germa n y hosted the world cup fi n als o n ce before , 32 years ago .
west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "
some politicia n s , some orga n izatio n s , also some embassies , are war n i n g fa n s with a clear n o n -europea n backgrou n d , n ot to go i n to certai n areas , particularly i n easter n germa n y , sayi n g it 's too da n gerous for them there , that too ma n y pote n tially viole n t right-wi n g extremists live there .
are there " n o-go-areas " for foreig n ers i n germa n y ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants germans to stand up against neo-nazis there must n't be .
but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .
society as a whole also needs to get involved .
we can not allow a climate of hopelessness to develop .
we ca n't just accept talk that the extreme-right npd has more to offer young men than other organizations .
that 's a disgrace for the rest of us .
that can be changed .
it must be changed .
and i believe it will change . right-wi n g extremists have a n n ou n ced they wa n t to stir up trouble at the world cup - for example at the game betwee n ira n a n d a n gola i n leipzig . are you i n te n di n g to ba n n eo-nazi demo n stratio n s outside the stadiums ? of course , but the federal states are responsible for this , rather than me .
they 've already announced they 'll ban this , and i hope that the courts will support the decision .
there 's always the consideration of the freedom to demonstrate .
but i think criminals and the lunatic fringe should n't be given the opportunity to get all the attention that the world cup will be focusing on germany , with billions of people watching . the ira n ia n team has o n e very problematic fa n , the preside n t of their cou n try , mahmoud ahmadi n ejad , who has publicly made clearly a n ti-semitic stateme n ts .
if he should decide to come a n d watch his team play here i n germa n y , would he be welcome ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of iran 's national soccer team it is clear that we will adhere to international law , that we will fulfill the guarantees we gave to fifa when we applied to host the world cup .
it 's senseless to now debate these abstract issues here in germany .
the statements the iranian president has made -lrb- also in a german news magazine -rrb- - in particular , though not only , about israel , but also about the holocaust - are completely abhorrent and unacceptable , whether or not he comes to the world cup or not . a n d fi n ally : you 're tippi n g germa n y to wi n the cup .
who ' will they face i n the fi n al ? well i must n't go too far out on a limb here .
i did n't say that was my tip .
i said that 's what i 'm hoping , did n't i ?
i 'm not in a position to give a completely unemotional analysis .
i would n't right now claim that germany , objectively , everything considered , is the leading team in the world .
that would just raise doubts about my soccer expertise .
but i do say i 'm hopeful , they could get up there .
and any team who 's there in the final , any team who 's prepared to lose against germany 2-1 in the final match , is fine by me .
actually that 's all 31 other teams .
the key thing would be us winning .
and if we do n't , it will still be a great world cup , that 's clear . christian f. trippe interviewed wolfgang schäuble send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de security risks reassessed as us world cup team arrives the arrival of the us team to take up their heavily-guarded headquarters in a central hotel in hamburg was an early test for the world cup 's security arrangements .

do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?
will we really be able to completely fulfill the promise of the motto : " a time to make frie n ds " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us soccer team has begun training in hamburg of course .
you can already feel that .
whenever a team arrives here - and most of them are here now - people celebrate .
the great majority of germans are open-minded , they 're not xenophobic , they 're happy the world is coming to visit us , they 're looking forward to this wonderful experience , and the incredible diversity and color of this world championship .
and we will prevent the tiny minority - if they have n't already been won over by the enthusiasm of the great majority - from doing any harm .
and they will be isolated by majority of the fans - who just do n't want this . we 've also had a rather u n pleasa n t debate here i n germa n y about so-called " n o-go-areas . "
some politicia n s , some orga n izatio n s , also some embassies , are war n i n g fa n s with a clear n o n -europea n backgrou n d , n ot to go i n to certai n areas , particularly i n easter n germa n y , sayi n g it 's too da n gerous for them there , that too ma n y pote n tially viole n t right-wi n g extremists live there .

but there are areas where people may be less safe , especially at night .
that 's why i 'm telling the local police that we need a stronger police presence .
but we do n't just need a police presence during the day ; we especially need it in the evening .
that 's more difficult with duty hours .
all the authorities , all the state interior ministers are in agreement that we have to tackle this .

i n 1990 , schäuble was paralyzed after he was shot by a n assassi n . dw-tv : as germa n y 's i n terior mi n ister you are also i n charge of sport policy .
how far do you thi n k germa n y will go i n the soccer world cup ? schäuble : i 'm not only the sports minister ; i 'm also an enthusiastic soccer fan .
and a real fan always hopes his team will win . germa n y hosted the world cup fi n als o n ce before , 32 years ago .
west germa n y beat holla n d 2-1 i n the fi n al .
do you remember that day i n summer of 1974 ? very clearly .
even though i was still quite young , i had the amazing good fortune to be at the final - my wife , was too - and we sat next to the soccer legend fritz walter .
it was fantastic .
and we were in rome in 1990 - i was interior minister at the time - when germany again won the world cup .
my wife has only attended two major matches - and each time she saw the germans become world champions .
if germany makes it to the final , she has promised to come .
all i can say is : whenever i was interior minister , germany became world champions .
so it 's looking good . as i n terior mi n ister you are respo n sible for security at the world cup fi n als .
what 's the greatest challe n ge ?
is it hooliga n s - or is it the possibility of terrorist attacks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 10,000 fans will be watching games in a miniature version of berlin 's olympic stadium that 's been built in front of the german parliament the greatest challenge , in my view , has to do with something else .
for the first time , " public viewing " is going to be a major factor - not just in the stadiums , where the matches are actually played , but all over the country on large screens - accompanied by parties and celebrations and events .
we are , however , very well prepared .
as the chair of the conference of state interior ministers pointed out , there 's probably never been such careful preparation for an event as big as this .
of course no one can ever guarantee one hundred per cent security , but the chances are good .
people will feel safe . what ki n d of security measures will there be to protect the teams from the us a n d ira n - both of which may n eed special protectio n ? they will be protected in their quarters by german police .
and it 's likely that the americans and the iranians will also have their own security measures .
our intelligence services are gathering all information which could give any indication of a threat .
so we 're doing whatever can be done . security at the games also mea n s security for the hu n dreds of thousa n ds of fa n s from all over the world .
ca n you tell the fa n s that germa n y is safe ?

not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t . the whole stadium was build in that time - that would mean tear down the whole stadium ?
by the way these sculptures look more like gay people out of a gay magazine to me .
nothing new and not noticeable at all and one would easily overlook them if none would point with a historical finger to them .
keep them .
they are a part of the german history no matter whether we like the history or not . - axel schu n n these statues are depictions of athletes as they are still competing today .
they do not bear a swastika or any other nationalistic emblems .
to remove and / or destroy them would emanate the nazis ' book burning . - ola f he n n y bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rome 's colosseum should the coliseum in rome be torn down because thousands upon thousands of christians were persecuted and massacred there in the most hideous of ways ?
i think the sculptures should remain right where there are as a historical testimony to a political philosophy which caused the destructions of millions .
what might be called for is a plague or some other sign which explains the history surrounding the olympic stadium .
again if you remove the statues you may as well remove the entire stadium since it was built by a nazi architect and paid for by the nsdap .
no statues , no stadium , no games . - james e. hei n ze not included in the discussion was the artistic value of the works .
it seems to me that a good deal of junk is piling up around us in the name of " art . "
frankly , karl albiker 's discus thrower and relay racer , illustrated at the beginning of the article , fall into this category .
they are not art , but merely technical decoration .
art must speak to the observer as well as from the artist .
great art embodies the sense of beauty , or truth , or injustice , or whatever it is embodying .
as an example , in vincent van gogh 's " the potato eaters , " the sense of the honesty , the earthiness of the people just oozes from the painting .
on the other hand , albiker 's sculptures look like rocks in the form of people .
maybe it 's because they are n't doing anything .
in fact , it may be a sign of the intellectual bankruptcy of the nazi regime that they could n't produce any great art .
they could produce large buildings , but nothing that inspires the observer with the sense of wonder .
destroying some nazi art is no loss . - jo n atha n miller bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can albiker 's work be compared to classical statues ?
i do n't think the statues should be destroyed , but i agree with the idea of putting explanatory plaques next to them .
they do n't seem much different than " ideals of beauty " that we now see as classical art from roman and greek periods , do they ? - patricia fogarty when one has been hurt by something as horrific as the nazi era it is easy to want to shatter any sign or symbol .
growing up black in the us , i know hatred and racism .
the fact however is that art allows one to see life and thoughts of those during times that we are not familiar with .
covering up or removing art made to celebrate life would be a joke .
it shows that as a race we are not strong enough to handle life .
the statues should stay as a reminder to all that hatred and racism never win . - ale her n do n , califor n ia , us i think to destroy the statues would be a crime .
yes , they represent a dark past that all would like to forget .
but to destroy them would be to me the same as destroying and saying that the concentration camps should be gone because they remind us of a dark time in the world history .
in high school , i had a history teacher who said : " if you fail to study history then you are doomed to repeat it . "
i know it is not original , but it is so true . - m .
needham the statues are symbolic of the nazi era , however they are historical art .
was the artist convicted of war crimes and a known supporter ?
or was he perhaps well regarded by the nazis as an artist and it was in his best interest to cooperate and produce the art ?
if there are no concrete answers / convictions attached to these questions than the art should stay . - peter schmidhuber preserving the truth is always best .
christoph stölzl had the best idea - keep them and explain them .
destroying the past is not good , even for those who advocate it .
if you go to charleston , south carolina , usa , today , you will find the old slave market in the downtown area .
slavery was a horrible tragedy , but it is good that the slave market remains .
the same with auschwitz - it should remain as a reminder .
when you think about the statues in this context , it is quite apparent that they are simply part of germany 's history - which except for 12 years has been glorious - and they should stay . - wiley hor n e , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's olympic stadium was built by the nazis for the 1936 games i think it is a mistake to remove and / or destroy art created during the nazi regime .
the mentality here is that anyone who created art that was commissioned during this period created " tainted " art .
i do not agree with this position .
my great-aunt was to create a mural in the city hall of berlin 's schöneberg district , but the start of the war prevented the work from ever having been created .
my aunt was by no means a nazi , she was an artist .
similarly , the sculptures created during this era reflect the human form .
if these were in a public space in the united states there would be calls to cover them because of the nudity .
no matter how dark the past was , we need to preserve art .
in the case of these statues , they are not adorned with nazi propaganda .
i doubt that the majority of people attending events at the stadium would know that these were created during the nazi era . - albert greuter i am in favor of the preservation with the same arguments as stephan kramer -lrb- from the german central jewish council -rrb- because i think the giordano-rosh kind of exorcism is not compatible with a rational civilized behavior and in addition may have the opposite effect of what they naively intend .
the other day i was invited to the home of a jewish friend in petropolis , near rio de janeiro .
i was stunned to see the art deco mixed with nazi sculptures even including some hardware pieces from the ss .
perplexed i asked him how come that he surrounds him with these kinds of objects .
he said : " but i survived and they are dead . "
his parents fled with him from the island of rhodes shortly before the whole jewish population of rhodes was imprisoned and killed . - b ert schroer the very fact that these statues have remained in public view is just another testament to german ambivalence regarding their past .
i say leave the sculptures there , illustrating to the world the persistent insincerity germany continues to exhibit for their prior heinous activities . - kurt brick n er bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a buddha statue that was later destroyed by afghanistan 's taliban regime art of whatever origins should be respected and understood for what it is : a reflection of a period in time - whether is a good or a bad period .
the taliban blew up the mountain buddahs .
it was a horrible thing to do .
art should be viewed with respect , no matter how different our religious or political views .
intolerance was the base for conflict .
what can make free nations different from the nazis and other fanatic group is precisely : tolerance . - g. m. rodriguez compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

the state of thuringia is the nerve center of sophisticated and innovative optical technology . former communist east germany may today be associated with renovated prefabricated housing blocks and empty city centers .
but the city of jena in the eastern german state of thuringia effortlessly defies that image . the place is a hive of activity these days .
not only is it a major center for the optics industry there is also a technology and innovations park with around 60 firms and several research centers on the campus of the university of applied sciences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an employee of jenoptik with diode lasers .
one of the most innovative companies is jenoptik which focuses on six areas of expertise .
according to jenoptik 's norbert thiel , lasers and particularly diode lasers are an important focus of attention and will continue to be so in the future . " it 's very clear the laser processing material markets will be one of our main investments in the future .
a huge market which is coming up is the laser soldering and laser welding , " said thiel . " and the second point of diode lasers is the medicine market .
for example , hair removal is a huge market for laser diodes . " aerospace and back to earth another area that jenoptik is increasingly trying to gain a foothold in is aerospace . the famous multi-spectral camera was developed in jena for the russian mir space project .
norbert thiel points out that today jenoptik is very active in a current aerospace project called rapid eye . " we analyze with this camera from space the chlorophyll content of the earth so we can make direct earth observations , " thiel pointed out .
" we are a market leader in the field of sensor technology .
we are n't intending to assemble and design satellites but we are very much focused on this technology in the future . " back on earth , life is destined to get difficult for speeding motorists following the work done by jenoptik together with its partner company robot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motorists will have to watch out next time they 're speeding jenoptik has developed a speed measurement system based on lasers .
and , says thiel , the future will be in digital speed cameras .
so there will be no film to replace and a speeding motorist wo n't even know he 's been caught . " we have a lot of expertise here .
if you measure a distance five times in very short pulses you get the velocity , you get the speed of a car .
we developed a speed measurement system based on lasers . so digital camera , the future will be an infrared flash . " cures for cancer and multiple sclerosis jena is also home to a range of top-notch research institutes such as the institute for physical high technology which performs research and development projects in the areas of magnetics , quantum electronics , micro-systems and laser technology . a further top address for cutting-edge research is the renowned beutenberg campus in jena .
it includes several research institutes which link the fields of physics and optics to new applications in the life sciences . wacker biotech is a prominent example .
its core focus is in the manufacture of so-called biologics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new class of molecules is hoped to find cures for cancers " these are active ingredients for pharmaceuticals .
this is a new class of molecules which developed during the last , i would say , 30 years and what we normally know is so called small molecules , " explained wacker 's anke suter .
" they 're used in the treatment of cancers , multiple sclerosis and because they are proteins they can act in a way that synthesized molecules ca n't currently .
this is a new market and it is strongly growing with an average growth rate of 16 per cent , " suter added . " software is the key driver " another big name on the jena research landscape is carl zeiss , which was founded in 1846 as a workshop for precision mechanics and optics in jena and quickly gained a worldwide reputation for the high quality of its products . " i think innovation is the key of what our business is all about , " said ulrich simon , president and chief executive of carl zeiss micro imaging in jena .
" innovation is the core driver .
we generate a lot of patents , roughly two patents a day over the entire organization , " he added . it 's obvious that the future for carl zeiss lies in automation and miniaturization . " to really turn data in information knowledge - i think that will be the key driver for the future business , " said simon .
" software is one of the key drivers .
what you want to do in the end is you just put a sample into the laptop and get out the information , by just hitting one button .

for example , hair removal is a huge market for laser diodes . " aerospace and back to earth another area that jenoptik is increasingly trying to gain a foothold in is aerospace . the famous multi-spectral camera was developed in jena for the russian mir space project .
norbert thiel points out that today jenoptik is very active in a current aerospace project called rapid eye . " we analyze with this camera from space the chlorophyll content of the earth so we can make direct earth observations , " thiel pointed out .
" we are a market leader in the field of sensor technology .
we are n't intending to assemble and design satellites but we are very much focused on this technology in the future . " back on earth , life is destined to get difficult for speeding motorists following the work done by jenoptik together with its partner company robot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motorists will have to watch out next time they 're speeding jenoptik has developed a speed measurement system based on lasers .
and , says thiel , the future will be in digital speed cameras .
so there will be no film to replace and a speeding motorist wo n't even know he 's been caught . " we have a lot of expertise here .
if you measure a distance five times in very short pulses you get the velocity , you get the speed of a car .
we developed a speed measurement system based on lasers . so digital camera , the future will be an infrared flash . " cures for cancer and multiple sclerosis jena is also home to a range of top-notch research institutes such as the institute for physical high technology which performs research and development projects in the areas of magnetics , quantum electronics , micro-systems and laser technology . a further top address for cutting-edge research is the renowned beutenberg campus in jena .
it includes several research institutes which link the fields of physics and optics to new applications in the life sciences . wacker biotech is a prominent example .
its core focus is in the manufacture of so-called biologics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new class of molecules is hoped to find cures for cancers " these are active ingredients for pharmaceuticals .
this is a new class of molecules which developed during the last , i would say , 30 years and what we normally know is so called small molecules , " explained wacker 's anke suter .
" they 're used in the treatment of cancers , multiple sclerosis and because they are proteins they can act in a way that synthesized molecules ca n't currently .
this is a new market and it is strongly growing with an average growth rate of 16 per cent , " suter added . " software is the key driver " another big name on the jena research landscape is carl zeiss , which was founded in 1846 as a workshop for precision mechanics and optics in jena and quickly gained a worldwide reputation for the high quality of its products . " i think innovation is the key of what our business is all about , " said ulrich simon , president and chief executive of carl zeiss micro imaging in jena .
" innovation is the core driver .
we generate a lot of patents , roughly two patents a day over the entire organization , " he added . it 's obvious that the future for carl zeiss lies in automation and miniaturization . " to really turn data in information knowledge - i think that will be the key driver for the future business , " said simon .
" software is one of the key drivers .
what you want to do in the end is you just put a sample into the laptop and get out the information , by just hitting one button .
this will be our vision .

hiv / aids was first identified among the gay community it was the first time that the fatal disease of the immune system - or aids , as it came to be known - was brought to the attention of the medical community .
the initial medical report amounted to just two sheets of a4 paper - and just several hundred words in total .
when the american doctors in california reported five cases of previously healthy gay men suffering a bizarre immune disorder , they had no idea of the significance of their discovery .
map of current worldwide hiv infection rates professor andrew saxon was among that team , and is still working in immunology : " we actually called this gay related immune deficiency .
thank god that name did n't stick .
we thought it was something related to the gay lifestyle - and we had no idea it was a virus professor andrew saxon timeline : 25 years of aids have your say " we thought it was something related to the gay lifestyle - and we had no idea it was a virus .
" we were specialists in immunology , rather than public health , and so we did n't realise the worldwide enormity of this . "
' a certain destiny ' the five men mentioned in the original report all died within two years of its publication .
professor saxon said : " i knew them all personally because i helped take care of each of them .
" they were the end stage of hiv and we had nothing to treat them with . "
the ' do n't die of ignorance ' campaign was used to alert the uk public to aids as the american doctors filed their report , similar cases were emerging in france .
more cases emerged in countries around the world over the next few years , leading to public awareness initiatives such as the uk 's campaign in 1987 which used images of tombstones and icebergs .
it was a potent reminder of how a condition - initially labelled a gay cancer - was a potential threat to everyone 's health .
the announcements warned : " the virus can be passed during sexual intercourse with an infected person ...
if you ignore aids , it could be the death of you - so do n't die of ignorance . "
garry wall was by then more than familiar with aids - because people he cared about were dying from the disease .
" friends were being diagnosed at an alarming rate - altogether 32 close acquaintances and friends have died of aids . "
garry was infected with hiv during his first gay sexual encounter in 1982 , and began to suspect he was carrying the virus as the 1980s progressed .
he was diagnosed with aids in 1995 .
feelings of guilt " having an hiv diagnosis is quite serious in itself - but there 's a definite end to having aids , " he said .
this virus is n't going away dr simon portsmouth , st mary 's hospital the paper that described aids " when you 're told you have aids , you know there 's a certain destiny .
" i was told that i would not live to see the millennium , and not to prepare for my 40th birthday , which was in 2002 . "
in fact , garry is now 44 .
he has a number of voluntary jobs - including work for a leading aids charity , the terrence higgins trust - and he enjoys a good quality of life .
although initially sceptical about the way in which the anti-retroviral drugs were launched in a blaze of publicity 10 years ago , garry acknowledges the way they have transformed care for hiv patients - and how they helped him , once he decided to start taking them .
garry has responded to hiv by becoming an expert patient - he meticulously researches all aspects of his treatment and manages his condition as carefully as he can .
he sometimes feels guilty that he 's alive when so many friends have died .
" we certainly did n't know that by the beginning of the 21st century we would be able to be treated for this - and it would become a chronic condition as opposed to a terminal condition , " he reflected .
young ' taking risks ' if the infection is picked up early enough , people getting an hiv diagnosis now will often be told they can enjoy a normal life expectancy - and their medication might be as basic as two pills a day .
that 's the good news .
but early hopes that the virus behind aids could be eradicated have n't been fulfilled .
in 1984 , united states government scientists announced they had identified hiv .
they were predicting that in two to three years they would find a vaccine to prevent aids .
but even now , some experts feel it 's best not to hazard a guess as to when there might be an hiv vaccine .
there 's intensive research , but no magic breakthrough yet .
one of britain 's busiest hiv clinics is at st mary 's hospital in west london .
soothing classical music plays in the background on the day ward there , where patients have blood tests and sometimes transfusions .
dr simon portsmouth , one of the consultants , said : " about half of our patients are gay men .
it seems that some younger gay men are probably taking more risks .
" and many other patients are from african communities in london .
again , this seems to be increasing . "
hiv is a virus with relatively few genes - but it mutates rapidly as it spreads through the body .
dr portsmouth is concerned that many cases among those two key groups of people go undiagnosed .
and resistance to the anti-retroviral drugs is a problem too .
" about a third of the patients we look after have drug resistance , " he said .
" and about 10 % of people in london have drug resistance before they even start their treatment . "
twenty-five years on , hiv is very much still with us .
but as someone who began working in this field when there were daily deaths on the wards , dr portsmouth tries to remain optimistic .
" this is one of the few areas of medicine where things really have changed in the last 10 years .
" the depressing thing is that this virus is n't going away .
more people are taking risks and people are still coming to us far too late and are untreatable . "
garry , on his way to his next appointment at st mary 's , paid tribute to the doctors there for keeping him alive .
i asked what message he 'd give to people reading about hiv .
" do n't get hiv , " he said .
" i 'm managing to survive but it 's not always pleasurable and i sometimes wonder what it 's all for .

hiv / aids was first identified among the gay community it was the first time that the fatal disease of the immune system - or aids , as it came to be known - was brought to the attention of the medical community .
the initial medical report amounted to just two sheets of a4 paper - and just several hundred words in total .
when the american doctors in california reported five cases of previously healthy gay men suffering a bizarre immune disorder , they had no idea of the significance of their discovery .
map of current worldwide hiv infection rates professor andrew saxon was among that team , and is still working in immunology : " we actually called this gay related immune deficiency .
thank god that name did n't stick .
we thought it was something related to the gay lifestyle - and we had no idea it was a virus professor andrew saxon timeline : 25 years of aids have your say " we thought it was something related to the gay lifestyle - and we had no idea it was a virus .
" we were specialists in immunology , rather than public health , and so we did n't realise the worldwide enormity of this . "
' a certain destiny ' the five men mentioned in the original report all died within two years of its publication .
professor saxon said : " i knew them all personally because i helped take care of each of them .
" they were the end stage of hiv and we had nothing to treat them with . "
the ' do n't die of ignorance ' campaign was used to alert the uk public to aids as the american doctors filed their report , similar cases were emerging in france .
more cases emerged in countries around the world over the next few years , leading to public awareness initiatives such as the uk 's campaign in 1987 which used images of tombstones and icebergs .
it was a potent reminder of how a condition - initially labelled a gay cancer - was a potential threat to everyone 's health .
the announcements warned : " the virus can be passed during sexual intercourse with an infected person ...
if you ignore aids , it could be the death of you - so do n't die of ignorance . "
garry wall was by then more than familiar with aids - because people he cared about were dying from the disease .
" friends were being diagnosed at an alarming rate - altogether 32 close acquaintances and friends have died of aids . "
garry was infected with hiv during his first gay sexual encounter in 1982 , and began to suspect he was carrying the virus as the 1980s progressed .
he was diagnosed with aids in 1995 .
feelings of guilt " having an hiv diagnosis is quite serious in itself - but there 's a definite end to having aids , " he said .
this virus is n't going away dr simon portsmouth , st mary 's hospital the paper that described aids " when you 're told you have aids , you know there 's a certain destiny .

joe boyd , an american who first travelled to england in 1964 , was one of the pivotal figures of the 1960s rock scene .
as well as producing pink floyd 's first single and nick drake 's first album , he ran the famous ufo club in london .
his recollections of the period are contained in his book white bicycles .
he told bbc world service 's the beat programme he hoped that era would be remembered as the " golden age " of music .
" it was a great time - there was a fluidity about things , " he said .
" things were n't very nailed down then . "
pivotal moment boyd was initially famous for his work with british folk groups such as the incredible string band and fairport convention .
but he was also instrumental in one of the most controversial moments in folk music history - when , as production manager of the event , he plugged in bob dylan 's guitar at the 1965 folk festival on rhode island . "
the appeal of pink floyd was that it was something that i could n't quite figure out " joe boyd the moment " dylan went electric " is still regarded as a turning point in music history - although many in the crowd at the time disapproved and greeted it with booing .
boyd recalled first meeting dylan in early 1963 at a party where the singer was playing guitar on a bed .
" there was something about it that was so confident and so authoritative , i just sat down , " boyd said .
" there he was , sitting on the bed , singing a hard rain 's gonna fall .
i just could n't believe it .
it just hit me .
" i was reeling from the impact of it - it was so amazing .
" it was really one of my most memorable music experiences .
i never doubted him after that . "
toward the end of the decade , boyd began to work more with psychedelic rock acts , producing pink floyd 's debut single arnold layne .
he said he was first attracted to the sound because he struggled to understand it at first .
" the appeal for me was that it was something that i could n't quite figure out , " he said .
" then , hearing the floyd and hearing the echoes of the blues band that they had once been , i could relate to it more . "
world music move meanwhile , fairport convention 's bassist ashley hutchings had discovered cult folk musician nick drake .
boyd went on to produce drake 's first two albums , five leaves left and bryter layter and both are regarded as classics .
boyd also set up london 's ufo club , at which many of the most influential bands of the ' 60s played .
he went on to make rem 's third album fables of the reconstruction and was executive producer on the 1988 film scandal about the profumo affair .
he then moved on to set up his own label , hannibal records , which put out world music .
" i always loved world music - i used to get stoned and listen to the mystere de voix bulgare choir in the 1960s , all my friends did , " boyd said .
" one thing i discovered at hannibal was that if you 're releasing a record by the greatest folk singer in hungary , in some ways that 's a lot easier than saying ' this is a great singer-songwriter singing in english and strumming a guitar ' .
" because the week you release that , there 's 180 other singer-songwriters with guitars singing in english also being released , also saying their guy is the best .
" but there 's nobody else releasing the greatest singer from hungary .
" so as a practical matter , running the greatest independent record label , i discovered that it was actually more realistic to be in the world music business than the contemporary music business . "

joe boyd , an american who first travelled to england in 1964 , was one of the pivotal figures of the 1960s rock scene .
as well as producing pink floyd 's first single and nick drake 's first album , he ran the famous ufo club in london .
his recollections of the period are contained in his book white bicycles .
he told bbc world service 's the beat programme he hoped that era would be remembered as the " golden age " of music .
" it was a great time - there was a fluidity about things , " he said .
" things were n't very nailed down then . "
pivotal moment boyd was initially famous for his work with british folk groups such as the incredible string band and fairport convention .
but he was also instrumental in one of the most controversial moments in folk music history - when , as production manager of the event , he plugged in bob dylan 's guitar at the 1965 folk festival on rhode island .
the appeal of pink floyd was that it was something that i could n't quite figure out joe boyd the moment " dylan went electric " is still regarded as a turning point in music history - although many in the crowd at the time disapproved and greeted it with booing .
boyd recalled first meeting dylan in early 1963 at a party where the singer was playing guitar on a bed .
" there was something about it that was so confident and so authoritative , i just sat down , " boyd said .
" there he was , sitting on the bed , singing a hard rain 's gonna fall .
i just could n't believe it .
it just hit me .
" i was reeling from the impact of it - it was so amazing .
" it was really one of my most memorable music experiences .
i never doubted him after that . "
toward the end of the decade , boyd began to work more with psychedelic rock acts , producing pink floyd 's debut single arnold layne .
he said he was first attracted to the sound because he struggled to understand it at first .
" the appeal for me was that it was something that i could n't quite figure out , " he said .
" then , hearing the floyd and hearing the echoes of the blues band that they had once been , i could relate to it more . "
world music move meanwhile , fairport convention 's bassist ashley hutchings had discovered cult folk musician nick drake .
boyd went on to produce drake 's first two albums , five leaves left and bryter layter and both are regarded as classics .
boyd was literally instrumental in dylan going electric boyd also set up london 's ufo club , at which many of the most influential bands of the ' 60s played .
he went on to make rem 's third album fables of the reconstruction and was executive producer on the 1988 film scandal about the profumo affair .
he then moved on to set up his own label , hannibal records , which put out world music .
" i always loved world music - i used to get stoned and listen to the mystere de voix bulgare choir in the 1960s , all my friends did , " boyd said .
" one thing i discovered at hannibal was that if you 're releasing a record by the greatest folk singer in hungary , in some ways that 's a lot easier than saying ' this is a great singer-songwriter singing in english and strumming a guitar ' .
" because the week you release that , there 's 180 other singer-songwriters with guitars singing in english also being released , also saying their guy is the best .

the inaugural swansea bay film festival line-up was chosen by internet votes .
the swansea area has a fine film heritage , including zeta jones , richard burton and sir anthony hopkins , and it is hoped the festival will become an annual event .
there will also be a series of lectures before an awards ceremony on thursday .
playwright binda singh , who helped launch the festival , said even though it was in its infancy it had attracted entrants from as far afield as canada , new zealand and columbia .
" we 've had over 1,000 inquiries from filmmakers with over 160 submissions , " he explained .
trailers for each had been linked to the festival 's website and for several months people were able to cast their votes on which should be screened .
" we are screening about 70 films and the winners will be chosen by votes cast on the internet and by the panel of judges , " he added .
" to have such a response in the first year has been fantastic . "
" it 's important films , plays - anything that enlarges your interest - are promoted and recognised " victor spinetti among those taking part in question and answer sessions will be john hefin , a former bbc head of drama and the director of cult welsh rugby comedy grand slam , and author james hawes , who wrote rancid aluminium .
uk premieres include fern hill , the story of four children who go in search of a wrecked plane in colorado and loosely based on the dylan thomas poem of the same name , and teenage wasteland which was shot on location in swansea and newport .
the best film and actor awards will be presented by screen and stage character actor victor spinetti , whose many credits include the first three beatles films .
he said : " at one time everything happened in london but now it 's happening in wales .
