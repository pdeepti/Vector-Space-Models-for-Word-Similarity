the calculations by the bonn-based environmental group germanwatch took into account emissions levels , emissions trends and climate policy . sweden , britain and denmark topped the rankings .
but , christoph bals , the director of germanwatch , said the current efforts by the top scorers are not enough to effectively curb and reverse global warming .

much of germany 's initial advances toward the target are due to the collapse of former east germany 's heavily polluting industry . " we 'll have to take tougher measures , " gabriel said .

the law enters into force in november next year and aims to open up competition in financial markets . " we are responding to the mifid legislation by creating an integrated pan-european trading platform where equities can be traded more cost effectively , " said a spokesman for the venture . the move introduces new competition for the venerable stock market companies in europe which currently dominate stock trading arrangements . euronext chose nyse over deutsche boerse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euronext has agreed to be taken over by nyse instead of deutsche boerse meanwhile , deutsche börse announced wednesday that it was dropping its pursuit of euronext . the german operator had battled to convince its paris-based rival euronext of the logic of a tie-up in the face of a competitive takeover offer from nyse , which was preferred by euronext management . " deutsche börse has decided not to pursue its plans to merge with euronext , " the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange said in a statement . deutsche börse chairman reto francioni told reporters he did not see " any reason " to make new merger offers to euronext in future , but added , " if they want to come to us , however , they are welcome . " insufficient support for merger with dax the company said the decision was taken because it could not agree with euronext on a merger that would suit both parties , and because deutsche börse shareholders did not stand to gain from the takeover . " mergers in our field can only prove successful if they have the support of the management of both parties as well as that of the industry , " said francioni .
" we are convinced that we can not force an unwilling partner to cooperate . " deutsche börse shares plunged following the announcement on euronext , but rallied soon afterwards . in early morning trading , the price of shares in the german group fell 3.56 percent to 86.60 euros .
shares in euronext lost 3.90 percent to 86.30 euros .
a potential takeover of euronext by deutsche börse had enjoyed widespread political support in europe , but euronext , the operator of the paris , amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges , had insisted that it preferred a tie-up with the new york stock exchange . merkel and chirac preferred european solution in october , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel had backed " a european solution " for european stock markets , a clear signal they favored a merger of euronext and deutsche boerse . francioni said he did not think that a merger between euronext and the nyse was likely to succeed , and said it was " unthinkable " that deutsche börse would try to join in the project . he said the attempt to merge with euronext had cost tens of millions of euros but its failure would not affect his position with deutsche börse . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

" what we need are not necessarily teams winning the champions league , but making the quarterfinals of the uefa cup . " hertha berlin and schalke are already out of that competition after losing to smaller clubs against which they were heavily favored .

" but at the same time we have to win against belgian or french teams . " getting results against underdogs could become even more important , if french soccer legend michel platini gets his way .
platini , who 's vying to become uefa 's next president , says he 'd like to give smaller leagues , especially in eastern europe , more berths in international competitions - at the expense of the continent 's traditional powerhouses . in any case , german soccer fans have to hope that the few german clubs still alive in international competition pick up enough points to brakes on the league 's perilous slide .

german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
experts say any additional efforts will only be successful if countries cooperate with the united states . europe needs to strengthen the dialogue with the united states on the future of iraq , according to german president horst köhler . " the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" that would be dumb , short-sighted and arrogant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said sending more troops would n't help the iraqi security situation the failure of us troops in iraq has proven that europe can rule out helping with military manpower . " that is absolutely impossible , " said markus kaim , european and atlantic security expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the key issue is reinstalling iraq 's statehood , as government authority has no meaning in wide parts of the country . " german defense analyst heinz schulte said europe can support measures to secure the post-war environment in iraq . " europeans can play a constructive role in that transitional period between the withdrawal of american and british forces on the one hand and the establishment of a secure and credible iraqi government that has the means to really keep the country together , " schulte said . european support needs to meet iraq 's needs a major task europeans should increasingly contribute to are security issues , schulte said . " without improving the security situation dramatically , there can not be any reconstruction in terms of infrastructure and other things that need to happen , such as education , sewage work and hospitals , " he said , adding that security training needed to be tailored to iraq 's needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german instructors are helping to train iraqi police " one of the criticisms against the german police training , for example , was that it was too european , " schulte said .
" they were training the police to patrol the streets like in a british , french or german suburb and it had nothing to do with the real situation of hard-boiled violence with a lot of arms in iraq . " but european nations could also play a part in other aspects of developing iraq 's statehood , according to kaim . " in order to build up a legitimate state , iraq also needs a tax system with financial income , it needs to develop a viable judicial system , and it needs economic well-being , " kaim said .
" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play . " the key is getting iran on board and europe can help put pressure on iran to use its influence to stop shia attacks , " said graeme herd , international security expert from the geneva center for security policy in switzerland .
" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground . " and if nothing came out of it , european countries can at least say they tried , " kaim addded . europe needs to speak with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler does n't shy away from controversial issues president köhler said it was in europe 's interest to get involved . " we can not allow the region to slide into chaos , " köhler said .
a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .
" but ducking away and just watching is the worse alternative . " now it is up to europe to find a common policy , schulte said . " i think the old question that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger asked , ' if i have a crisis , whom do i call in europe ? ' is still valid , " schulte said .
" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles . " all that will pressure the europeans into a new role that is n't there yet , " schulte said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

" the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" that would be dumb , short-sighted and arrogant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said sending more troops would n't help the iraqi security situation the failure of us troops in iraq has proven that europe can rule out helping with military manpower . " that is absolutely impossible , " said markus kaim , european and atlantic security expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the key issue is reinstalling iraq 's statehood , as government authority has no meaning in wide parts of the country . " german defense analyst heinz schulte said europe can support measures to secure the post-war environment in iraq . " europeans can play a constructive role in that transitional period between the withdrawal of american and british forces on the one hand and the establishment of a secure and credible iraqi government that has the means to really keep the country together , " schulte said . european support needs to meet iraq 's needs a major task europeans should increasingly contribute to are security issues , schulte said .

" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play .

" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground .

" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles .

" the key is getting iran on board and europe can help put pressure on iran to use its influence to stop shia attacks , " said graeme herd , international security expert from the geneva center for security policy in switzerland .
" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground . " and if nothing came out of it , european countries can at least say they tried , " kaim addded . europe needs to speak with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler does n't shy away from controversial issues president köhler said it was in europe 's interest to get involved . " we can not allow the region to slide into chaos , " köhler said .
a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .
" but ducking away and just watching is the worse alternative . " now it is up to europe to find a common policy , schulte said . " i think the old question that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger asked , ' if i have a crisis , whom do i call in europe ? ' is still valid , " schulte said .
" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles . " all that will pressure the europeans into a new role that is n't there yet , " schulte said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

in a dw-world.de interview , he talked about reasons for continuing problems between the two countries . born in western galicia in 1945 , krzeminski is one of poland 's leading journalists .
he has worked at the polityka newspaper since 1973 .
in 1993 , he received the goethe medal for his efforts to promote german-polish understanding .
he will receive the viadrina award of the european university viadrina frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday . dw-world.de : german-polish relations are tense at the moment .
in germany , the kaczynski brothers - the polish president and the polish prime minister - are blamed for this .
is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .
polish historians worked on the bonn exhibition " escape , expulsion , integration . "
the debate surrounding a center against expulsions as promoted by the federation of expellees , however , deals with a fundamental question : is it possible to look at various expulsion , deportations and flight movements of the 20th century in a single museum without blurring the lines between perpetrators and victims of a war of aggression ?
a second level of the dispute has to do with past of the federation of expellees that has not been dealt with .
if we disentangle the different layers , a common remembrance is possible . is there a danger that the present cooling of the german-polish relationship will become permanent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viadrina university is located in germany and poland during the past years , we have witnessed what 's almost a miracle of good neighborhood .
despite the cold that 's crept into german-polish relations on the political level , normal contacts continue to exist .
along the border there are dozens of towns that have good relationships .
remember the lifting of visa requirements in 1991 , when the first polish tourists were greeted with bats or the bread roll war of the mid-1990s , when german trade unionists demonstrated against their polish competitors .
today , very little of this negative mood has survived in the border region .

maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .
polish historians worked on the bonn exhibition " escape , expulsion , integration . "
the debate surrounding a center against expulsions as promoted by the federation of expellees , however , deals with a fundamental question : is it possible to look at various expulsion , deportations and flight movements of the 20th century in a single museum without blurring the lines between perpetrators and victims of a war of aggression ?
a second level of the dispute has to do with past of the federation of expellees that has not been dealt with .

in a dw-world.de interview , he talked about reasons for continuing problems between the two countries . born in western galicia in 1945 , krzeminski is one of poland 's leading journalists .
he has worked at the polityka newspaper since 1973 .
in 1993 , he received the goethe medal for his efforts to promote german-polish understanding .
he will receive the viadrina award of the european university viadrina frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday . dw-world.de : german-polish relations are tense at the moment .
in germany , the kaczynski brothers - the polish president and the polish prime minister - are blamed for this .
is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .

the calculations by the bonn-based environmental group germanwatch took into account emissions levels , emissions trends and climate policy . sweden , britain and denmark topped the rankings .
but , christoph bals , the director of germanwatch , said the current efforts by the top scorers are not enough to effectively curb and reverse global warming .
even sweden is like a one-eyed king among the blind , he said . the united states - the world ’ s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases - ranked at 53 , with only china , malaysia and saudi arabia doing worse . what happens after 2012 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel is in nairobi for the climate change conference the index 's release came as the world 's environment ministers gathered in the kenyan capital nairobi for the decisive phase of the un climate change conference . the ministers are under pressure to develop a framework to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . the german delegation at the conference , which finishes on friday , is led by environment minister sigmar gabriel . germany 's emissions on the rise before leaving for nairobi , gabriel said that based on preliminary data , germany 's carbon dioxide emissions actually rose in 2003 and 2004 .
he said this was due to increases in emissions from power plants and industry , even though they had promised to cut those emissions . " that means we will have to tighten the screws even further , " gabriel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf says germany 's frimmersdorf coal-fired power plant is the second worst climate polluter in europe .
under the kyoto protocol , germany is committed to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 .
much of germany 's initial advances toward the target are due to the collapse of former east germany 's heavily polluting industry . " we 'll have to take tougher measures , " gabriel said .
" despite their requirements to cut co2 emissions , power plants and the industry actually increased those .
evidently , they exported more power or older power plants were used . " " if we do n't reach our targets , then it will be difficult to convince the developing and newly industrialized countries to agree to a post-kyoto protocol , " he said . gabriel also stressed the need to help developing countries adapt to climate change because they were n't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions causing the problems .
the situation in africa " is dramatic " , he said . us wakes up to climate change but gabriel said he saw welcome signals from the united states , even before last week 's elections where the democrats gained control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : californian gov. arnold schwarzenegger introduced the first us cap on greenhouse gases " the political climate in the united states on climate change has improved , " he said .
" it 's interesting that a republican governor , arnold schwarzenegger , bucked the trend and won .
others are now saying ' we have to do more ' . " the us , which produces around a quarter of the world 's greenhouse gases , has refused to sign the kyoto protocol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 15.11.2006 " we 're really way ahead of the politicians " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krzeminski : " i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other " polish journalist adam krzeminski on thursday will be honored for his efforts to improve german-polish relations .
in a dw-world.de interview , he talked about reasons for continuing problems between the two countries . born in western galicia in 1945 , krzeminski is one of poland 's leading journalists .
he has worked at the polityka newspaper since 1973 .
in 1993 , he received the goethe medal for his efforts to promote german-polish understanding .
he will receive the viadrina award of the european university viadrina frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday . dw-world.de : german-polish relations are tense at the moment .
in germany , the kaczynski brothers - the polish president and the polish prime minister - are blamed for this .
is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .
polish historians worked on the bonn exhibition " escape , expulsion , integration . "
the debate surrounding a center against expulsions as promoted by the federation of expellees , however , deals with a fundamental question : is it possible to look at various expulsion , deportations and flight movements of the 20th century in a single museum without blurring the lines between perpetrators and victims of a war of aggression ?
a second level of the dispute has to do with past of the federation of expellees that has not been dealt with .
if we disentangle the different layers , a common remembrance is possible . is there a danger that the present cooling of the german-polish relationship will become permanent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viadrina university is located in germany and poland during the past years , we have witnessed what 's almost a miracle of good neighborhood .
despite the cold that 's crept into german-polish relations on the political level , normal contacts continue to exist .
along the border there are dozens of towns that have good relationships .
remember the lifting of visa requirements in 1991 , when the first polish tourists were greeted with bats or the bread roll war of the mid-1990s , when german trade unionists demonstrated against their polish competitors .
today , very little of this negative mood has survived in the border region .
we 're really way ahead of the politicians . dennis stute interviewed adam krzeminski -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .

german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
experts say any additional efforts will only be successful if countries cooperate with the united states . europe needs to strengthen the dialogue with the united states on the future of iraq , according to german president horst köhler . " the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" that would be dumb , short-sighted and arrogant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said sending more troops would n't help the iraqi security situation the failure of us troops in iraq has proven that europe can rule out helping with military manpower . " that is absolutely impossible , " said markus kaim , european and atlantic security expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the key issue is reinstalling iraq 's statehood , as government authority has no meaning in wide parts of the country . " german defense analyst heinz schulte said europe can support measures to secure the post-war environment in iraq . " europeans can play a constructive role in that transitional period between the withdrawal of american and british forces on the one hand and the establishment of a secure and credible iraqi government that has the means to really keep the country together , " schulte said . european support needs to meet iraq 's needs a major task europeans should increasingly contribute to are security issues , schulte said . " without improving the security situation dramatically , there can not be any reconstruction in terms of infrastructure and other things that need to happen , such as education , sewage work and hospitals , " he said , adding that security training needed to be tailored to iraq 's needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german instructors are helping to train iraqi police " one of the criticisms against the german police training , for example , was that it was too european , " schulte said .
" they were training the police to patrol the streets like in a british , french or german suburb and it had nothing to do with the real situation of hard-boiled violence with a lot of arms in iraq . " but european nations could also play a part in other aspects of developing iraq 's statehood , according to kaim . " in order to build up a legitimate state , iraq also needs a tax system with financial income , it needs to develop a viable judicial system , and it needs economic well-being , " kaim said .
" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play . " the key is getting iran on board and europe can help put pressure on iran to use its influence to stop shia attacks , " said graeme herd , international security expert from the geneva center for security policy in switzerland .
" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground . " and if nothing came out of it , european countries can at least say they tried , " kaim addded . europe needs to speak with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler does n't shy away from controversial issues president köhler said it was in europe 's interest to get involved . " we can not allow the region to slide into chaos , " köhler said .
a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .
" but ducking away and just watching is the worse alternative . " now it is up to europe to find a common policy , schulte said . " i think the old question that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger asked , ' if i have a crisis , whom do i call in europe ? ' is still valid , " schulte said .
" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles . " all that will pressure the europeans into a new role that is n't there yet , " schulte said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .
but her small election margin meant she was forced into a difficult partnership with the left-wing social democrats instead . ' adding to political apathy ' now , westerwelle is one of the loudest critics of the current administration , which he blames for failing to bring about a real economic recovery in germany . " the worrying thing about this so-called grand coalition is that it 's contributing to a shocking degree of political apathy , " the 44-year-old politician told reuters on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , ' the grand coalition ' has been a disappointment " we can not allow this grand coalition to lead to the same end as the last one in 1969 , when the far-right npd nearly made it into the federal parliament . " the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- came close to reaching the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the bundestag in 1969 , when germany 's only other post-war " grand coalition " was voted out of office after three difficult years . npd compared to nazis the npd is often compared with hitler 's early nazi party .
it is especially strong in the depressed eastern part of the country .
in september , it took 7.3 percent of the vote in merkel 's home base of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
disillusionment with her coalition was seen as a key reason for the npd 's gains . in the interview , westerwelle attacked merkel 's government for pushing through the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , for failing to reduce non-wage labor costs and for creating more bureaucracy - all moves he said ran counter to the campaign pledges of the governing parties . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .

german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
experts say any additional efforts will only be successful if countries cooperate with the united states . europe needs to strengthen the dialogue with the united states on the future of iraq , according to german president horst köhler . " the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" that would be dumb , short-sighted and arrogant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said sending more troops would n't help the iraqi security situation the failure of us troops in iraq has proven that europe can rule out helping with military manpower . " that is absolutely impossible , " said markus kaim , european and atlantic security expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the key issue is reinstalling iraq 's statehood , as government authority has no meaning in wide parts of the country . " german defense analyst heinz schulte said europe can support measures to secure the post-war environment in iraq . " europeans can play a constructive role in that transitional period between the withdrawal of american and british forces on the one hand and the establishment of a secure and credible iraqi government that has the means to really keep the country together , " schulte said . european support needs to meet iraq 's needs a major task europeans should increasingly contribute to are security issues , schulte said . " without improving the security situation dramatically , there can not be any reconstruction in terms of infrastructure and other things that need to happen , such as education , sewage work and hospitals , " he said , adding that security training needed to be tailored to iraq 's needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german instructors are helping to train iraqi police " one of the criticisms against the german police training , for example , was that it was too european , " schulte said .
" they were training the police to patrol the streets like in a british , french or german suburb and it had nothing to do with the real situation of hard-boiled violence with a lot of arms in iraq . " but european nations could also play a part in other aspects of developing iraq 's statehood , according to kaim . " in order to build up a legitimate state , iraq also needs a tax system with financial income , it needs to develop a viable judicial system , and it needs economic well-being , " kaim said .
" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play . " the key is getting iran on board and europe can help put pressure on iran to use its influence to stop shia attacks , " said graeme herd , international security expert from the geneva center for security policy in switzerland .
" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground . " and if nothing came out of it , european countries can at least say they tried , " kaim addded . europe needs to speak with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler does n't shy away from controversial issues president köhler said it was in europe 's interest to get involved . " we can not allow the region to slide into chaos , " köhler said .
a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .
" but ducking away and just watching is the worse alternative . " now it is up to europe to find a common policy , schulte said . " i think the old question that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger asked , ' if i have a crisis , whom do i call in europe ? ' is still valid , " schulte said .
" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles .

" schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles .

the law enters into force in november next year and aims to open up competition in financial markets . " we are responding to the mifid legislation by creating an integrated pan-european trading platform where equities can be traded more cost effectively , " said a spokesman for the venture . the move introduces new competition for the venerable stock market companies in europe which currently dominate stock trading arrangements . euronext chose nyse over deutsche boerse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euronext has agreed to be taken over by nyse instead of deutsche boerse meanwhile , deutsche börse announced wednesday that it was dropping its pursuit of euronext . the german operator had battled to convince its paris-based rival euronext of the logic of a tie-up in the face of a competitive takeover offer from nyse , which was preferred by euronext management . " deutsche börse has decided not to pursue its plans to merge with euronext , " the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange said in a statement . deutsche börse chairman reto francioni told reporters he did not see " any reason " to make new merger offers to euronext in future , but added , " if they want to come to us , however , they are welcome . " insufficient support for merger with dax the company said the decision was taken because it could not agree with euronext on a merger that would suit both parties , and because deutsche börse shareholders did not stand to gain from the takeover . " mergers in our field can only prove successful if they have the support of the management of both parties as well as that of the industry , " said francioni .
" we are convinced that we can not force an unwilling partner to cooperate . " deutsche börse shares plunged following the announcement on euronext , but rallied soon afterwards . in early morning trading , the price of shares in the german group fell 3.56 percent to 86.60 euros .
shares in euronext lost 3.90 percent to 86.30 euros .
a potential takeover of euronext by deutsche börse had enjoyed widespread political support in europe , but euronext , the operator of the paris , amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges , had insisted that it preferred a tie-up with the new york stock exchange . merkel and chirac preferred european solution in october , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel had backed " a european solution " for european stock markets , a clear signal they favored a merger of euronext and deutsche boerse . francioni said he did not think that a merger between euronext and the nyse was likely to succeed , and said it was " unthinkable " that deutsche börse would try to join in the project . he said the attempt to merge with euronext had cost tens of millions of euros but its failure would not affect his position with deutsche börse . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .
but her small election margin meant she was forced into a difficult partnership with the left-wing social democrats instead . ' adding to political apathy ' now , westerwelle is one of the loudest critics of the current administration , which he blames for failing to bring about a real economic recovery in germany . " the worrying thing about this so-called grand coalition is that it 's contributing to a shocking degree of political apathy , " the 44-year-old politician told reuters on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , ' the grand coalition ' has been a disappointment " we can not allow this grand coalition to lead to the same end as the last one in 1969 , when the far-right npd nearly made it into the federal parliament . " the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- came close to reaching the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the bundestag in 1969 , when germany 's only other post-war " grand coalition " was voted out of office after three difficult years . npd compared to nazis the npd is often compared with hitler 's early nazi party .
it is especially strong in the depressed eastern part of the country .
in september , it took 7.3 percent of the vote in merkel 's home base of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
disillusionment with her coalition was seen as a key reason for the npd 's gains . in the interview , westerwelle attacked merkel 's government for pushing through the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , for failing to reduce non-wage labor costs and for creating more bureaucracy - all moves he said ran counter to the campaign pledges of the governing parties . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .

german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
experts say any additional efforts will only be successful if countries cooperate with the united states . europe needs to strengthen the dialogue with the united states on the future of iraq , according to german president horst köhler . " the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" that would be dumb , short-sighted and arrogant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said sending more troops would n't help the iraqi security situation the failure of us troops in iraq has proven that europe can rule out helping with military manpower . " that is absolutely impossible , " said markus kaim , european and atlantic security expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the key issue is reinstalling iraq 's statehood , as government authority has no meaning in wide parts of the country . " german defense analyst heinz schulte said europe can support measures to secure the post-war environment in iraq . " europeans can play a constructive role in that transitional period between the withdrawal of american and british forces on the one hand and the establishment of a secure and credible iraqi government that has the means to really keep the country together , " schulte said . european support needs to meet iraq 's needs a major task europeans should increasingly contribute to are security issues , schulte said . " without improving the security situation dramatically , there can not be any reconstruction in terms of infrastructure and other things that need to happen , such as education , sewage work and hospitals , " he said , adding that security training needed to be tailored to iraq 's needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german instructors are helping to train iraqi police " one of the criticisms against the german police training , for example , was that it was too european , " schulte said .
" they were training the police to patrol the streets like in a british , french or german suburb and it had nothing to do with the real situation of hard-boiled violence with a lot of arms in iraq . " but european nations could also play a part in other aspects of developing iraq 's statehood , according to kaim . " in order to build up a legitimate state , iraq also needs a tax system with financial income , it needs to develop a viable judicial system , and it needs economic well-being , " kaim said .
" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play . " the key is getting iran on board and europe can help put pressure on iran to use its influence to stop shia attacks , " said graeme herd , international security expert from the geneva center for security policy in switzerland .
" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground . " and if nothing came out of it , european countries can at least say they tried , " kaim addded . europe needs to speak with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler does n't shy away from controversial issues president köhler said it was in europe 's interest to get involved . " we can not allow the region to slide into chaos , " köhler said .
a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .
" but ducking away and just watching is the worse alternative . " now it is up to europe to find a common policy , schulte said . " i think the old question that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger asked , ' if i have a crisis , whom do i call in europe ? ' is still valid , " schulte said .
" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles . " all that will pressure the europeans into a new role that is n't there yet , " schulte said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

fans and team management are worried .
rules or results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says the ranking system is a joke last week , bayern munich vice-chairman karl-heinz rummenigge lashed out at the uefa rankings system , which awards points for wins in both the champions league and the uefa cup .
" i can not accept that romania are a danger to the bundesliga because they collect their points in the uefa cup , " rummennige fumed .
" it 's a joke . "
but others disagree , pointing out that in fact the uefa does award extra points for champions league results .
" the system reflects teams ' performances , " soccer journalist uli hesse-lichtenberger told dw-online .
" and in any case the rules are the same for everyone . "
so what 's caused such a mighty come-down for a league that once dominated european soccer ?
hamburg and other catastrophes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke crashed out of the uefa cup against french side nancy much has been made of hamburg 's failure to earn a single point in this year 's champions league - the worst performance ever by a bundesliga side in that competition .
critics also complain that no german team has won a major european club tournament since 2001 , and that even mighty bayern have fallen out of the uefa top ten . " if you look at the champions league , there 's a clear difference in quality , " reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , told dw-online .
" the only teams we have that can compete at that level are bayern and maybe bremen . " but the bundesliga 's precipitous decline has just as much to do with its perennial also-rans as with its leading lights .
" the teams a bit further back are equally important , " explained hesse-lichtenberger .
" what we need are not necessarily teams winning the champions league , but making the quarterfinals of the uefa cup . " hertha berlin and schalke are already out of that competition after losing to smaller clubs against which they were heavily favored .
that 's put the burden on bundesliga strugglers leverkusen and frankfurt to pick up much-needed points . the money question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams like frankfurt are having to fight for uefa points bundesliga managers never tire of complaining that there 's more money floating around in other leagues - chiefly spain , england and italy - than in the bundesliga .
and there 's some validity to that argument . " we have to accept that we 're going to lose some matches against spanish clubs , " hesse-lichtenberger conceded .
" but at the same time we have to win against belgian or french teams . " getting results against underdogs could become even more important , if french soccer legend michel platini gets his way .
platini , who 's vying to become uefa 's next president , says he 'd like to give smaller leagues , especially in eastern europe , more berths in international competitions - at the expense of the continent 's traditional powerhouses . in any case , german soccer fans have to hope that the few german clubs still alive in international competition pick up enough points to brakes on the league 's perilous slide .
" it 's quite clear , said hesse-lichtenberger , " that we 've got big problems this year . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says the ranking system is a joke last week , bayern munich vice-chairman karl-heinz rummenigge lashed out at the uefa rankings system , which awards points for wins in both the champions league and the uefa cup .
" i can not accept that romania are a danger to the bundesliga because they collect their points in the uefa cup , " rummennige fumed .
" it 's a joke . "
but others disagree , pointing out that in fact the uefa does award extra points for champions league results .
" the system reflects teams ' performances , " soccer journalist uli hesse-lichtenberger told dw-online .
" and in any case the rules are the same for everyone . "

hamburg and other catastrophes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke crashed out of the uefa cup against french side nancy much has been made of hamburg 's failure to earn a single point in this year 's champions league - the worst performance ever by a bundesliga side in that competition .
critics also complain that no german team has won a major european club tournament since 2001 , and that even mighty bayern have fallen out of the uefa top ten . " if you look at the champions league , there 's a clear difference in quality , " reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , told dw-online .
" the only teams we have that can compete at that level are bayern and maybe bremen . " but the bundesliga 's precipitous decline has just as much to do with its perennial also-rans as with its leading lights .
" the teams a bit further back are equally important , " explained hesse-lichtenberger .
" what we need are not necessarily teams winning the champions league , but making the quarterfinals of the uefa cup . " hertha berlin and schalke are already out of that competition after losing to smaller clubs against which they were heavily favored .
that 's put the burden on bundesliga strugglers leverkusen and frankfurt to pick up much-needed points . the money question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams like frankfurt are having to fight for uefa points bundesliga managers never tire of complaining that there 's more money floating around in other leagues - chiefly spain , england and italy - than in the bundesliga .

" but at the same time we have to win against belgian or french teams . " getting results against underdogs could become even more important , if french soccer legend michel platini gets his way .
platini , who 's vying to become uefa 's next president , says he 'd like to give smaller leagues , especially in eastern europe , more berths in international competitions - at the expense of the continent 's traditional powerhouses . in any case , german soccer fans have to hope that the few german clubs still alive in international competition pick up enough points to brakes on the league 's perilous slide .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .

and things are set to get worse . european soccer 's governing body uefa only publishes its league rankings at the end of the season .
but in the latest calculations using the uefa system , the bundesliga only ranks seventh this year - behind romania , england , italy , spain , france , russia and bulgaria .
and that could mean one team fewer in the champions league .
germany is still in fifth place ahead of portugal and romania in uefa 's all-important five-year rankings .
but for the first time less than two points separate the bundesliga from the seventh spot .

in a dw-world.de interview , he talked about reasons for continuing problems between the two countries . born in western galicia in 1945 , krzeminski is one of poland 's leading journalists .
he has worked at the polityka newspaper since 1973 .
in 1993 , he received the goethe medal for his efforts to promote german-polish understanding .
he will receive the viadrina award of the european university viadrina frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday . dw-world.de : german-polish relations are tense at the moment .
in germany , the kaczynski brothers - the polish president and the polish prime minister - are blamed for this .
is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .
polish historians worked on the bonn exhibition " escape , expulsion , integration . "
the debate surrounding a center against expulsions as promoted by the federation of expellees , however , deals with a fundamental question : is it possible to look at various expulsion , deportations and flight movements of the 20th century in a single museum without blurring the lines between perpetrators and victims of a war of aggression ?
a second level of the dispute has to do with past of the federation of expellees that has not been dealt with .
if we disentangle the different layers , a common remembrance is possible . is there a danger that the present cooling of the german-polish relationship will become permanent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viadrina university is located in germany and poland during the past years , we have witnessed what 's almost a miracle of good neighborhood .
despite the cold that 's crept into german-polish relations on the political level , normal contacts continue to exist .
along the border there are dozens of towns that have good relationships .
remember the lifting of visa requirements in 1991 , when the first polish tourists were greeted with bats or the bread roll war of the mid-1990s , when german trade unionists demonstrated against their polish competitors .
today , very little of this negative mood has survived in the border region .

in a dw-world.de interview , he talked about reasons for continuing problems between the two countries . born in western galicia in 1945 , krzeminski is one of poland 's leading journalists .
he has worked at the polityka newspaper since 1973 .
in 1993 , he received the goethe medal for his efforts to promote german-polish understanding .
he will receive the viadrina award of the european university viadrina frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday . dw-world.de : german-polish relations are tense at the moment .
in germany , the kaczynski brothers - the polish president and the polish prime minister - are blamed for this .
is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .

" this concerns us , " schäuble said , adding that the statistic may not mean that violence has increased but that more citizens are reporting domestic violence crimes . perception versus reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the security situation is objectively good , " said zypries schäuble and zypries added that the public 's impression of the frequency of violent crime has been distorted by over-emphasis in the media , particularly in murder and sexual abuse cases involving children . " people think far more of these crimes happen than in reality , " zypries said .
" as awful as the individual cases are , the number is not so large . " in a television interview wednesday with german public broadcaster ard , zypries said that more people in germany feel safe . " the feeling : ' we 're afraid that everything 's just going to get worse ' does n't coincide with the findings in the report , " she added . " it 's a feel-good report " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freiberg called police cutbacks " irresponsible " but konrad freiberg , the head of the federal union of police officers -lrb- gdp -rrb- , responded to the security report with heavy criticism . " it 's a feel-good report that does n't completely represent the reality , " said freiberg wednesday in berlin .
" our perception is different in many respects and i think that the police are closer to reality than many politicians . " freiberg said that , while the number of police officers in germany has dropped from 273,000 to 266,000 in the past five years , violence against officers has increased sharply . he was re-elected tuesday by a 95 percent majority vote as chairman of the police union , which represents 54 percent of germany 's police officers . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jewish leader says right-wing violence recalls 1930s the president of the central council of jews in germany has said that the country was seeing a groundswell of right-wing violence which reminded her of the nazi era .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .
but her small election margin meant she was forced into a difficult partnership with the left-wing social democrats instead . ' adding to political apathy ' now , westerwelle is one of the loudest critics of the current administration , which he blames for failing to bring about a real economic recovery in germany . " the worrying thing about this so-called grand coalition is that it 's contributing to a shocking degree of political apathy , " the 44-year-old politician told reuters on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , ' the grand coalition ' has been a disappointment " we can not allow this grand coalition to lead to the same end as the last one in 1969 , when the far-right npd nearly made it into the federal parliament . " the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- came close to reaching the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the bundestag in 1969 , when germany 's only other post-war " grand coalition " was voted out of office after three difficult years . npd compared to nazis the npd is often compared with hitler 's early nazi party .
it is especially strong in the depressed eastern part of the country .
in september , it took 7.3 percent of the vote in merkel 's home base of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
disillusionment with her coalition was seen as a key reason for the npd 's gains . in the interview , westerwelle attacked merkel 's government for pushing through the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , for failing to reduce non-wage labor costs and for creating more bureaucracy - all moves he said ran counter to the campaign pledges of the governing parties . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .
-lrb- 13.11.2006 -rrb- protesters rally against neo-nazi congress in berlin hundreds of people staged a peaceful rally against a meeting in berlin by the neo-nazi national democratic party , following its gains in recent regional elections , police said .

" it 's a joke . "
but others disagree , pointing out that in fact the uefa does award extra points for champions league results .
" the system reflects teams ' performances , " soccer journalist uli hesse-lichtenberger told dw-online .

" if you look at the champions league , there 's a clear difference in quality , " reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , told dw-online .
" the only teams we have that can compete at that level are bayern and maybe bremen . " but the bundesliga 's precipitous decline has just as much to do with its perennial also-rans as with its leading lights .

" what we need are not necessarily teams winning the champions league , but making the quarterfinals of the uefa cup . " hertha berlin and schalke are already out of that competition after losing to smaller clubs against which they were heavily favored .

and there 's some validity to that argument . " we have to accept that we 're going to lose some matches against spanish clubs , " hesse-lichtenberger conceded .
" but at the same time we have to win against belgian or french teams . " getting results against underdogs could become even more important , if french soccer legend michel platini gets his way .
platini , who 's vying to become uefa 's next president , says he 'd like to give smaller leagues , especially in eastern europe , more berths in international competitions - at the expense of the continent 's traditional powerhouses . in any case , german soccer fans have to hope that the few german clubs still alive in international competition pick up enough points to brakes on the league 's perilous slide .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .

' adding to political apathy ' now , westerwelle is one of the loudest critics of the current administration , which he blames for failing to bring about a real economic recovery in germany . " the worrying thing about this so-called grand coalition is that it 's contributing to a shocking degree of political apathy , " the 44-year-old politician told reuters on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , ' the grand coalition ' has been a disappointment " we can not allow this grand coalition to lead to the same end as the last one in 1969 , when the far-right npd nearly made it into the federal parliament . " the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- came close to reaching the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the bundestag in 1969 , when germany 's only other post-war " grand coalition " was voted out of office after three difficult years . npd compared to nazis the npd is often compared with hitler 's early nazi party .
it is especially strong in the depressed eastern part of the country .
in september , it took 7.3 percent of the vote in merkel 's home base of mecklenburg-western pomerania .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.11.2006 merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the npd attracting voters from the disappointed cdu ranks ?
the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .
but her small election margin meant she was forced into a difficult partnership with the left-wing social democrats instead . ' adding to political apathy ' now , westerwelle is one of the loudest critics of the current administration , which he blames for failing to bring about a real economic recovery in germany . " the worrying thing about this so-called grand coalition is that it 's contributing to a shocking degree of political apathy , " the 44-year-old politician told reuters on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , ' the grand coalition ' has been a disappointment " we can not allow this grand coalition to lead to the same end as the last one in 1969 , when the far-right npd nearly made it into the federal parliament .

german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
experts say any additional efforts will only be successful if countries cooperate with the united states . europe needs to strengthen the dialogue with the united states on the future of iraq , according to german president horst köhler . " the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" that would be dumb , short-sighted and arrogant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said sending more troops would n't help the iraqi security situation the failure of us troops in iraq has proven that europe can rule out helping with military manpower . " that is absolutely impossible , " said markus kaim , european and atlantic security expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the key issue is reinstalling iraq 's statehood , as government authority has no meaning in wide parts of the country . " german defense analyst heinz schulte said europe can support measures to secure the post-war environment in iraq . " europeans can play a constructive role in that transitional period between the withdrawal of american and british forces on the one hand and the establishment of a secure and credible iraqi government that has the means to really keep the country together , " schulte said . european support needs to meet iraq 's needs a major task europeans should increasingly contribute to are security issues , schulte said . " without improving the security situation dramatically , there can not be any reconstruction in terms of infrastructure and other things that need to happen , such as education , sewage work and hospitals , " he said , adding that security training needed to be tailored to iraq 's needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german instructors are helping to train iraqi police " one of the criticisms against the german police training , for example , was that it was too european , " schulte said .
" they were training the police to patrol the streets like in a british , french or german suburb and it had nothing to do with the real situation of hard-boiled violence with a lot of arms in iraq . " but european nations could also play a part in other aspects of developing iraq 's statehood , according to kaim . " in order to build up a legitimate state , iraq also needs a tax system with financial income , it needs to develop a viable judicial system , and it needs economic well-being , " kaim said .
" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play . " the key is getting iran on board and europe can help put pressure on iran to use its influence to stop shia attacks , " said graeme herd , international security expert from the geneva center for security policy in switzerland .
" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground . " and if nothing came out of it , european countries can at least say they tried , " kaim addded . europe needs to speak with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler does n't shy away from controversial issues president köhler said it was in europe 's interest to get involved . " we can not allow the region to slide into chaos , " köhler said .
a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .
" but ducking away and just watching is the worse alternative . " now it is up to europe to find a common policy , schulte said . " i think the old question that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger asked , ' if i have a crisis , whom do i call in europe ? ' is still valid , " schulte said .
" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles . " all that will pressure the europeans into a new role that is n't there yet , " schulte said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
experts say any additional efforts will only be successful if countries cooperate with the united states . europe needs to strengthen the dialogue with the united states on the future of iraq , according to german president horst köhler . " the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" that would be dumb , short-sighted and arrogant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said sending more troops would n't help the iraqi security situation the failure of us troops in iraq has proven that europe can rule out helping with military manpower . " that is absolutely impossible , " said markus kaim , european and atlantic security expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the key issue is reinstalling iraq 's statehood , as government authority has no meaning in wide parts of the country . " german defense analyst heinz schulte said europe can support measures to secure the post-war environment in iraq . " europeans can play a constructive role in that transitional period between the withdrawal of american and british forces on the one hand and the establishment of a secure and credible iraqi government that has the means to really keep the country together , " schulte said . european support needs to meet iraq 's needs a major task europeans should increasingly contribute to are security issues , schulte said . " without improving the security situation dramatically , there can not be any reconstruction in terms of infrastructure and other things that need to happen , such as education , sewage work and hospitals , " he said , adding that security training needed to be tailored to iraq 's needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german instructors are helping to train iraqi police " one of the criticisms against the german police training , for example , was that it was too european , " schulte said .
" they were training the police to patrol the streets like in a british , french or german suburb and it had nothing to do with the real situation of hard-boiled violence with a lot of arms in iraq . " but european nations could also play a part in other aspects of developing iraq 's statehood , according to kaim . " in order to build up a legitimate state , iraq also needs a tax system with financial income , it needs to develop a viable judicial system , and it needs economic well-being , " kaim said .
" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play . " the key is getting iran on board and europe can help put pressure on iran to use its influence to stop shia attacks , " said graeme herd , international security expert from the geneva center for security policy in switzerland .
" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground . " and if nothing came out of it , european countries can at least say they tried , " kaim addded . europe needs to speak with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler does n't shy away from controversial issues president köhler said it was in europe 's interest to get involved . " we can not allow the region to slide into chaos , " köhler said .
a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .
" but ducking away and just watching is the worse alternative . " now it is up to europe to find a common policy , schulte said . " i think the old question that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger asked , ' if i have a crisis , whom do i call in europe ? ' is still valid , " schulte said .
" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles . " all that will pressure the europeans into a new role that is n't there yet , " schulte said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

" the system reflects teams ' performances , " soccer journalist uli hesse-lichtenberger told dw-online .

" what we need are not necessarily teams winning the champions league , but making the quarterfinals of the uefa cup . " hertha berlin and schalke are already out of that competition after losing to smaller clubs against which they were heavily favored .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says the ranking system is a joke last week , bayern munich vice-chairman karl-heinz rummenigge lashed out at the uefa rankings system , which awards points for wins in both the champions league and the uefa cup .
" i can not accept that romania are a danger to the bundesliga because they collect their points in the uefa cup , " rummennige fumed .
" it 's a joke . "
but others disagree , pointing out that in fact the uefa does award extra points for champions league results .
" the system reflects teams ' performances , " soccer journalist uli hesse-lichtenberger told dw-online .
" and in any case the rules are the same for everyone . "

hamburg and other catastrophes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke crashed out of the uefa cup against french side nancy much has been made of hamburg 's failure to earn a single point in this year 's champions league - the worst performance ever by a bundesliga side in that competition .
critics also complain that no german team has won a major european club tournament since 2001 , and that even mighty bayern have fallen out of the uefa top ten . " if you look at the champions league , there 's a clear difference in quality , " reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , told dw-online .
" the only teams we have that can compete at that level are bayern and maybe bremen . " but the bundesliga 's precipitous decline has just as much to do with its perennial also-rans as with its leading lights .
" the teams a bit further back are equally important , " explained hesse-lichtenberger .
" what we need are not necessarily teams winning the champions league , but making the quarterfinals of the uefa cup . " hertha berlin and schalke are already out of that competition after losing to smaller clubs against which they were heavily favored .
that 's put the burden on bundesliga strugglers leverkusen and frankfurt to pick up much-needed points . the money question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams like frankfurt are having to fight for uefa points bundesliga managers never tire of complaining that there 's more money floating around in other leagues - chiefly spain , england and italy - than in the bundesliga .
and there 's some validity to that argument . " we have to accept that we 're going to lose some matches against spanish clubs , " hesse-lichtenberger conceded .
" but at the same time we have to win against belgian or french teams . " getting results against underdogs could become even more important , if french soccer legend michel platini gets his way .
platini , who 's vying to become uefa 's next president , says he 'd like to give smaller leagues , especially in eastern europe , more berths in international competitions - at the expense of the continent 's traditional powerhouses . in any case , german soccer fans have to hope that the few german clubs still alive in international competition pick up enough points to brakes on the league 's perilous slide .

is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .
polish historians worked on the bonn exhibition " escape , expulsion , integration . "
the debate surrounding a center against expulsions as promoted by the federation of expellees , however , deals with a fundamental question : is it possible to look at various expulsion , deportations and flight movements of the 20th century in a single museum without blurring the lines between perpetrators and victims of a war of aggression ?
a second level of the dispute has to do with past of the federation of expellees that has not been dealt with .
if we disentangle the different layers , a common remembrance is possible . is there a danger that the present cooling of the german-polish relationship will become permanent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viadrina university is located in germany and poland during the past years , we have witnessed what 's almost a miracle of good neighborhood .
despite the cold that 's crept into german-polish relations on the political level , normal contacts continue to exist .
along the border there are dozens of towns that have good relationships .
remember the lifting of visa requirements in 1991 , when the first polish tourists were greeted with bats or the bread roll war of the mid-1990s , when german trade unionists demonstrated against their polish competitors .
today , very little of this negative mood has survived in the border region .
we 're really way ahead of the politicians . dennis stute interviewed adam krzeminski -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .
but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? -lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- germany hopes for better ties as polish premier visits berlin following a series of controversies that cloud german-polish relations , poland 's premier visits berlin monday .
relations at the top level remain icy , but young poles seem to have a more positive view of their neighbors .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .
but her small election margin meant she was forced into a difficult partnership with the left-wing social democrats instead . ' adding to political apathy ' now , westerwelle is one of the loudest critics of the current administration , which he blames for failing to bring about a real economic recovery in germany . " the worrying thing about this so-called grand coalition is that it 's contributing to a shocking degree of political apathy , " the 44-year-old politician told reuters on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , ' the grand coalition ' has been a disappointment " we can not allow this grand coalition to lead to the same end as the last one in 1969 , when the far-right npd nearly made it into the federal parliament . " the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- came close to reaching the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the bundestag in 1969 , when germany 's only other post-war " grand coalition " was voted out of office after three difficult years . npd compared to nazis the npd is often compared with hitler 's early nazi party .
it is especially strong in the depressed eastern part of the country .
in september , it took 7.3 percent of the vote in merkel 's home base of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
disillusionment with her coalition was seen as a key reason for the npd 's gains . in the interview , westerwelle attacked merkel 's government for pushing through the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , for failing to reduce non-wage labor costs and for creating more bureaucracy - all moves he said ran counter to the campaign pledges of the governing parties . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .

in a dw-world.de interview , he talked about reasons for continuing problems between the two countries . born in western galicia in 1945 , krzeminski is one of poland 's leading journalists .
he has worked at the polityka newspaper since 1973 .
in 1993 , he received the goethe medal for his efforts to promote german-polish understanding .
he will receive the viadrina award of the european university viadrina frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday . dw-world.de : german-polish relations are tense at the moment .
in germany , the kaczynski brothers - the polish president and the polish prime minister - are blamed for this .
is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .
polish historians worked on the bonn exhibition " escape , expulsion , integration . "
the debate surrounding a center against expulsions as promoted by the federation of expellees , however , deals with a fundamental question : is it possible to look at various expulsion , deportations and flight movements of the 20th century in a single museum without blurring the lines between perpetrators and victims of a war of aggression ?
a second level of the dispute has to do with past of the federation of expellees that has not been dealt with .
if we disentangle the different layers , a common remembrance is possible . is there a danger that the present cooling of the german-polish relationship will become permanent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viadrina university is located in germany and poland during the past years , we have witnessed what 's almost a miracle of good neighborhood .
despite the cold that 's crept into german-polish relations on the political level , normal contacts continue to exist .
along the border there are dozens of towns that have good relationships .
remember the lifting of visa requirements in 1991 , when the first polish tourists were greeted with bats or the bread roll war of the mid-1990s , when german trade unionists demonstrated against their polish competitors .
today , very little of this negative mood has survived in the border region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 15.11.2006 " we 're really way ahead of the politicians " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krzeminski : " i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other " polish journalist adam krzeminski on thursday will be honored for his efforts to improve german-polish relations .
in a dw-world.de interview , he talked about reasons for continuing problems between the two countries . born in western galicia in 1945 , krzeminski is one of poland 's leading journalists .
he has worked at the polityka newspaper since 1973 .
in 1993 , he received the goethe medal for his efforts to promote german-polish understanding .
he will receive the viadrina award of the european university viadrina frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday . dw-world.de : german-polish relations are tense at the moment .
in germany , the kaczynski brothers - the polish president and the polish prime minister - are blamed for this .
is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .
polish historians worked on the bonn exhibition " escape , expulsion , integration . "
the debate surrounding a center against expulsions as promoted by the federation of expellees , however , deals with a fundamental question : is it possible to look at various expulsion , deportations and flight movements of the 20th century in a single museum without blurring the lines between perpetrators and victims of a war of aggression ?
a second level of the dispute has to do with past of the federation of expellees that has not been dealt with .
if we disentangle the different layers , a common remembrance is possible . is there a danger that the present cooling of the german-polish relationship will become permanent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viadrina university is located in germany and poland during the past years , we have witnessed what 's almost a miracle of good neighborhood .
despite the cold that 's crept into german-polish relations on the political level , normal contacts continue to exist .
along the border there are dozens of towns that have good relationships .
remember the lifting of visa requirements in 1991 , when the first polish tourists were greeted with bats or the bread roll war of the mid-1990s , when german trade unionists demonstrated against their polish competitors .
today , very little of this negative mood has survived in the border region .

this is why the eu needs a constitution , which will not only be a legal document , but a charter of basic rights for all eu citizens , she said . merkel was in luxembourg to receive the vision for europe award from the edmond israel foundation , in honor of her service toward " shaping the future of europe . " key to success : economy in order for the eu to work , individuals have to find some " added value " in being european , merkel said in her acceptance speech .
and this can only happen when the european economic model is successful and social programs work , she said . " if the domestic market does n't function , then europe is in danger , " the chancellor said . merkel , who will take over the eu presidency in january , also used the opportunity to make an emphatic plea to slash eu bureaucracy .

the law enters into force in november next year and aims to open up competition in financial markets . " we are responding to the mifid legislation by creating an integrated pan-european trading platform where equities can be traded more cost effectively , " said a spokesman for the venture . the move introduces new competition for the venerable stock market companies in europe which currently dominate stock trading arrangements . euronext chose nyse over deutsche boerse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euronext has agreed to be taken over by nyse instead of deutsche boerse meanwhile , deutsche börse announced wednesday that it was dropping its pursuit of euronext . the german operator had battled to convince its paris-based rival euronext of the logic of a tie-up in the face of a competitive takeover offer from nyse , which was preferred by euronext management . " deutsche börse has decided not to pursue its plans to merge with euronext , " the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange said in a statement . deutsche börse chairman reto francioni told reporters he did not see " any reason " to make new merger offers to euronext in future , but added , " if they want to come to us , however , they are welcome . " insufficient support for merger with dax the company said the decision was taken because it could not agree with euronext on a merger that would suit both parties , and because deutsche börse shareholders did not stand to gain from the takeover . " mergers in our field can only prove successful if they have the support of the management of both parties as well as that of the industry , " said francioni .
" we are convinced that we can not force an unwilling partner to cooperate . " deutsche börse shares plunged following the announcement on euronext , but rallied soon afterwards . in early morning trading , the price of shares in the german group fell 3.56 percent to 86.60 euros .
shares in euronext lost 3.90 percent to 86.30 euros .
a potential takeover of euronext by deutsche börse had enjoyed widespread political support in europe , but euronext , the operator of the paris , amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges , had insisted that it preferred a tie-up with the new york stock exchange . merkel and chirac preferred european solution in october , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel had backed " a european solution " for european stock markets , a clear signal they favored a merger of euronext and deutsche boerse . francioni said he did not think that a merger between euronext and the nyse was likely to succeed , and said it was " unthinkable " that deutsche börse would try to join in the project . he said the attempt to merge with euronext had cost tens of millions of euros but its failure would not affect his position with deutsche börse . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.11.2006 bundesliga continues to slide in international rankings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's fall to earth is just one reason for germany 's poor showing estimates using uefa 's ranking system confirm what most fans already know - the bundesliga is anything but one of the top soccer leagues in europe .
and things are set to get worse . european soccer 's governing body uefa only publishes its league rankings at the end of the season .
but in the latest calculations using the uefa system , the bundesliga only ranks seventh this year - behind romania , england , italy , spain , france , russia and bulgaria .
and that could mean one team fewer in the champions league .
germany is still in fifth place ahead of portugal and romania in uefa 's all-important five-year rankings .
but for the first time less than two points separate the bundesliga from the seventh spot .
if the bundesliga falls a couple more notches , german clubs would only be allocated two - and not the current three - berths in the champions league .
fans and team management are worried .
rules or results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says the ranking system is a joke last week , bayern munich vice-chairman karl-heinz rummenigge lashed out at the uefa rankings system , which awards points for wins in both the champions league and the uefa cup .
" i can not accept that romania are a danger to the bundesliga because they collect their points in the uefa cup , " rummennige fumed .
" it 's a joke . "
but others disagree , pointing out that in fact the uefa does award extra points for champions league results .
" the system reflects teams ' performances , " soccer journalist uli hesse-lichtenberger told dw-online .
" and in any case the rules are the same for everyone . "
so what 's caused such a mighty come-down for a league that once dominated european soccer ?
hamburg and other catastrophes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke crashed out of the uefa cup against french side nancy much has been made of hamburg 's failure to earn a single point in this year 's champions league - the worst performance ever by a bundesliga side in that competition .
critics also complain that no german team has won a major european club tournament since 2001 , and that even mighty bayern have fallen out of the uefa top ten . " if you look at the champions league , there 's a clear difference in quality , " reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , told dw-online .
" the only teams we have that can compete at that level are bayern and maybe bremen . " but the bundesliga 's precipitous decline has just as much to do with its perennial also-rans as with its leading lights .
" the teams a bit further back are equally important , " explained hesse-lichtenberger .
" what we need are not necessarily teams winning the champions league , but making the quarterfinals of the uefa cup . " hertha berlin and schalke are already out of that competition after losing to smaller clubs against which they were heavily favored .
that 's put the burden on bundesliga strugglers leverkusen and frankfurt to pick up much-needed points . the money question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams like frankfurt are having to fight for uefa points bundesliga managers never tire of complaining that there 's more money floating around in other leagues - chiefly spain , england and italy - than in the bundesliga .
and there 's some validity to that argument . " we have to accept that we 're going to lose some matches against spanish clubs , " hesse-lichtenberger conceded .
" but at the same time we have to win against belgian or french teams . " getting results against underdogs could become even more important , if french soccer legend michel platini gets his way .
platini , who 's vying to become uefa 's next president , says he 'd like to give smaller leagues , especially in eastern europe , more berths in international competitions - at the expense of the continent 's traditional powerhouses . in any case , german soccer fans have to hope that the few german clubs still alive in international competition pick up enough points to brakes on the league 's perilous slide .
" it 's quite clear , said hesse-lichtenberger , " that we 've got big problems this year . "

the calculations by the bonn-based environmental group germanwatch took into account emissions levels , emissions trends and climate policy . sweden , britain and denmark topped the rankings .
but , christoph bals , the director of germanwatch , said the current efforts by the top scorers are not enough to effectively curb and reverse global warming .
even sweden is like a one-eyed king among the blind , he said . the united states - the world ’ s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases - ranked at 53 , with only china , malaysia and saudi arabia doing worse . what happens after 2012 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel is in nairobi for the climate change conference the index 's release came as the world 's environment ministers gathered in the kenyan capital nairobi for the decisive phase of the un climate change conference . the ministers are under pressure to develop a framework to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . the german delegation at the conference , which finishes on friday , is led by environment minister sigmar gabriel . germany 's emissions on the rise before leaving for nairobi , gabriel said that based on preliminary data , germany 's carbon dioxide emissions actually rose in 2003 and 2004 .
he said this was due to increases in emissions from power plants and industry , even though they had promised to cut those emissions . " that means we will have to tighten the screws even further , " gabriel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf says germany 's frimmersdorf coal-fired power plant is the second worst climate polluter in europe .
under the kyoto protocol , germany is committed to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 .
much of germany 's initial advances toward the target are due to the collapse of former east germany 's heavily polluting industry . " we 'll have to take tougher measures , " gabriel said .
" despite their requirements to cut co2 emissions , power plants and the industry actually increased those .
evidently , they exported more power or older power plants were used . " " if we do n't reach our targets , then it will be difficult to convince the developing and newly industrialized countries to agree to a post-kyoto protocol , " he said . gabriel also stressed the need to help developing countries adapt to climate change because they were n't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions causing the problems .
the situation in africa " is dramatic " , he said . us wakes up to climate change but gabriel said he saw welcome signals from the united states , even before last week 's elections where the democrats gained control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : californian gov. arnold schwarzenegger introduced the first us cap on greenhouse gases " the political climate in the united states on climate change has improved , " he said .

the law enters into force in november next year and aims to open up competition in financial markets . " we are responding to the mifid legislation by creating an integrated pan-european trading platform where equities can be traded more cost effectively , " said a spokesman for the venture . the move introduces new competition for the venerable stock market companies in europe which currently dominate stock trading arrangements . euronext chose nyse over deutsche boerse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euronext has agreed to be taken over by nyse instead of deutsche boerse meanwhile , deutsche börse announced wednesday that it was dropping its pursuit of euronext . the german operator had battled to convince its paris-based rival euronext of the logic of a tie-up in the face of a competitive takeover offer from nyse , which was preferred by euronext management . " deutsche börse has decided not to pursue its plans to merge with euronext , " the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange said in a statement . deutsche börse chairman reto francioni told reporters he did not see " any reason " to make new merger offers to euronext in future , but added , " if they want to come to us , however , they are welcome . " insufficient support for merger with dax the company said the decision was taken because it could not agree with euronext on a merger that would suit both parties , and because deutsche börse shareholders did not stand to gain from the takeover . " mergers in our field can only prove successful if they have the support of the management of both parties as well as that of the industry , " said francioni .
" we are convinced that we can not force an unwilling partner to cooperate . " deutsche börse shares plunged following the announcement on euronext , but rallied soon afterwards . in early morning trading , the price of shares in the german group fell 3.56 percent to 86.60 euros .
shares in euronext lost 3.90 percent to 86.30 euros .
a potential takeover of euronext by deutsche börse had enjoyed widespread political support in europe , but euronext , the operator of the paris , amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges , had insisted that it preferred a tie-up with the new york stock exchange . merkel and chirac preferred european solution in october , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel had backed " a european solution " for european stock markets , a clear signal they favored a merger of euronext and deutsche boerse . francioni said he did not think that a merger between euronext and the nyse was likely to succeed , and said it was " unthinkable " that deutsche börse would try to join in the project . he said the attempt to merge with euronext had cost tens of millions of euros but its failure would not affect his position with deutsche börse . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

the calculations by the bonn-based environmental group germanwatch took into account emissions levels , emissions trends and climate policy . sweden , britain and denmark topped the rankings .
but , christoph bals , the director of germanwatch , said the current efforts by the top scorers are not enough to effectively curb and reverse global warming .
even sweden is like a one-eyed king among the blind , he said . the united states - the world ’ s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases - ranked at 53 , with only china , malaysia and saudi arabia doing worse . what happens after 2012 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel is in nairobi for the climate change conference the index 's release came as the world 's environment ministers gathered in the kenyan capital nairobi for the decisive phase of the un climate change conference . the ministers are under pressure to develop a framework to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . the german delegation at the conference , which finishes on friday , is led by environment minister sigmar gabriel . germany 's emissions on the rise before leaving for nairobi , gabriel said that based on preliminary data , germany 's carbon dioxide emissions actually rose in 2003 and 2004 .
he said this was due to increases in emissions from power plants and industry , even though they had promised to cut those emissions . " that means we will have to tighten the screws even further , " gabriel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf says germany 's frimmersdorf coal-fired power plant is the second worst climate polluter in europe .
under the kyoto protocol , germany is committed to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 .
much of germany 's initial advances toward the target are due to the collapse of former east germany 's heavily polluting industry . " we 'll have to take tougher measures , " gabriel said .
" despite their requirements to cut co2 emissions , power plants and the industry actually increased those .
evidently , they exported more power or older power plants were used . " " if we do n't reach our targets , then it will be difficult to convince the developing and newly industrialized countries to agree to a post-kyoto protocol , " he said . gabriel also stressed the need to help developing countries adapt to climate change because they were n't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions causing the problems .
the situation in africa " is dramatic " , he said . us wakes up to climate change but gabriel said he saw welcome signals from the united states , even before last week 's elections where the democrats gained control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : californian gov. arnold schwarzenegger introduced the first us cap on greenhouse gases " the political climate in the united states on climate change has improved , " he said .
" it 's interesting that a republican governor , arnold schwarzenegger , bucked the trend and won .
others are now saying ' we have to do more ' . " the us , which produces around a quarter of the world 's greenhouse gases , has refused to sign the kyoto protocol .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .

' adding to political apathy ' now , westerwelle is one of the loudest critics of the current administration , which he blames for failing to bring about a real economic recovery in germany .

" the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- came close to reaching the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the bundestag in 1969 , when germany 's only other post-war " grand coalition " was voted out of office after three difficult years . npd compared to nazis the npd is often compared with hitler 's early nazi party .
it is especially strong in the depressed eastern part of the country .
in september , it took 7.3 percent of the vote in merkel 's home base of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
disillusionment with her coalition was seen as a key reason for the npd 's gains . in the interview , westerwelle attacked merkel 's government for pushing through the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , for failing to reduce non-wage labor costs and for creating more bureaucracy - all moves he said ran counter to the campaign pledges of the governing parties . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .

the calculations by the bonn-based environmental group germanwatch took into account emissions levels , emissions trends and climate policy . sweden , britain and denmark topped the rankings .
but , christoph bals , the director of germanwatch , said the current efforts by the top scorers are not enough to effectively curb and reverse global warming .
even sweden is like a one-eyed king among the blind , he said . the united states - the world ’ s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases - ranked at 53 , with only china , malaysia and saudi arabia doing worse . what happens after 2012 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel is in nairobi for the climate change conference the index 's release came as the world 's environment ministers gathered in the kenyan capital nairobi for the decisive phase of the un climate change conference . the ministers are under pressure to develop a framework to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . the german delegation at the conference , which finishes on friday , is led by environment minister sigmar gabriel . germany 's emissions on the rise before leaving for nairobi , gabriel said that based on preliminary data , germany 's carbon dioxide emissions actually rose in 2003 and 2004 .
he said this was due to increases in emissions from power plants and industry , even though they had promised to cut those emissions . " that means we will have to tighten the screws even further , " gabriel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf says germany 's frimmersdorf coal-fired power plant is the second worst climate polluter in europe .
under the kyoto protocol , germany is committed to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 .
much of germany 's initial advances toward the target are due to the collapse of former east germany 's heavily polluting industry . " we 'll have to take tougher measures , " gabriel said .
" despite their requirements to cut co2 emissions , power plants and the industry actually increased those .
evidently , they exported more power or older power plants were used . " " if we do n't reach our targets , then it will be difficult to convince the developing and newly industrialized countries to agree to a post-kyoto protocol , " he said . gabriel also stressed the need to help developing countries adapt to climate change because they were n't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions causing the problems .
the situation in africa " is dramatic " , he said . us wakes up to climate change but gabriel said he saw welcome signals from the united states , even before last week 's elections where the democrats gained control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : californian gov. arnold schwarzenegger introduced the first us cap on greenhouse gases " the political climate in the united states on climate change has improved , " he said .
" it 's interesting that a republican governor , arnold schwarzenegger , bucked the trend and won .
others are now saying ' we have to do more ' . " the us , which produces around a quarter of the world 's greenhouse gases , has refused to sign the kyoto protocol .

the law enters into force in november next year and aims to open up competition in financial markets . " we are responding to the mifid legislation by creating an integrated pan-european trading platform where equities can be traded more cost effectively , " said a spokesman for the venture . the move introduces new competition for the venerable stock market companies in europe which currently dominate stock trading arrangements . euronext chose nyse over deutsche boerse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euronext has agreed to be taken over by nyse instead of deutsche boerse meanwhile , deutsche börse announced wednesday that it was dropping its pursuit of euronext . the german operator had battled to convince its paris-based rival euronext of the logic of a tie-up in the face of a competitive takeover offer from nyse , which was preferred by euronext management . " deutsche börse has decided not to pursue its plans to merge with euronext , " the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange said in a statement . deutsche börse chairman reto francioni told reporters he did not see " any reason " to make new merger offers to euronext in future , but added , " if they want to come to us , however , they are welcome . " insufficient support for merger with dax the company said the decision was taken because it could not agree with euronext on a merger that would suit both parties , and because deutsche börse shareholders did not stand to gain from the takeover . " mergers in our field can only prove successful if they have the support of the management of both parties as well as that of the industry , " said francioni .
" we are convinced that we can not force an unwilling partner to cooperate . " deutsche börse shares plunged following the announcement on euronext , but rallied soon afterwards . in early morning trading , the price of shares in the german group fell 3.56 percent to 86.60 euros .
shares in euronext lost 3.90 percent to 86.30 euros .
a potential takeover of euronext by deutsche börse had enjoyed widespread political support in europe , but euronext , the operator of the paris , amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges , had insisted that it preferred a tie-up with the new york stock exchange . merkel and chirac preferred european solution in october , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel had backed " a european solution " for european stock markets , a clear signal they favored a merger of euronext and deutsche boerse . francioni said he did not think that a merger between euronext and the nyse was likely to succeed , and said it was " unthinkable " that deutsche börse would try to join in the project . he said the attempt to merge with euronext had cost tens of millions of euros but its failure would not affect his position with deutsche börse . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .
but her small election margin meant she was forced into a difficult partnership with the left-wing social democrats instead . ' adding to political apathy ' now , westerwelle is one of the loudest critics of the current administration , which he blames for failing to bring about a real economic recovery in germany . " the worrying thing about this so-called grand coalition is that it 's contributing to a shocking degree of political apathy , " the 44-year-old politician told reuters on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , ' the grand coalition ' has been a disappointment " we can not allow this grand coalition to lead to the same end as the last one in 1969 , when the far-right npd nearly made it into the federal parliament . " the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- came close to reaching the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the bundestag in 1969 , when germany 's only other post-war " grand coalition " was voted out of office after three difficult years . npd compared to nazis the npd is often compared with hitler 's early nazi party .
it is especially strong in the depressed eastern part of the country .
in september , it took 7.3 percent of the vote in merkel 's home base of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
disillusionment with her coalition was seen as a key reason for the npd 's gains . in the interview , westerwelle attacked merkel 's government for pushing through the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , for failing to reduce non-wage labor costs and for creating more bureaucracy - all moves he said ran counter to the campaign pledges of the governing parties . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .
-lrb- 13.11.2006 -rrb- protesters rally against neo-nazi congress in berlin hundreds of people staged a peaceful rally against a meeting in berlin by the neo-nazi national democratic party , following its gains in recent regional elections , police said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 15.11.2006 " we 're really way ahead of the politicians " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krzeminski : " i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other " polish journalist adam krzeminski on thursday will be honored for his efforts to improve german-polish relations .
in a dw-world.de interview , he talked about reasons for continuing problems between the two countries . born in western galicia in 1945 , krzeminski is one of poland 's leading journalists .
he has worked at the polityka newspaper since 1973 .
in 1993 , he received the goethe medal for his efforts to promote german-polish understanding .
he will receive the viadrina award of the european university viadrina frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday . dw-world.de : german-polish relations are tense at the moment .
in germany , the kaczynski brothers - the polish president and the polish prime minister - are blamed for this .
is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .
polish historians worked on the bonn exhibition " escape , expulsion , integration . "
the debate surrounding a center against expulsions as promoted by the federation of expellees , however , deals with a fundamental question : is it possible to look at various expulsion , deportations and flight movements of the 20th century in a single museum without blurring the lines between perpetrators and victims of a war of aggression ?
a second level of the dispute has to do with past of the federation of expellees that has not been dealt with .
if we disentangle the different layers , a common remembrance is possible . is there a danger that the present cooling of the german-polish relationship will become permanent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viadrina university is located in germany and poland during the past years , we have witnessed what 's almost a miracle of good neighborhood .
despite the cold that 's crept into german-polish relations on the political level , normal contacts continue to exist .
along the border there are dozens of towns that have good relationships .
remember the lifting of visa requirements in 1991 , when the first polish tourists were greeted with bats or the bread roll war of the mid-1990s , when german trade unionists demonstrated against their polish competitors .
today , very little of this negative mood has survived in the border region .

in a dw-world.de interview , he talked about reasons for continuing problems between the two countries . born in western galicia in 1945 , krzeminski is one of poland 's leading journalists .
he has worked at the polityka newspaper since 1973 .
in 1993 , he received the goethe medal for his efforts to promote german-polish understanding .
he will receive the viadrina award of the european university viadrina frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday . dw-world.de : german-polish relations are tense at the moment .
in germany , the kaczynski brothers - the polish president and the polish prime minister - are blamed for this .
is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .
polish historians worked on the bonn exhibition " escape , expulsion , integration . "
the debate surrounding a center against expulsions as promoted by the federation of expellees , however , deals with a fundamental question : is it possible to look at various expulsion , deportations and flight movements of the 20th century in a single museum without blurring the lines between perpetrators and victims of a war of aggression ?
a second level of the dispute has to do with past of the federation of expellees that has not been dealt with .
if we disentangle the different layers , a common remembrance is possible . is there a danger that the present cooling of the german-polish relationship will become permanent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viadrina university is located in germany and poland during the past years , we have witnessed what 's almost a miracle of good neighborhood .
despite the cold that 's crept into german-polish relations on the political level , normal contacts continue to exist .
along the border there are dozens of towns that have good relationships .
remember the lifting of visa requirements in 1991 , when the first polish tourists were greeted with bats or the bread roll war of the mid-1990s , when german trade unionists demonstrated against their polish competitors .

german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
experts say any additional efforts will only be successful if countries cooperate with the united states . europe needs to strengthen the dialogue with the united states on the future of iraq , according to german president horst köhler . " the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" that would be dumb , short-sighted and arrogant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said sending more troops would n't help the iraqi security situation the failure of us troops in iraq has proven that europe can rule out helping with military manpower . " that is absolutely impossible , " said markus kaim , european and atlantic security expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the key issue is reinstalling iraq 's statehood , as government authority has no meaning in wide parts of the country . " german defense analyst heinz schulte said europe can support measures to secure the post-war environment in iraq . " europeans can play a constructive role in that transitional period between the withdrawal of american and british forces on the one hand and the establishment of a secure and credible iraqi government that has the means to really keep the country together , " schulte said . european support needs to meet iraq 's needs a major task europeans should increasingly contribute to are security issues , schulte said . " without improving the security situation dramatically , there can not be any reconstruction in terms of infrastructure and other things that need to happen , such as education , sewage work and hospitals , " he said , adding that security training needed to be tailored to iraq 's needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german instructors are helping to train iraqi police " one of the criticisms against the german police training , for example , was that it was too european , " schulte said .
" they were training the police to patrol the streets like in a british , french or german suburb and it had nothing to do with the real situation of hard-boiled violence with a lot of arms in iraq . " but european nations could also play a part in other aspects of developing iraq 's statehood , according to kaim . " in order to build up a legitimate state , iraq also needs a tax system with financial income , it needs to develop a viable judicial system , and it needs economic well-being , " kaim said .
" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play . " the key is getting iran on board and europe can help put pressure on iran to use its influence to stop shia attacks , " said graeme herd , international security expert from the geneva center for security policy in switzerland .
" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground . " and if nothing came out of it , european countries can at least say they tried , " kaim addded . europe needs to speak with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler does n't shy away from controversial issues president köhler said it was in europe 's interest to get involved . " we can not allow the region to slide into chaos , " köhler said .
a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .
" but ducking away and just watching is the worse alternative . " now it is up to europe to find a common policy , schulte said . " i think the old question that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger asked , ' if i have a crisis , whom do i call in europe ? ' is still valid , " schulte said .
" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles . " all that will pressure the europeans into a new role that is n't there yet , " schulte said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
experts say any additional efforts will only be successful if countries cooperate with the united states . europe needs to strengthen the dialogue with the united states on the future of iraq , according to german president horst köhler . " the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" that would be dumb , short-sighted and arrogant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said sending more troops would n't help the iraqi security situation the failure of us troops in iraq has proven that europe can rule out helping with military manpower . " that is absolutely impossible , " said markus kaim , european and atlantic security expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the key issue is reinstalling iraq 's statehood , as government authority has no meaning in wide parts of the country . " german defense analyst heinz schulte said europe can support measures to secure the post-war environment in iraq . " europeans can play a constructive role in that transitional period between the withdrawal of american and british forces on the one hand and the establishment of a secure and credible iraqi government that has the means to really keep the country together , " schulte said . european support needs to meet iraq 's needs a major task europeans should increasingly contribute to are security issues , schulte said . " without improving the security situation dramatically , there can not be any reconstruction in terms of infrastructure and other things that need to happen , such as education , sewage work and hospitals , " he said , adding that security training needed to be tailored to iraq 's needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german instructors are helping to train iraqi police " one of the criticisms against the german police training , for example , was that it was too european , " schulte said .
" they were training the police to patrol the streets like in a british , french or german suburb and it had nothing to do with the real situation of hard-boiled violence with a lot of arms in iraq . " but european nations could also play a part in other aspects of developing iraq 's statehood , according to kaim . " in order to build up a legitimate state , iraq also needs a tax system with financial income , it needs to develop a viable judicial system , and it needs economic well-being , " kaim said .
" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play .

" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .

and things are set to get worse . european soccer 's governing body uefa only publishes its league rankings at the end of the season .
but in the latest calculations using the uefa system , the bundesliga only ranks seventh this year - behind romania , england , italy , spain , france , russia and bulgaria .
and that could mean one team fewer in the champions league .
germany is still in fifth place ahead of portugal and romania in uefa 's all-important five-year rankings .
but for the first time less than two points separate the bundesliga from the seventh spot .
if the bundesliga falls a couple more notches , german clubs would only be allocated two - and not the current three - berths in the champions league .
fans and team management are worried .
rules or results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says the ranking system is a joke last week , bayern munich vice-chairman karl-heinz rummenigge lashed out at the uefa rankings system , which awards points for wins in both the champions league and the uefa cup .
" i can not accept that romania are a danger to the bundesliga because they collect their points in the uefa cup , " rummennige fumed .
" it 's a joke . "
but others disagree , pointing out that in fact the uefa does award extra points for champions league results .
" the system reflects teams ' performances , " soccer journalist uli hesse-lichtenberger told dw-online .
" and in any case the rules are the same for everyone . "
so what 's caused such a mighty come-down for a league that once dominated european soccer ?
hamburg and other catastrophes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke crashed out of the uefa cup against french side nancy much has been made of hamburg 's failure to earn a single point in this year 's champions league - the worst performance ever by a bundesliga side in that competition .
critics also complain that no german team has won a major european club tournament since 2001 , and that even mighty bayern have fallen out of the uefa top ten . " if you look at the champions league , there 's a clear difference in quality , " reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , told dw-online .
" the only teams we have that can compete at that level are bayern and maybe bremen . " but the bundesliga 's precipitous decline has just as much to do with its perennial also-rans as with its leading lights .
" the teams a bit further back are equally important , " explained hesse-lichtenberger .
" what we need are not necessarily teams winning the champions league , but making the quarterfinals of the uefa cup . " hertha berlin and schalke are already out of that competition after losing to smaller clubs against which they were heavily favored .
that 's put the burden on bundesliga strugglers leverkusen and frankfurt to pick up much-needed points . the money question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams like frankfurt are having to fight for uefa points bundesliga managers never tire of complaining that there 's more money floating around in other leagues - chiefly spain , england and italy - than in the bundesliga .
and there 's some validity to that argument . " we have to accept that we 're going to lose some matches against spanish clubs , " hesse-lichtenberger conceded .
" but at the same time we have to win against belgian or french teams . " getting results against underdogs could become even more important , if french soccer legend michel platini gets his way .
platini , who 's vying to become uefa 's next president , says he 'd like to give smaller leagues , especially in eastern europe , more berths in international competitions - at the expense of the continent 's traditional powerhouses . in any case , german soccer fans have to hope that the few german clubs still alive in international competition pick up enough points to brakes on the league 's perilous slide .
" it 's quite clear , said hesse-lichtenberger , " that we 've got big problems this year . "
the league that once ruled the roost is in danger is of tumbling down the ladder . . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg caught out cold in european competition what was supposed to a cracker and a hot fight for victory on a cold night turned into humiliation in the form of a 3-1 home defeat for hamburg against cool portuguese champions porto in the european champions league .

none of the teams expected to contend for the title have been able to put their stamp on this season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.11.2006 bundesliga continues to slide in international rankings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's fall to earth is just one reason for germany 's poor showing estimates using uefa 's ranking system confirm what most fans already know - the bundesliga is anything but one of the top soccer leagues in europe .
and things are set to get worse . european soccer 's governing body uefa only publishes its league rankings at the end of the season .
but in the latest calculations using the uefa system , the bundesliga only ranks seventh this year - behind romania , england , italy , spain , france , russia and bulgaria .
and that could mean one team fewer in the champions league .
germany is still in fifth place ahead of portugal and romania in uefa 's all-important five-year rankings .
but for the first time less than two points separate the bundesliga from the seventh spot .
if the bundesliga falls a couple more notches , german clubs would only be allocated two - and not the current three - berths in the champions league .
fans and team management are worried .
rules or results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says the ranking system is a joke last week , bayern munich vice-chairman karl-heinz rummenigge lashed out at the uefa rankings system , which awards points for wins in both the champions league and the uefa cup .
" i can not accept that romania are a danger to the bundesliga because they collect their points in the uefa cup , " rummennige fumed .
" it 's a joke . "
but others disagree , pointing out that in fact the uefa does award extra points for champions league results .
" the system reflects teams ' performances , " soccer journalist uli hesse-lichtenberger told dw-online .
" and in any case the rules are the same for everyone . "
so what 's caused such a mighty come-down for a league that once dominated european soccer ?
hamburg and other catastrophes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke crashed out of the uefa cup against french side nancy much has been made of hamburg 's failure to earn a single point in this year 's champions league - the worst performance ever by a bundesliga side in that competition .
critics also complain that no german team has won a major european club tournament since 2001 , and that even mighty bayern have fallen out of the uefa top ten . " if you look at the champions league , there 's a clear difference in quality , " reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , told dw-online .
" the only teams we have that can compete at that level are bayern and maybe bremen . " but the bundesliga 's precipitous decline has just as much to do with its perennial also-rans as with its leading lights .
" the teams a bit further back are equally important , " explained hesse-lichtenberger .
" what we need are not necessarily teams winning the champions league , but making the quarterfinals of the uefa cup . " hertha berlin and schalke are already out of that competition after losing to smaller clubs against which they were heavily favored .
that 's put the burden on bundesliga strugglers leverkusen and frankfurt to pick up much-needed points . the money question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams like frankfurt are having to fight for uefa points bundesliga managers never tire of complaining that there 's more money floating around in other leagues - chiefly spain , england and italy - than in the bundesliga .
and there 's some validity to that argument . " we have to accept that we 're going to lose some matches against spanish clubs , " hesse-lichtenberger conceded .
" but at the same time we have to win against belgian or french teams . " getting results against underdogs could become even more important , if french soccer legend michel platini gets his way .
platini , who 's vying to become uefa 's next president , says he 'd like to give smaller leagues , especially in eastern europe , more berths in international competitions - at the expense of the continent 's traditional powerhouses . in any case , german soccer fans have to hope that the few german clubs still alive in international competition pick up enough points to brakes on the league 's perilous slide .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .
but her small election margin meant she was forced into a difficult partnership with the left-wing social democrats instead . ' adding to political apathy ' now , westerwelle is one of the loudest critics of the current administration , which he blames for failing to bring about a real economic recovery in germany . " the worrying thing about this so-called grand coalition is that it 's contributing to a shocking degree of political apathy , " the 44-year-old politician told reuters on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , ' the grand coalition ' has been a disappointment " we can not allow this grand coalition to lead to the same end as the last one in 1969 , when the far-right npd nearly made it into the federal parliament .

it is especially strong in the depressed eastern part of the country .
in september , it took 7.3 percent of the vote in merkel 's home base of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
disillusionment with her coalition was seen as a key reason for the npd 's gains . in the interview , westerwelle attacked merkel 's government for pushing through the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , for failing to reduce non-wage labor costs and for creating more bureaucracy - all moves he said ran counter to the campaign pledges of the governing parties . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .
but her small election margin meant she was forced into a difficult partnership with the left-wing social democrats instead . ' adding to political apathy ' now , westerwelle is one of the loudest critics of the current administration , which he blames for failing to bring about a real economic recovery in germany . " the worrying thing about this so-called grand coalition is that it 's contributing to a shocking degree of political apathy , " the 44-year-old politician told reuters on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , ' the grand coalition ' has been a disappointment " we can not allow this grand coalition to lead to the same end as the last one in 1969 , when the far-right npd nearly made it into the federal parliament . " the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- came close to reaching the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the bundestag in 1969 , when germany 's only other post-war " grand coalition " was voted out of office after three difficult years . npd compared to nazis the npd is often compared with hitler 's early nazi party .
it is especially strong in the depressed eastern part of the country .
in september , it took 7.3 percent of the vote in merkel 's home base of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
disillusionment with her coalition was seen as a key reason for the npd 's gains . in the interview , westerwelle attacked merkel 's government for pushing through the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , for failing to reduce non-wage labor costs and for creating more bureaucracy - all moves he said ran counter to the campaign pledges of the governing parties . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .
-lrb- 13.11.2006 -rrb- protesters rally against neo-nazi congress in berlin hundreds of people staged a peaceful rally against a meeting in berlin by the neo-nazi national democratic party , following its gains in recent regional elections , police said .

in a dw-world.de interview , he talked about reasons for continuing problems between the two countries . born in western galicia in 1945 , krzeminski is one of poland 's leading journalists .
he has worked at the polityka newspaper since 1973 .
in 1993 , he received the goethe medal for his efforts to promote german-polish understanding .
he will receive the viadrina award of the european university viadrina frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday . dw-world.de : german-polish relations are tense at the moment .
in germany , the kaczynski brothers - the polish president and the polish prime minister - are blamed for this .
is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .
polish historians worked on the bonn exhibition " escape , expulsion , integration . "
the debate surrounding a center against expulsions as promoted by the federation of expellees , however , deals with a fundamental question : is it possible to look at various expulsion , deportations and flight movements of the 20th century in a single museum without blurring the lines between perpetrators and victims of a war of aggression ?
a second level of the dispute has to do with past of the federation of expellees that has not been dealt with .
if we disentangle the different layers , a common remembrance is possible . is there a danger that the present cooling of the german-polish relationship will become permanent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viadrina university is located in germany and poland during the past years , we have witnessed what 's almost a miracle of good neighborhood .
despite the cold that 's crept into german-polish relations on the political level , normal contacts continue to exist .
along the border there are dozens of towns that have good relationships .
remember the lifting of visa requirements in 1991 , when the first polish tourists were greeted with bats or the bread roll war of the mid-1990s , when german trade unionists demonstrated against their polish competitors .
today , very little of this negative mood has survived in the border region .
we 're really way ahead of the politicians . dennis stute interviewed adam krzeminski -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .

in a dw-world.de interview , he talked about reasons for continuing problems between the two countries . born in western galicia in 1945 , krzeminski is one of poland 's leading journalists .
he has worked at the polityka newspaper since 1973 .
in 1993 , he received the goethe medal for his efforts to promote german-polish understanding .
he will receive the viadrina award of the european university viadrina frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday . dw-world.de : german-polish relations are tense at the moment .
in germany , the kaczynski brothers - the polish president and the polish prime minister - are blamed for this .
is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .
polish historians worked on the bonn exhibition " escape , expulsion , integration . "
the debate surrounding a center against expulsions as promoted by the federation of expellees , however , deals with a fundamental question : is it possible to look at various expulsion , deportations and flight movements of the 20th century in a single museum without blurring the lines between perpetrators and victims of a war of aggression ?
a second level of the dispute has to do with past of the federation of expellees that has not been dealt with .
if we disentangle the different layers , a common remembrance is possible . is there a danger that the present cooling of the german-polish relationship will become permanent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viadrina university is located in germany and poland during the past years , we have witnessed what 's almost a miracle of good neighborhood .
despite the cold that 's crept into german-polish relations on the political level , normal contacts continue to exist .
along the border there are dozens of towns that have good relationships .
remember the lifting of visa requirements in 1991 , when the first polish tourists were greeted with bats or the bread roll war of the mid-1990s , when german trade unionists demonstrated against their polish competitors .
today , very little of this negative mood has survived in the border region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 15.11.2006 german leader calls for more active european role in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can europe do more to help rebuild iraq ?
german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
experts say any additional efforts will only be successful if countries cooperate with the united states . europe needs to strengthen the dialogue with the united states on the future of iraq , according to german president horst köhler . " the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" that would be dumb , short-sighted and arrogant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said sending more troops would n't help the iraqi security situation the failure of us troops in iraq has proven that europe can rule out helping with military manpower . " that is absolutely impossible , " said markus kaim , european and atlantic security expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the key issue is reinstalling iraq 's statehood , as government authority has no meaning in wide parts of the country . " german defense analyst heinz schulte said europe can support measures to secure the post-war environment in iraq . " europeans can play a constructive role in that transitional period between the withdrawal of american and british forces on the one hand and the establishment of a secure and credible iraqi government that has the means to really keep the country together , " schulte said . european support needs to meet iraq 's needs a major task europeans should increasingly contribute to are security issues , schulte said . " without improving the security situation dramatically , there can not be any reconstruction in terms of infrastructure and other things that need to happen , such as education , sewage work and hospitals , " he said , adding that security training needed to be tailored to iraq 's needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german instructors are helping to train iraqi police " one of the criticisms against the german police training , for example , was that it was too european , " schulte said .
" they were training the police to patrol the streets like in a british , french or german suburb and it had nothing to do with the real situation of hard-boiled violence with a lot of arms in iraq . " but european nations could also play a part in other aspects of developing iraq 's statehood , according to kaim . " in order to build up a legitimate state , iraq also needs a tax system with financial income , it needs to develop a viable judicial system , and it needs economic well-being , " kaim said .
" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play . " the key is getting iran on board and europe can help put pressure on iran to use its influence to stop shia attacks , " said graeme herd , international security expert from the geneva center for security policy in switzerland .
" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground . " and if nothing came out of it , european countries can at least say they tried , " kaim addded . europe needs to speak with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler does n't shy away from controversial issues president köhler said it was in europe 's interest to get involved . " we can not allow the region to slide into chaos , " köhler said .
a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .
" but ducking away and just watching is the worse alternative . " now it is up to europe to find a common policy , schulte said . " i think the old question that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger asked , ' if i have a crisis , whom do i call in europe ? ' is still valid , " schulte said .
" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles . " all that will pressure the europeans into a new role that is n't there yet , " schulte said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
experts say any additional efforts will only be successful if countries cooperate with the united states . europe needs to strengthen the dialogue with the united states on the future of iraq , according to german president horst köhler . " the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" that would be dumb , short-sighted and arrogant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said sending more troops would n't help the iraqi security situation the failure of us troops in iraq has proven that europe can rule out helping with military manpower . " that is absolutely impossible , " said markus kaim , european and atlantic security expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the key issue is reinstalling iraq 's statehood , as government authority has no meaning in wide parts of the country . " german defense analyst heinz schulte said europe can support measures to secure the post-war environment in iraq . " europeans can play a constructive role in that transitional period between the withdrawal of american and british forces on the one hand and the establishment of a secure and credible iraqi government that has the means to really keep the country together , " schulte said . european support needs to meet iraq 's needs a major task europeans should increasingly contribute to are security issues , schulte said . " without improving the security situation dramatically , there can not be any reconstruction in terms of infrastructure and other things that need to happen , such as education , sewage work and hospitals , " he said , adding that security training needed to be tailored to iraq 's needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german instructors are helping to train iraqi police " one of the criticisms against the german police training , for example , was that it was too european , " schulte said .
" they were training the police to patrol the streets like in a british , french or german suburb and it had nothing to do with the real situation of hard-boiled violence with a lot of arms in iraq . " but european nations could also play a part in other aspects of developing iraq 's statehood , according to kaim . " in order to build up a legitimate state , iraq also needs a tax system with financial income , it needs to develop a viable judicial system , and it needs economic well-being , " kaim said .
" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play . " the key is getting iran on board and europe can help put pressure on iran to use its influence to stop shia attacks , " said graeme herd , international security expert from the geneva center for security policy in switzerland .
" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground . " and if nothing came out of it , european countries can at least say they tried , " kaim addded . europe needs to speak with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler does n't shy away from controversial issues president köhler said it was in europe 's interest to get involved . " we can not allow the region to slide into chaos , " köhler said .
a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .
" but ducking away and just watching is the worse alternative . " now it is up to europe to find a common policy , schulte said . " i think the old question that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger asked , ' if i have a crisis , whom do i call in europe ? ' is still valid , " schulte said .
" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles . " all that will pressure the europeans into a new role that is n't there yet , " schulte said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

" without improving the security situation dramatically , there can not be any reconstruction in terms of infrastructure and other things that need to happen , such as education , sewage work and hospitals , " he said , adding that security training needed to be tailored to iraq 's needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german instructors are helping to train iraqi police " one of the criticisms against the german police training , for example , was that it was too european , " schulte said .
" they were training the police to patrol the streets like in a british , french or german suburb and it had nothing to do with the real situation of hard-boiled violence with a lot of arms in iraq . " but european nations could also play a part in other aspects of developing iraq 's statehood , according to kaim . " in order to build up a legitimate state , iraq also needs a tax system with financial income , it needs to develop a viable judicial system , and it needs economic well-being , " kaim said .
" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play . " the key is getting iran on board and europe can help put pressure on iran to use its influence to stop shia attacks , " said graeme herd , international security expert from the geneva center for security policy in switzerland .
" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground . " and if nothing came out of it , european countries can at least say they tried , " kaim addded . europe needs to speak with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler does n't shy away from controversial issues president köhler said it was in europe 's interest to get involved . " we can not allow the region to slide into chaos , " köhler said .
a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .
" but ducking away and just watching is the worse alternative . " now it is up to europe to find a common policy , schulte said . " i think the old question that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger asked , ' if i have a crisis , whom do i call in europe ? ' is still valid , " schulte said .
" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles . " all that will pressure the europeans into a new role that is n't there yet , " schulte said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .
but her small election margin meant she was forced into a difficult partnership with the left-wing social democrats instead . ' adding to political apathy ' now , westerwelle is one of the loudest critics of the current administration , which he blames for failing to bring about a real economic recovery in germany . " the worrying thing about this so-called grand coalition is that it 's contributing to a shocking degree of political apathy , " the 44-year-old politician told reuters on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , ' the grand coalition ' has been a disappointment " we can not allow this grand coalition to lead to the same end as the last one in 1969 , when the far-right npd nearly made it into the federal parliament . " the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- came close to reaching the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the bundestag in 1969 , when germany 's only other post-war " grand coalition " was voted out of office after three difficult years . npd compared to nazis the npd is often compared with hitler 's early nazi party .
it is especially strong in the depressed eastern part of the country .
in september , it took 7.3 percent of the vote in merkel 's home base of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
disillusionment with her coalition was seen as a key reason for the npd 's gains . in the interview , westerwelle attacked merkel 's government for pushing through the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , for failing to reduce non-wage labor costs and for creating more bureaucracy - all moves he said ran counter to the campaign pledges of the governing parties . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .

" this concerns us , " schäuble said , adding that the statistic may not mean that violence has increased but that more citizens are reporting domestic violence crimes . perception versus reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the security situation is objectively good , " said zypries schäuble and zypries added that the public 's impression of the frequency of violent crime has been distorted by over-emphasis in the media , particularly in murder and sexual abuse cases involving children .

" as awful as the individual cases are , the number is not so large . " in a television interview wednesday with german public broadcaster ard , zypries said that more people in germany feel safe .

" our perception is different in many respects and i think that the police are closer to reality than many politicians . " freiberg said that , while the number of police officers in germany has dropped from 273,000 to 266,000 in the past five years , violence against officers has increased sharply . he was re-elected tuesday by a 95 percent majority vote as chairman of the police union , which represents 54 percent of germany 's police officers . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jewish leader says right-wing violence recalls 1930s the president of the central council of jews in germany has said that the country was seeing a groundswell of right-wing violence which reminded her of the nazi era .

the law enters into force in november next year and aims to open up competition in financial markets . " we are responding to the mifid legislation by creating an integrated pan-european trading platform where equities can be traded more cost effectively , " said a spokesman for the venture . the move introduces new competition for the venerable stock market companies in europe which currently dominate stock trading arrangements . euronext chose nyse over deutsche boerse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euronext has agreed to be taken over by nyse instead of deutsche boerse meanwhile , deutsche börse announced wednesday that it was dropping its pursuit of euronext . the german operator had battled to convince its paris-based rival euronext of the logic of a tie-up in the face of a competitive takeover offer from nyse , which was preferred by euronext management . " deutsche börse has decided not to pursue its plans to merge with euronext , " the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange said in a statement . deutsche börse chairman reto francioni told reporters he did not see " any reason " to make new merger offers to euronext in future , but added , " if they want to come to us , however , they are welcome . " insufficient support for merger with dax the company said the decision was taken because it could not agree with euronext on a merger that would suit both parties , and because deutsche börse shareholders did not stand to gain from the takeover . " mergers in our field can only prove successful if they have the support of the management of both parties as well as that of the industry , " said francioni .
" we are convinced that we can not force an unwilling partner to cooperate . " deutsche börse shares plunged following the announcement on euronext , but rallied soon afterwards . in early morning trading , the price of shares in the german group fell 3.56 percent to 86.60 euros .
shares in euronext lost 3.90 percent to 86.30 euros .
a potential takeover of euronext by deutsche börse had enjoyed widespread political support in europe , but euronext , the operator of the paris , amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges , had insisted that it preferred a tie-up with the new york stock exchange . merkel and chirac preferred european solution in october , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel had backed " a european solution " for european stock markets , a clear signal they favored a merger of euronext and deutsche boerse . francioni said he did not think that a merger between euronext and the nyse was likely to succeed , and said it was " unthinkable " that deutsche börse would try to join in the project . he said the attempt to merge with euronext had cost tens of millions of euros but its failure would not affect his position with deutsche börse . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

" we are convinced that we can not force an unwilling partner to cooperate . " deutsche börse shares plunged following the announcement on euronext , but rallied soon afterwards . in early morning trading , the price of shares in the german group fell 3.56 percent to 86.60 euros .
shares in euronext lost 3.90 percent to 86.30 euros .
a potential takeover of euronext by deutsche börse had enjoyed widespread political support in europe , but euronext , the operator of the paris , amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges , had insisted that it preferred a tie-up with the new york stock exchange . merkel and chirac preferred european solution in october , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor angela merkel had backed " a european solution " for european stock markets , a clear signal they favored a merger of euronext and deutsche boerse . francioni said he did not think that a merger between euronext and the nyse was likely to succeed , and said it was " unthinkable " that deutsche börse would try to join in the project . he said the attempt to merge with euronext had cost tens of millions of euros but its failure would not affect his position with deutsche börse . dw staff / afp -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bank chief pleads innocence at mannesmann retrial deutsche bank chief josef ackermann asserted his innocence again thursday in a retrial of the long-running mannesmann case which could cost him his job as head of the biggest german bank .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .
but her small election margin meant she was forced into a difficult partnership with the left-wing social democrats instead . ' adding to political apathy ' now , westerwelle is one of the loudest critics of the current administration , which he blames for failing to bring about a real economic recovery in germany . " the worrying thing about this so-called grand coalition is that it 's contributing to a shocking degree of political apathy , " the 44-year-old politician told reuters on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , ' the grand coalition ' has been a disappointment " we can not allow this grand coalition to lead to the same end as the last one in 1969 , when the far-right npd nearly made it into the federal parliament . " the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- came close to reaching the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the bundestag in 1969 , when germany 's only other post-war " grand coalition " was voted out of office after three difficult years . npd compared to nazis the npd is often compared with hitler 's early nazi party .
it is especially strong in the depressed eastern part of the country .
in september , it took 7.3 percent of the vote in merkel 's home base of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
disillusionment with her coalition was seen as a key reason for the npd 's gains . in the interview , westerwelle attacked merkel 's government for pushing through the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , for failing to reduce non-wage labor costs and for creating more bureaucracy - all moves he said ran counter to the campaign pledges of the governing parties . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .

disillusionment with her coalition was seen as a key reason for the npd 's gains . in the interview , westerwelle attacked merkel 's government for pushing through the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , for failing to reduce non-wage labor costs and for creating more bureaucracy - all moves he said ran counter to the campaign pledges of the governing parties . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .
but her small election margin meant she was forced into a difficult partnership with the left-wing social democrats instead . ' adding to political apathy ' now , westerwelle is one of the loudest critics of the current administration , which he blames for failing to bring about a real economic recovery in germany . " the worrying thing about this so-called grand coalition is that it 's contributing to a shocking degree of political apathy , " the 44-year-old politician told reuters on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , ' the grand coalition ' has been a disappointment " we can not allow this grand coalition to lead to the same end as the last one in 1969 , when the far-right npd nearly made it into the federal parliament . " the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- came close to reaching the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the bundestag in 1969 , when germany 's only other post-war " grand coalition " was voted out of office after three difficult years . npd compared to nazis the npd is often compared with hitler 's early nazi party .
it is especially strong in the depressed eastern part of the country .
in september , it took 7.3 percent of the vote in merkel 's home base of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
disillusionment with her coalition was seen as a key reason for the npd 's gains . in the interview , westerwelle attacked merkel 's government for pushing through the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , for failing to reduce non-wage labor costs and for creating more bureaucracy - all moves he said ran counter to the campaign pledges of the governing parties . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .
-lrb- 13.11.2006 -rrb- protesters rally against neo-nazi congress in berlin hundreds of people staged a peaceful rally against a meeting in berlin by the neo-nazi national democratic party , following its gains in recent regional elections , police said .

and things are set to get worse . european soccer 's governing body uefa only publishes its league rankings at the end of the season .
but in the latest calculations using the uefa system , the bundesliga only ranks seventh this year - behind romania , england , italy , spain , france , russia and bulgaria .

germany is still in fifth place ahead of portugal and romania in uefa 's all-important five-year rankings .
but for the first time less than two points separate the bundesliga from the seventh spot .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says the ranking system is a joke last week , bayern munich vice-chairman karl-heinz rummenigge lashed out at the uefa rankings system , which awards points for wins in both the champions league and the uefa cup .
" i can not accept that romania are a danger to the bundesliga because they collect their points in the uefa cup , " rummennige fumed .
" it 's a joke . "
but others disagree , pointing out that in fact the uefa does award extra points for champions league results .
" the system reflects teams ' performances , " soccer journalist uli hesse-lichtenberger told dw-online .
" and in any case the rules are the same for everyone . "
so what 's caused such a mighty come-down for a league that once dominated european soccer ?
hamburg and other catastrophes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke crashed out of the uefa cup against french side nancy much has been made of hamburg 's failure to earn a single point in this year 's champions league - the worst performance ever by a bundesliga side in that competition .
critics also complain that no german team has won a major european club tournament since 2001 , and that even mighty bayern have fallen out of the uefa top ten . " if you look at the champions league , there 's a clear difference in quality , " reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , told dw-online .
" the only teams we have that can compete at that level are bayern and maybe bremen . " but the bundesliga 's precipitous decline has just as much to do with its perennial also-rans as with its leading lights .
" the teams a bit further back are equally important , " explained hesse-lichtenberger .
" what we need are not necessarily teams winning the champions league , but making the quarterfinals of the uefa cup . " hertha berlin and schalke are already out of that competition after losing to smaller clubs against which they were heavily favored .
that 's put the burden on bundesliga strugglers leverkusen and frankfurt to pick up much-needed points . the money question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams like frankfurt are having to fight for uefa points bundesliga managers never tire of complaining that there 's more money floating around in other leagues - chiefly spain , england and italy - than in the bundesliga .
and there 's some validity to that argument . " we have to accept that we 're going to lose some matches against spanish clubs , " hesse-lichtenberger conceded .
" but at the same time we have to win against belgian or french teams . " getting results against underdogs could become even more important , if french soccer legend michel platini gets his way .
platini , who 's vying to become uefa 's next president , says he 'd like to give smaller leagues , especially in eastern europe , more berths in international competitions - at the expense of the continent 's traditional powerhouses . in any case , german soccer fans have to hope that the few german clubs still alive in international competition pick up enough points to brakes on the league 's perilous slide .

and things are set to get worse . european soccer 's governing body uefa only publishes its league rankings at the end of the season .
but in the latest calculations using the uefa system , the bundesliga only ranks seventh this year - behind romania , england , italy , spain , france , russia and bulgaria .
and that could mean one team fewer in the champions league .
germany is still in fifth place ahead of portugal and romania in uefa 's all-important five-year rankings .
but for the first time less than two points separate the bundesliga from the seventh spot .
if the bundesliga falls a couple more notches , german clubs would only be allocated two - and not the current three - berths in the champions league .
fans and team management are worried .
rules or results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says the ranking system is a joke last week , bayern munich vice-chairman karl-heinz rummenigge lashed out at the uefa rankings system , which awards points for wins in both the champions league and the uefa cup .
" i can not accept that romania are a danger to the bundesliga because they collect their points in the uefa cup , " rummennige fumed .
" it 's a joke . "
but others disagree , pointing out that in fact the uefa does award extra points for champions league results .
" the system reflects teams ' performances , " soccer journalist uli hesse-lichtenberger told dw-online .
" and in any case the rules are the same for everyone . "
so what 's caused such a mighty come-down for a league that once dominated european soccer ?
hamburg and other catastrophes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke crashed out of the uefa cup against french side nancy much has been made of hamburg 's failure to earn a single point in this year 's champions league - the worst performance ever by a bundesliga side in that competition .
critics also complain that no german team has won a major european club tournament since 2001 , and that even mighty bayern have fallen out of the uefa top ten . " if you look at the champions league , there 's a clear difference in quality , " reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , told dw-online .

german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
experts say any additional efforts will only be successful if countries cooperate with the united states . europe needs to strengthen the dialogue with the united states on the future of iraq , according to german president horst köhler . " the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" that would be dumb , short-sighted and arrogant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said sending more troops would n't help the iraqi security situation the failure of us troops in iraq has proven that europe can rule out helping with military manpower . " that is absolutely impossible , " said markus kaim , european and atlantic security expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the key issue is reinstalling iraq 's statehood , as government authority has no meaning in wide parts of the country . " german defense analyst heinz schulte said europe can support measures to secure the post-war environment in iraq . " europeans can play a constructive role in that transitional period between the withdrawal of american and british forces on the one hand and the establishment of a secure and credible iraqi government that has the means to really keep the country together , " schulte said . european support needs to meet iraq 's needs a major task europeans should increasingly contribute to are security issues , schulte said . " without improving the security situation dramatically , there can not be any reconstruction in terms of infrastructure and other things that need to happen , such as education , sewage work and hospitals , " he said , adding that security training needed to be tailored to iraq 's needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german instructors are helping to train iraqi police " one of the criticisms against the german police training , for example , was that it was too european , " schulte said .
" they were training the police to patrol the streets like in a british , french or german suburb and it had nothing to do with the real situation of hard-boiled violence with a lot of arms in iraq . " but european nations could also play a part in other aspects of developing iraq 's statehood , according to kaim . " in order to build up a legitimate state , iraq also needs a tax system with financial income , it needs to develop a viable judicial system , and it needs economic well-being , " kaim said .
" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play . " the key is getting iran on board and europe can help put pressure on iran to use its influence to stop shia attacks , " said graeme herd , international security expert from the geneva center for security policy in switzerland .
" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground . " and if nothing came out of it , european countries can at least say they tried , " kaim addded . europe needs to speak with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler does n't shy away from controversial issues president köhler said it was in europe 's interest to get involved . " we can not allow the region to slide into chaos , " köhler said .
a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .
" but ducking away and just watching is the worse alternative . " now it is up to europe to find a common policy , schulte said . " i think the old question that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger asked , ' if i have a crisis , whom do i call in europe ? ' is still valid , " schulte said .
" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles . " all that will pressure the europeans into a new role that is n't there yet , " schulte said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 15.11.2006 " we 're really way ahead of the politicians " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : krzeminski : " i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other " polish journalist adam krzeminski on thursday will be honored for his efforts to improve german-polish relations .
in a dw-world.de interview , he talked about reasons for continuing problems between the two countries . born in western galicia in 1945 , krzeminski is one of poland 's leading journalists .
he has worked at the polityka newspaper since 1973 .
in 1993 , he received the goethe medal for his efforts to promote german-polish understanding .
he will receive the viadrina award of the european university viadrina frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday . dw-world.de : german-polish relations are tense at the moment .
in germany , the kaczynski brothers - the polish president and the polish prime minister - are blamed for this .
is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .
polish historians worked on the bonn exhibition " escape , expulsion , integration . "
the debate surrounding a center against expulsions as promoted by the federation of expellees , however , deals with a fundamental question : is it possible to look at various expulsion , deportations and flight movements of the 20th century in a single museum without blurring the lines between perpetrators and victims of a war of aggression ?
a second level of the dispute has to do with past of the federation of expellees that has not been dealt with .

" this concerns us , " schäuble said , adding that the statistic may not mean that violence has increased but that more citizens are reporting domestic violence crimes . perception versus reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the security situation is objectively good , " said zypries schäuble and zypries added that the public 's impression of the frequency of violent crime has been distorted by over-emphasis in the media , particularly in murder and sexual abuse cases involving children . " people think far more of these crimes happen than in reality , " zypries said .
" as awful as the individual cases are , the number is not so large . " in a television interview wednesday with german public broadcaster ard , zypries said that more people in germany feel safe .

" our perception is different in many respects and i think that the police are closer to reality than many politicians . " freiberg said that , while the number of police officers in germany has dropped from 273,000 to 266,000 in the past five years , violence against officers has increased sharply . he was re-elected tuesday by a 95 percent majority vote as chairman of the police union , which represents 54 percent of germany 's police officers . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german jewish leader says right-wing violence recalls 1930s the president of the central council of jews in germany has said that the country was seeing a groundswell of right-wing violence which reminded her of the nazi era .

" in addition to the highly private inkling that he was not wanted by his parents , he now has official confirmation that he was born by mistake , " the paper wrote . in arguments in the court , however , the prosecuting lawyer insisted that " it 's not the child 's existence that is seen as a damage - just his child support payments .

in a dw-world.de interview , he talked about reasons for continuing problems between the two countries . born in western galicia in 1945 , krzeminski is one of poland 's leading journalists .
he has worked at the polityka newspaper since 1973 .
in 1993 , he received the goethe medal for his efforts to promote german-polish understanding .
he will receive the viadrina award of the european university viadrina frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday . dw-world.de : german-polish relations are tense at the moment .
in germany , the kaczynski brothers - the polish president and the polish prime minister - are blamed for this .
is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .
polish historians worked on the bonn exhibition " escape , expulsion , integration . "
the debate surrounding a center against expulsions as promoted by the federation of expellees , however , deals with a fundamental question : is it possible to look at various expulsion , deportations and flight movements of the 20th century in a single museum without blurring the lines between perpetrators and victims of a war of aggression ?
a second level of the dispute has to do with past of the federation of expellees that has not been dealt with .
if we disentangle the different layers , a common remembrance is possible . is there a danger that the present cooling of the german-polish relationship will become permanent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viadrina university is located in germany and poland during the past years , we have witnessed what 's almost a miracle of good neighborhood .
despite the cold that 's crept into german-polish relations on the political level , normal contacts continue to exist .
along the border there are dozens of towns that have good relationships .
remember the lifting of visa requirements in 1991 , when the first polish tourists were greeted with bats or the bread roll war of the mid-1990s , when german trade unionists demonstrated against their polish competitors .
today , very little of this negative mood has survived in the border region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.11.2006 bundesliga continues to slide in international rankings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's fall to earth is just one reason for germany 's poor showing estimates using uefa 's ranking system confirm what most fans already know - the bundesliga is anything but one of the top soccer leagues in europe .
and things are set to get worse . european soccer 's governing body uefa only publishes its league rankings at the end of the season .
but in the latest calculations using the uefa system , the bundesliga only ranks seventh this year - behind romania , england , italy , spain , france , russia and bulgaria .
and that could mean one team fewer in the champions league .
germany is still in fifth place ahead of portugal and romania in uefa 's all-important five-year rankings .
but for the first time less than two points separate the bundesliga from the seventh spot .
if the bundesliga falls a couple more notches , german clubs would only be allocated two - and not the current three - berths in the champions league .
fans and team management are worried .
rules or results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says the ranking system is a joke last week , bayern munich vice-chairman karl-heinz rummenigge lashed out at the uefa rankings system , which awards points for wins in both the champions league and the uefa cup .
" i can not accept that romania are a danger to the bundesliga because they collect their points in the uefa cup , " rummennige fumed .
" it 's a joke . "
but others disagree , pointing out that in fact the uefa does award extra points for champions league results .
" the system reflects teams ' performances , " soccer journalist uli hesse-lichtenberger told dw-online .

in a dw-world.de interview , he talked about reasons for continuing problems between the two countries . born in western galicia in 1945 , krzeminski is one of poland 's leading journalists .
he has worked at the polityka newspaper since 1973 .
in 1993 , he received the goethe medal for his efforts to promote german-polish understanding .
he will receive the viadrina award of the european university viadrina frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- on thursday . dw-world.de : german-polish relations are tense at the moment .
in germany , the kaczynski brothers - the polish president and the polish prime minister - are blamed for this .
is it really that simple ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaczynski twins occupy poland 's highest offices adam krzeminski : it 's partly because of the tone of the kaczynski brothers and the fall-back on historical traumas that 's happening within their party of law and justice .
but apart from that there are substantial issues that cloud the german-polish community of interests of the 1990s : the baltic sea pipeline and the controversy surrounding a center against expulsions .
still this should n't be exaggerated - we have created so many institutional connections that the community of interests still works in fact .
polish surveys are the best proof for this : they are very positive for germany and germans . you mentioned the 1990s , when germany lobbied for poland 's eu membership .
now , the german behavior in connection with the baltic sea pipeline is feeding fears in poland .
are poles fixated on the negative ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction of the baltic sea pipeline began nearly a year ago the polish perception might be selective , but this is also true for the german perception of european politics and own economic interests .
regarding the pipeline , there 's an economic level on the one hand : the pipeline exposes poland to potential blackmailing from russia , because it could be used to supply germany with natural gas even if deliveries to poland are shut down .
and then there 's a political level : one could also imagine a pipeline that 's embedded in a european energy policy and that does not make the eu dependent - and therefore exposed to potential blackmail - on russian energy sources .
this was never discussed .
maybe that 's starting now - and possibly it will solve the dispute . former polish president alexander kwasniewksi recently said that germans do n't take poles seriously ... i think he was n't just talking about the pipeline .
we have a sliding scale of sympathies .
the poles are slowly losing their old aversion against their western neighbor , but this process is taking even longer in germany , as polls show .
in germany , the traditional view of europe is one , where only large countries count while smaller ones have to give in - that 's the way things worked in the 19th and 20th centuries .
but that 's a perception that would have to disappear over time as europe unifies .
from a polish point of view , the process of accepting the eastern neighbor is taking longer than one would hope . is the german view of poland big-headed ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans still see poland as a country of farmers there 's definitely a traditional disrespect .
let me just remind you of the ideology of frederick the great that was influential in the 18th and 19th century .
it saw poles as " europe 's iroquois . "
we 're also familiar with the talk about poland 's economy , the polish government and the polish inability to build an enlightened state .
all of these were forced arguments to justify the division of poland .
of course some of that remains in the back of german minds .
jokes about poles are a part of this - the idea that poles are thieves , who first robbed silesia from the germans , then stole their cars and are now taking away their jobs . there was a so-called war of jokes , during which german and polish newspapers - more or less intelligently - made fun of the citizens of the other country .
is this a sign of a relaxed relationship ? i do n't think that clichés can be fought with counter-clichés .
but a war of jokes is clearly better than a war of potatoes like the one that took place last summer , when president kaczynski cancelled a meeting with chancellor merkel because of a satire in die tageszeitung .
i 'm hoping for a situation where it 's possible to make jokes about each other , but at the same time lead fundamental debates - accompanied by educational efforts that will allow people to get to know their new , old neighbors . expulsions in different forms have always played a role in the german-polish relationship .
is a common remembrance possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many poles look fondly at erika steinbach , the president of the federation of expellees it already exists .
the expulsions are dealt with at many local folk museums in the formerly german areas .
polish historians worked on the bonn exhibition " escape , expulsion , integration . "
the debate surrounding a center against expulsions as promoted by the federation of expellees , however , deals with a fundamental question : is it possible to look at various expulsion , deportations and flight movements of the 20th century in a single museum without blurring the lines between perpetrators and victims of a war of aggression ?
a second level of the dispute has to do with past of the federation of expellees that has not been dealt with .
if we disentangle the different layers , a common remembrance is possible . is there a danger that the present cooling of the german-polish relationship will become permanent ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viadrina university is located in germany and poland during the past years , we have witnessed what 's almost a miracle of good neighborhood .
despite the cold that 's crept into german-polish relations on the political level , normal contacts continue to exist .
along the border there are dozens of towns that have good relationships .
remember the lifting of visa requirements in 1991 , when the first polish tourists were greeted with bats or the bread roll war of the mid-1990s , when german trade unionists demonstrated against their polish competitors .
today , very little of this negative mood has survived in the border region .
we 're really way ahead of the politicians . dennis stute interviewed adam krzeminski -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war compensation claims still plague polish-german ties germany and poland have a long list of grievances ; the longest running being the quest for compensation by germans expelled from poland after 1945 .
but is the topic just political ammunition for a nationalist agenda ? -lrb- 30.10.2006 -rrb- germany hopes for better ties as polish premier visits berlin following a series of controversies that cloud german-polish relations , poland 's premier visits berlin monday .
relations at the top level remain icy , but young poles seem to have a more positive view of their neighbors .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .
but her small election margin meant she was forced into a difficult partnership with the left-wing social democrats instead . ' adding to political apathy ' now , westerwelle is one of the loudest critics of the current administration , which he blames for failing to bring about a real economic recovery in germany . " the worrying thing about this so-called grand coalition is that it 's contributing to a shocking degree of political apathy , " the 44-year-old politician told reuters on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some , ' the grand coalition ' has been a disappointment " we can not allow this grand coalition to lead to the same end as the last one in 1969 , when the far-right npd nearly made it into the federal parliament . " the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- came close to reaching the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the bundestag in 1969 , when germany 's only other post-war " grand coalition " was voted out of office after three difficult years . npd compared to nazis the npd is often compared with hitler 's early nazi party .
it is especially strong in the depressed eastern part of the country .
in september , it took 7.3 percent of the vote in merkel 's home base of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
disillusionment with her coalition was seen as a key reason for the npd 's gains . in the interview , westerwelle attacked merkel 's government for pushing through the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , for failing to reduce non-wage labor costs and for creating more bureaucracy - all moves he said ran counter to the campaign pledges of the governing parties . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.11.2006 bundesliga continues to slide in international rankings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's fall to earth is just one reason for germany 's poor showing estimates using uefa 's ranking system confirm what most fans already know - the bundesliga is anything but one of the top soccer leagues in europe .
and things are set to get worse . european soccer 's governing body uefa only publishes its league rankings at the end of the season .
but in the latest calculations using the uefa system , the bundesliga only ranks seventh this year - behind romania , england , italy , spain , france , russia and bulgaria .
and that could mean one team fewer in the champions league .
germany is still in fifth place ahead of portugal and romania in uefa 's all-important five-year rankings .
but for the first time less than two points separate the bundesliga from the seventh spot .
if the bundesliga falls a couple more notches , german clubs would only be allocated two - and not the current three - berths in the champions league .
fans and team management are worried .
rules or results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says the ranking system is a joke last week , bayern munich vice-chairman karl-heinz rummenigge lashed out at the uefa rankings system , which awards points for wins in both the champions league and the uefa cup .
" i can not accept that romania are a danger to the bundesliga because they collect their points in the uefa cup , " rummennige fumed .
" it 's a joke . "
but others disagree , pointing out that in fact the uefa does award extra points for champions league results .
" the system reflects teams ' performances , " soccer journalist uli hesse-lichtenberger told dw-online .
" and in any case the rules are the same for everyone . "
so what 's caused such a mighty come-down for a league that once dominated european soccer ?
hamburg and other catastrophes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke crashed out of the uefa cup against french side nancy much has been made of hamburg 's failure to earn a single point in this year 's champions league - the worst performance ever by a bundesliga side in that competition .
critics also complain that no german team has won a major european club tournament since 2001 , and that even mighty bayern have fallen out of the uefa top ten . " if you look at the champions league , there 's a clear difference in quality , " reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , told dw-online .
" the only teams we have that can compete at that level are bayern and maybe bremen . " but the bundesliga 's precipitous decline has just as much to do with its perennial also-rans as with its leading lights .
" the teams a bit further back are equally important , " explained hesse-lichtenberger .
" what we need are not necessarily teams winning the champions league , but making the quarterfinals of the uefa cup . " hertha berlin and schalke are already out of that competition after losing to smaller clubs against which they were heavily favored .
that 's put the burden on bundesliga strugglers leverkusen and frankfurt to pick up much-needed points . the money question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams like frankfurt are having to fight for uefa points bundesliga managers never tire of complaining that there 's more money floating around in other leagues - chiefly spain , england and italy - than in the bundesliga .
and there 's some validity to that argument . " we have to accept that we 're going to lose some matches against spanish clubs , " hesse-lichtenberger conceded .
" but at the same time we have to win against belgian or french teams . " getting results against underdogs could become even more important , if french soccer legend michel platini gets his way .
platini , who 's vying to become uefa 's next president , says he 'd like to give smaller leagues , especially in eastern europe , more berths in international competitions - at the expense of the continent 's traditional powerhouses . in any case , german soccer fans have to hope that the few german clubs still alive in international competition pick up enough points to brakes on the league 's perilous slide .
" it 's quite clear , said hesse-lichtenberger , " that we 've got big problems this year . "

german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
experts say any additional efforts will only be successful if countries cooperate with the united states . europe needs to strengthen the dialogue with the united states on the future of iraq , according to german president horst köhler . " the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" that would be dumb , short-sighted and arrogant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said sending more troops would n't help the iraqi security situation the failure of us troops in iraq has proven that europe can rule out helping with military manpower . " that is absolutely impossible , " said markus kaim , european and atlantic security expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the key issue is reinstalling iraq 's statehood , as government authority has no meaning in wide parts of the country . " german defense analyst heinz schulte said europe can support measures to secure the post-war environment in iraq . " europeans can play a constructive role in that transitional period between the withdrawal of american and british forces on the one hand and the establishment of a secure and credible iraqi government that has the means to really keep the country together , " schulte said . european support needs to meet iraq 's needs a major task europeans should increasingly contribute to are security issues , schulte said . " without improving the security situation dramatically , there can not be any reconstruction in terms of infrastructure and other things that need to happen , such as education , sewage work and hospitals , " he said , adding that security training needed to be tailored to iraq 's needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german instructors are helping to train iraqi police " one of the criticisms against the german police training , for example , was that it was too european , " schulte said .
" they were training the police to patrol the streets like in a british , french or german suburb and it had nothing to do with the real situation of hard-boiled violence with a lot of arms in iraq . " but european nations could also play a part in other aspects of developing iraq 's statehood , according to kaim . " in order to build up a legitimate state , iraq also needs a tax system with financial income , it needs to develop a viable judicial system , and it needs economic well-being , " kaim said .
" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play . " the key is getting iran on board and europe can help put pressure on iran to use its influence to stop shia attacks , " said graeme herd , international security expert from the geneva center for security policy in switzerland .
" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground . " and if nothing came out of it , european countries can at least say they tried , " kaim addded . europe needs to speak with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler does n't shy away from controversial issues president köhler said it was in europe 's interest to get involved . " we can not allow the region to slide into chaos , " köhler said .
a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .
" but ducking away and just watching is the worse alternative . " now it is up to europe to find a common policy , schulte said . " i think the old question that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger asked , ' if i have a crisis , whom do i call in europe ? ' is still valid , " schulte said .
" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles . " all that will pressure the europeans into a new role that is n't there yet , " schulte said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's free democrat opposition party , has said chancellor angela merkel and the " grand coalition " government is contributing to political apathy and driving voters into the arms of far-right politicians . in an interview with reuters news service , westerwelle harshly criticized angela merkel 's performance after her first year in office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle was frozen out by merkel after the vote during the last national elections in germany , westerwelle 's party was on track to form a coalition government with merkel 's christian democrats .

" the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- came close to reaching the 5 percent threshold needed to enter the bundestag in 1969 , when germany 's only other post-war " grand coalition " was voted out of office after three difficult years . npd compared to nazis the npd is often compared with hitler 's early nazi party .
it is especially strong in the depressed eastern part of the country .
in september , it took 7.3 percent of the vote in merkel 's home base of mecklenburg-western pomerania .
disillusionment with her coalition was seen as a key reason for the npd 's gains . in the interview , westerwelle attacked merkel 's government for pushing through the biggest tax hike in post-war german history , for failing to reduce non-wage labor costs and for creating more bureaucracy - all moves he said ran counter to the campaign pledges of the governing parties . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .

german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
experts say any additional efforts will only be successful if countries cooperate with the united states . europe needs to strengthen the dialogue with the united states on the future of iraq , according to german president horst köhler . " the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .

a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 15.11.2006 bundesliga continues to slide in international rankings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's fall to earth is just one reason for germany 's poor showing estimates using uefa 's ranking system confirm what most fans already know - the bundesliga is anything but one of the top soccer leagues in europe .
and things are set to get worse . european soccer 's governing body uefa only publishes its league rankings at the end of the season .
but in the latest calculations using the uefa system , the bundesliga only ranks seventh this year - behind romania , england , italy , spain , france , russia and bulgaria .
and that could mean one team fewer in the champions league .
germany is still in fifth place ahead of portugal and romania in uefa 's all-important five-year rankings .
but for the first time less than two points separate the bundesliga from the seventh spot .
if the bundesliga falls a couple more notches , german clubs would only be allocated two - and not the current three - berths in the champions league .
fans and team management are worried .
rules or results ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge says the ranking system is a joke last week , bayern munich vice-chairman karl-heinz rummenigge lashed out at the uefa rankings system , which awards points for wins in both the champions league and the uefa cup .
" i can not accept that romania are a danger to the bundesliga because they collect their points in the uefa cup , " rummennige fumed .
" it 's a joke . "
but others disagree , pointing out that in fact the uefa does award extra points for champions league results .
" the system reflects teams ' performances , " soccer journalist uli hesse-lichtenberger told dw-online .
" and in any case the rules are the same for everyone . "
so what 's caused such a mighty come-down for a league that once dominated european soccer ?
hamburg and other catastrophes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke crashed out of the uefa cup against french side nancy much has been made of hamburg 's failure to earn a single point in this year 's champions league - the worst performance ever by a bundesliga side in that competition .
critics also complain that no german team has won a major european club tournament since 2001 , and that even mighty bayern have fallen out of the uefa top ten . " if you look at the champions league , there 's a clear difference in quality , " reiner holzschuh , editor-in-chief of the german soccer magazine kicker , told dw-online .
" the only teams we have that can compete at that level are bayern and maybe bremen . " but the bundesliga 's precipitous decline has just as much to do with its perennial also-rans as with its leading lights .
" the teams a bit further back are equally important , " explained hesse-lichtenberger .
" what we need are not necessarily teams winning the champions league , but making the quarterfinals of the uefa cup . " hertha berlin and schalke are already out of that competition after losing to smaller clubs against which they were heavily favored .
that 's put the burden on bundesliga strugglers leverkusen and frankfurt to pick up much-needed points . the money question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams like frankfurt are having to fight for uefa points bundesliga managers never tire of complaining that there 's more money floating around in other leagues - chiefly spain , england and italy - than in the bundesliga .
and there 's some validity to that argument . " we have to accept that we 're going to lose some matches against spanish clubs , " hesse-lichtenberger conceded .
" but at the same time we have to win against belgian or french teams . " getting results against underdogs could become even more important , if french soccer legend michel platini gets his way .

german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
but what sort of options can europe offer to constructively support the country 's future ? german president horst köhler has called on european nations to take more action to help stabilize iraq .
experts say any additional efforts will only be successful if countries cooperate with the united states . europe needs to strengthen the dialogue with the united states on the future of iraq , according to german president horst köhler . " the war has led to a disaster , but we ca n't sit back and say it 's a problem for the americans , " köhler said in an interview with german newspaper frankfurter rundschau .
" that would be dumb , short-sighted and arrogant . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said sending more troops would n't help the iraqi security situation the failure of us troops in iraq has proven that europe can rule out helping with military manpower . " that is absolutely impossible , " said markus kaim , european and atlantic security expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the key issue is reinstalling iraq 's statehood , as government authority has no meaning in wide parts of the country . " german defense analyst heinz schulte said europe can support measures to secure the post-war environment in iraq . " europeans can play a constructive role in that transitional period between the withdrawal of american and british forces on the one hand and the establishment of a secure and credible iraqi government that has the means to really keep the country together , " schulte said . european support needs to meet iraq 's needs a major task europeans should increasingly contribute to are security issues , schulte said . " without improving the security situation dramatically , there can not be any reconstruction in terms of infrastructure and other things that need to happen , such as education , sewage work and hospitals , " he said , adding that security training needed to be tailored to iraq 's needs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german instructors are helping to train iraqi police " one of the criticisms against the german police training , for example , was that it was too european , " schulte said .
" they were training the police to patrol the streets like in a british , french or german suburb and it had nothing to do with the real situation of hard-boiled violence with a lot of arms in iraq . " but european nations could also play a part in other aspects of developing iraq 's statehood , according to kaim . " in order to build up a legitimate state , iraq also needs a tax system with financial income , it needs to develop a viable judicial system , and it needs economic well-being , " kaim said .
" europe can help with these aspects of good governance . " europe can be an intermediary to syria and iran britain , the longtime us ally in iraq , has , like washington , recognized that its policies in iraq can not continue as they are now .
british prime minister tony blair has called for a change in strategy in iraq .
in a keynote speech monday evening , blair said a major part of the answer to the iraq problem " lies not in iraq itself but outside it , in the whole of the region where the same forces are at work . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is rethinking the british army 's presence in iraq it is precisely here that europeans can take on a mediating role the united states is reluctant to play . " the key is getting iran on board and europe can help put pressure on iran to use its influence to stop shia attacks , " said graeme herd , international security expert from the geneva center for security policy in switzerland .
" otherwise , the situation will continue to fall apart and this is not beneficial to the entire region . " but , experts agreed , both sides have to work together . " i think there is a role for europeans to play here , but it can not be bad cop and good cop , " schulte said .
" the idea that the united states and , to a lesser extent , the british are the bad cops and have to leave the country and now the airy-fairies of the european union come in and try to rectify the situation - that 's not going to work .
it has to be a concerted effort . " in order to get any help , however , washington will have to offer something in return . " we can be good partners , but we do n't have to pay the price , " herd said .
if europe were to ask iran for help , it will ask for something in return and the us will have to make those concessions , he said . still , europe had nothing to lose by hosting a regional iraq conference , kaim said .
such a diplomatic investment did n't pose a danger to anyone , which is n't the case for example for police instructors working on the ground . " and if nothing came out of it , european countries can at least say they tried , " kaim addded . europe needs to speak with a united voice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president köhler does n't shy away from controversial issues president köhler said it was in europe 's interest to get involved . " we can not allow the region to slide into chaos , " köhler said .
a perspective for stability in the near and middle east held political risk and will carry a price tag , though . " responsibility has its price , " the president said .
" but ducking away and just watching is the worse alternative . " now it is up to europe to find a common policy , schulte said . " i think the old question that -lrb- former us secretary of state -rrb- henry kissinger asked , ' if i have a crisis , whom do i call in europe ? ' is still valid , " schulte said .
" the french look upon europe in a different light than the british do , and the germans again have a different agenda .
so from that point of view : what is a european perspective ? " schulte said europe is facing a wide range of challenges including the deployment in the congo , the situation in darfur in sudan , and the middle east conflict , all of which are influencing european countries ' international roles . " all that will pressure the europeans into a new role that is n't there yet , " schulte said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no larger military role for germany as eu debates afghanistan top german politicians rebuffed increased pressure from nato monday to send troops to hot spots in southern afghanistan , but they did agree to consider increasing civilian reconstruction and police training efforts .

" in addition to the highly private inkling that he was not wanted by his parents , he now has official confirmation that he was born by mistake , " the paper wrote . in arguments in the court , however , the prosecuting lawyer insisted that " it 's not the child 's existence that is seen as a damage - just his child support payments .

the calculations by the bonn-based environmental group germanwatch took into account emissions levels , emissions trends and climate policy . sweden , britain and denmark topped the rankings .
but , christoph bals , the director of germanwatch , said the current efforts by the top scorers are not enough to effectively curb and reverse global warming .
even sweden is like a one-eyed king among the blind , he said . the united states - the world ’ s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases - ranked at 53 , with only china , malaysia and saudi arabia doing worse . what happens after 2012 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel is in nairobi for the climate change conference the index 's release came as the world 's environment ministers gathered in the kenyan capital nairobi for the decisive phase of the un climate change conference . the ministers are under pressure to develop a framework to replace the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 . the german delegation at the conference , which finishes on friday , is led by environment minister sigmar gabriel . germany 's emissions on the rise before leaving for nairobi , gabriel said that based on preliminary data , germany 's carbon dioxide emissions actually rose in 2003 and 2004 .
he said this was due to increases in emissions from power plants and industry , even though they had promised to cut those emissions . " that means we will have to tighten the screws even further , " gabriel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf says germany 's frimmersdorf coal-fired power plant is the second worst climate polluter in europe .
under the kyoto protocol , germany is committed to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 21 percent from 1990 to 2012 .
much of germany 's initial advances toward the target are due to the collapse of former east germany 's heavily polluting industry . " we 'll have to take tougher measures , " gabriel said .
" despite their requirements to cut co2 emissions , power plants and the industry actually increased those .
evidently , they exported more power or older power plants were used . " " if we do n't reach our targets , then it will be difficult to convince the developing and newly industrialized countries to agree to a post-kyoto protocol , " he said . gabriel also stressed the need to help developing countries adapt to climate change because they were n't responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions causing the problems .
the situation in africa " is dramatic " , he said . us wakes up to climate change but gabriel said he saw welcome signals from the united states , even before last week 's elections where the democrats gained control of both houses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : californian gov. arnold schwarzenegger introduced the first us cap on greenhouse gases " the political climate in the united states on climate change has improved , " he said .
" it 's interesting that a republican governor , arnold schwarzenegger , bucked the trend and won .
others are now saying ' we have to do more ' . " the us , which produces around a quarter of the world 's greenhouse gases , has refused to sign the kyoto protocol .

but he still got slapped with a child support suit - and lost . to paraphrase a certain ex-us president , " he did not have sex with that woman . "
and this time , it was true . but a german court ruled court that a gynecologist must pay support for up to 18 years for a child who was conceived because of a botched a contraceptive implant . the karlsruhe-based federal appeals court ruled tuesday that the doctor must pay his former patient , now a mother of a three-year-old boy , 600 euros -lrb- $ 769 -rrb- a month because she became pregnant after he implanted her with a contraceptive device . six-month surprise in february 2002 , the then-21 year old plaintiff had just finished training to become a preschool teacher and had just accepted her first job .

" in addition to the highly private inkling that he was not wanted by his parents , he now has official confirmation that he was born by mistake , " the paper wrote . in arguments in the court , however , the prosecuting lawyer insisted that " it 's not the child 's existence that is seen as a damage - just his child support payments .

so carol kirkwood and sports presenter chris hollins did n't have to think for too long , when they were asked to learn a dance routine , on ice , for children in need .
it 's mission accomplished for both chris and carol - they danced live on bbc one , watched by millions .
and they managed to stay on two feet following weeks of training .
you can watch the highlights of their ice dance routine - from the link to the right , and chris and carol relive their ordeal on tuesday 's breakfast sponsor carol and chris for children in need and they have been keeping a blog of their progress here on this page .
carol and chris 's blog 19 december - chris hollins writes : " eleven days to go .
time is running out to get it right and we have so much to work to do .
that ice is slippery and if you have my sense of rhythm you are asking for trouble .
the music is chosen and the opening moves are being perfected .
but carol and i are struggling to put them together .
as soon as the music starts playing we forget everything .
the routine itself consists of a number of dance steps at the top and some gentle spins .
sounds simple but that ice is slippery and if you have my sense of rhythm you are asking for trouble .
ugly falls carol can shake her thing with the best of them and she is really showing me up .
we then have to attempt a lift .
my partner candi is just beginning to trust me .
she must be mad .
we have had a number of ugly falls .
but you know what they say about getting it right on the night .
out of the corner of my eye i can see that carol and james are a great combination .
carol 's skating really has come along .
let 's hope her nerves hold out .
we will be at somerset house on friday morning for our last rehearsal .
and breakfast viewers will get a sneak preview .
carol and i will be performing live on the programme .
any last minute tips would be much appreciated . " 30 november - chris hollins writes : " we 're almost at the halfway point and panic is setting in ! !
it 's much tougher than we thought it would be .
after making so much progress so quickly in the first two weeks both carol and i feel we have reached our peak .
and that 's not good because we are still a million miles away from being ready to perform in front of 10 million people ! !
" over the last couple of weeks we have gone from gingerly scraping our way across the rink to something resembling skating .
" we are beginning to turn , spin and we have even attempted lifts !
now that 's all good but when carol and i try and combine our newly-learnt skills with music we both lose the plot ! "
thank goodness for our partners candy and james and of course our coaching staff : diane , phillipa and phil .
they are trully amazing .
" they never lose their temper .
they accept the apologies for my swearing without complaint and always the first there to pick us up and dust us down before we try all over again ! !
" joan and the gang at the streatham ice rink should also get a mention for all their support .
they hide their giggles extremely well whenever they see us !
" as you may have seen on breakfast we now have the music and the start of a routine. it includes spins , jumps and the occasional lift .
it may look simple but let me assure you it is n't . "
we are putting in the hours every week to make you proud .
" carol and i and of course everyone associated with children in need would like to thank you all for sponsoring us and we are determined not to let you down .
there will be another update soon .
carol kirkwood 's blog 31 october - getting the boot ... s kitted out with our boots today , but i am never going to be able to do this ... it is so so hard .
i am terrified of falling over and breaking something .
chris is really improving .
i feel hopeless .
champions diane and pippa are coaching us today .
had a spectacular fall and really hurt my coccyx - literally brought tears to my eyes .
1 november - ice partner skated with another champ james , he 's is going to be my skating partner .
like everyone we have met so far , he too is a wee honey with endless patience .
have been concerned about the lifts we are undoubtedly going to have to do , in case i am too heavy for james , but he lifted me like i was a feather and spun me round till i was dizzy ! 14 november - i 'm spinning around i did it !
for the first time in my life , diane got me skating around the rink all by myself !
i 'm so chuffed .
she is such a fantastic lady .
worked on our routine today .
we have changed the music to the scissor sisters ' do n't feel like dancing ' which really does make you feel like dancing .
this is just the best fun .
the guys with us are totally brilliant .
but when chris and i start to laugh down we go ! 15 november - getting into a routine what a scream !
we did our the first third of our routine today - loosely speaking .
chris and i were all over the place .
having an absolute ball though !

and that 's not good because we are still a million miles away from being ready to perform in front of 10 million people ! !

" we are beginning to turn , spin and we have even attempted lifts !
now that 's all good but when carol and i try and combine our newly-learnt skills with music we both lose the plot ! "
thank goodness for our partners candy and james and of course our coaching staff : diane , phillipa and phil .
they are trully amazing .
" they never lose their temper .
they accept the apologies for my swearing without complaint and always the first there to pick us up and dust us down before we try all over again ! !
" joan and the gang at the streatham ice rink should also get a mention for all their support .
they hide their giggles extremely well whenever they see us !
" as you may have seen on breakfast we now have the music and the start of a routine. it includes spins , jumps and the occasional lift .
it may look simple but let me assure you it is n't . "
we are putting in the hours every week to make you proud .

so carol kirkwood and sports presenter chris hollins did n't have to think for too long , when they were asked to learn a dance routine , on ice , for children in need .
it 's mission accomplished for both chris and carol - they danced live on bbc one , watched by millions .
and they managed to stay on two feet following weeks of training .
you can watch the highlights of their ice dance routine - from the link to the right , and chris and carol relive their ordeal on tuesday 's breakfast sponsor carol and chris for children in need and they have been keeping a blog of their progress here on this page .
carol and chris 's blog 19 december - chris hollins writes : " eleven days to go .
time is running out to get it right and we have so much to work to do .
that ice is slippery and if you have my sense of rhythm you are asking for trouble .
the music is chosen and the opening moves are being perfected .
but carol and i are struggling to put them together .
as soon as the music starts playing we forget everything .
the routine itself consists of a number of dance steps at the top and some gentle spins .
sounds simple but that ice is slippery and if you have my sense of rhythm you are asking for trouble .
ugly falls carol can shake her thing with the best of them and she is really showing me up .
we then have to attempt a lift .
my partner candi is just beginning to trust me .
she must be mad .
we have had a number of ugly falls .
but you know what they say about getting it right on the night .
out of the corner of my eye i can see that carol and james are a great combination .
carol 's skating really has come along .
let 's hope her nerves hold out .
we will be at somerset house on friday morning for our last rehearsal .
and breakfast viewers will get a sneak preview .
carol and i will be performing live on the programme .
any last minute tips would be much appreciated . " 30 november - chris hollins writes : " we 're almost at the halfway point and panic is setting in ! !
it 's much tougher than we thought it would be .
after making so much progress so quickly in the first two weeks both carol and i feel we have reached our peak .
and that 's not good because we are still a million miles away from being ready to perform in front of 10 million people ! !
" over the last couple of weeks we have gone from gingerly scraping our way across the rink to something resembling skating .
" we are beginning to turn , spin and we have even attempted lifts !
now that 's all good but when carol and i try and combine our newly-learnt skills with music we both lose the plot ! "
thank goodness for our partners candy and james and of course our coaching staff : diane , phillipa and phil .
they are trully amazing .
" they never lose their temper .
they accept the apologies for my swearing without complaint and always the first there to pick us up and dust us down before we try all over again ! !
" joan and the gang at the streatham ice rink should also get a mention for all their support .
they hide their giggles extremely well whenever they see us !
" as you may have seen on breakfast we now have the music and the start of a routine. it includes spins , jumps and the occasional lift .
it may look simple but let me assure you it is n't . "
we are putting in the hours every week to make you proud .
" carol and i and of course everyone associated with children in need would like to thank you all for sponsoring us and we are determined not to let you down .
there will be another update soon .
carol kirkwood 's blog 31 october - getting the boot ... s kitted out with our boots today , but i am never going to be able to do this ... it is so so hard .
i am terrified of falling over and breaking something .
chris is really improving .
i feel hopeless .
champions diane and pippa are coaching us today .
had a spectacular fall and really hurt my coccyx - literally brought tears to my eyes .
1 november - ice partner skated with another champ james , he 's is going to be my skating partner .
like everyone we have met so far , he too is a wee honey with endless patience .
have been concerned about the lifts we are undoubtedly going to have to do , in case i am too heavy for james , but he lifted me like i was a feather and spun me round till i was dizzy ! 14 november - i 'm spinning around i did it !
for the first time in my life , diane got me skating around the rink all by myself !
i 'm so chuffed .
she is such a fantastic lady .
worked on our routine today .
we have changed the music to the scissor sisters ' do n't feel like dancing ' which really does make you feel like dancing .
this is just the best fun .

it is proposing to charge people who only have a current account a £ 10 monthly fee , potentially affecting up to 195,000 customers .
the fee will be waived if customers open a savings account or buy products such as home insurance or loans .
the bank said the move was aimed at dormant or rarely used accounts .
primary customers about 40,000 of its basic accounts are not used at all while a further 250,000 accounts see fewer than 10 transactions a month .
the new charging structure , part of an overhaul of fees for accounts and overdrafts , will come into effect in february . "

first direct , the uk telephone and internet banking arm of hsbc , will write to all its 1.3 million customers to let them know how they can avoid the £ 10 charge .
the fee will apply to those paying less than £ 1,500 into their account each month or those who have an average monthly balance below £ 1,500 .
" i want to focus our efforts on our most important customers : those who use us as their main bank or who have a number of products with us , " said chris pilling , first direct 's chief executive .
have your say " i closed my first direct account this morning " chris , london send us your comments " many of our customers do not enjoy the full benefits as they use us for a secondary account . "
first direct said it believed 85 % of its customers would be unaffected by the charges .

the recommendation is being put forward by the nuffield council on bioethics , which considers ethical questions raised by advances in medical research .
for those born after 23 weeks , the recommendation is that doctors should review the situation with the parents and take their wishes into account .
but doctors warned no two babies born at 22 or 23 weeks would be the same .
the report has been released after two years of research .
we do n't think it is always right to put a baby through the stress and pain of invasive treatment if the baby is unlikely to get any better and death is inevitable professor margaret brazier nuffield council on bioethics saving premature babies q & a : premature babies it also gives guidance on how parents should resolve arguments with doctors over the fate of their babies .
the report comes against a backdrop of medical advances which have been able to sustain the lives of very premature babies .
however , research shows that many of these babies do not live very long , or go on to develop severe disability .
part of the problem is that despite advances in modern medicine , it is not always obvious to doctors which babies will survive and thrive .
professor margaret brazier , who chaired the committee that produced the guidelines , said : " natural instincts are to try to save all babies , even if the baby 's chances of survival are low .
" however , we do n't think it is always right to put a baby through the stress and pain of invasive treatment if the baby is unlikely to get any better and death is inevitable . "
the inquiry also looked at longer-term support for families , and resource implications for the nhs .
but it rejected suggestions that active steps be taken to end life - so-called baby euthanasia - in certain circumstances .

the charity said the uk had the highest rate of low birth weight babies in western europe .
about 300 babies are born in the uk each year at 23 weeks .
they have a 17 % survival rate , compared with 50 % for those born at 25 weeks .
figures suggest that no baby survives at 21 weeks , while only 1 % survive to leave hospital at 22 weeks .
andy cole , bliss chief executive , said : " while only a small percentage of infants in the uk are born at 24 weeks or less , it is essential that every baby should be treated as an individual and given the best and most appropriate care at the point of life .
" we strongly endorse the recommendation that assessment of care for the most vulnerable infants needs to be a joint decision between parents and clinicians . "
all babies different we can not agree with stringent cut-off points for treatment dr tony calland british medical association send us your comments dr tony calland , chairman of the medical ethics committee of the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , said much of the report echoed " existing best practice " .
but he added : " the bma believes that blanket rules do not help individual parents or their very premature babies .
" each case should be considered on its merits and its own context .
while we believe that not all patients , including babies , benefit from medical intervention if survival is unlikely , it is important that each patient 's circumstances are assessed independently .
" we therefore can not agree with stringent cut-off points for treatment . "
bert massie , chairman of the disability rights commission , said : " the decision to treat or not treat should be based on individual assessment .
" to fail to do so would potentially be discriminatory and breach human rights legislation . "
there are about 250 units in the uk offering neonatal intensive care , high dependency and special care .
earlier this month the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists said it wanted a discussion over whether " deliberate intervention " to cause death in severely disabled babies should be legalised .
but the report recommends the active ending of the life of newborn babies should not be allowed , no matter how serious their condition .
the nuffield council on bioethics was established in 1991 to examine ethical questions raised by advances in biological and medical research .

the recommendation is being put forward by the nuffield council on bioethics , which considers ethical questions raised by advances in medical research .
for those born after 23 weeks , the recommendation is that doctors should review the situation with the parents and take their wishes into account .
but doctors warned no two babies born at 22 or 23 weeks would be the same .
the report has been released after two years of research .
we do n't think it is always right to put a baby through the stress and pain of invasive treatment if the baby is unlikely to get any better and death is inevitable professor margaret brazier nuffield council on bioethics saving premature babies q & a : premature babies it also gives guidance on how parents should resolve arguments with doctors over the fate of their babies .
the report comes against a backdrop of medical advances which have been able to sustain the lives of very premature babies .
however , research shows that many of these babies do not live very long , or go on to develop severe disability .
part of the problem is that despite advances in modern medicine , it is not always obvious to doctors which babies will survive and thrive .
professor margaret brazier , who chaired the committee that produced the guidelines , said : " natural instincts are to try to save all babies , even if the baby 's chances of survival are low .
" however , we do n't think it is always right to put a baby through the stress and pain of invasive treatment if the baby is unlikely to get any better and death is inevitable . "
the inquiry also looked at longer-term support for families , and resource implications for the nhs .
but it rejected suggestions that active steps be taken to end life - so-called baby euthanasia - in certain circumstances .
report recommendations born before 22 weeks : no intensive care 22-23 weeks : no intensive care , unless parents request it after a thorough discussion of the risks and doctors agree 23-24 weeks : parents , after a thorough discussion with the healthcare team , should have the final say 24-25 weeks : give intensive care , unless the parents and the doctors agree there is no hope of survival , or the level of suffering is too high above 25 weeks : intensive care as standard bliss , the premature baby charity , is campaigning for one-to-one neonatal intensive care , and for decisions to made based on clinical reasoning , and not financial constraints .
the charity said the uk had the highest rate of low birth weight babies in western europe .
about 300 babies are born in the uk each year at 23 weeks .
they have a 17 % survival rate , compared with 50 % for those born at 25 weeks .
figures suggest that no baby survives at 21 weeks , while only 1 % survive to leave hospital at 22 weeks .
andy cole , bliss chief executive , said : " while only a small percentage of infants in the uk are born at 24 weeks or less , it is essential that every baby should be treated as an individual and given the best and most appropriate care at the point of life .
" we strongly endorse the recommendation that assessment of care for the most vulnerable infants needs to be a joint decision between parents and clinicians . "
all babies different we can not agree with stringent cut-off points for treatment dr tony calland british medical association send us your comments dr tony calland , chairman of the medical ethics committee of the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- , said much of the report echoed " existing best practice " .
but he added : " the bma believes that blanket rules do not help individual parents or their very premature babies .
" each case should be considered on its merits and its own context .
while we believe that not all patients , including babies , benefit from medical intervention if survival is unlikely , it is important that each patient 's circumstances are assessed independently .
" we therefore can not agree with stringent cut-off points for treatment . "
bert massie , chairman of the disability rights commission , said : " the decision to treat or not treat should be based on individual assessment .
" to fail to do so would potentially be discriminatory and breach human rights legislation . "
there are about 250 units in the uk offering neonatal intensive care , high dependency and special care .
earlier this month the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists said it wanted a discussion over whether " deliberate intervention " to cause death in severely disabled babies should be legalised .
but the report recommends the active ending of the life of newborn babies should not be allowed , no matter how serious their condition .

once it had 5,000 workers - now there are just 66 .
there are little pockets of production , mostly older men bent over antique smelters , cutters and grinders .
but around them lie derelict machines and puddles from the leaky roof .
textile and tobacco plants have already shut down in this southern city and younger workers have left in their hundreds .
emigration gotse delchev is not alone .
as their nation modernises to finally shake off socialism and join the eu in january , bulgarians are being forced not just from outdated jobs but abroad to find work .
bulgaria 's population is falling faster than anywhere else in europe .
stoyan ryashev takes a negative view of the free market stoyan ryashev has worked at the electronics factory for 37 years .
both his sons have gone to spain .
" it 's a disaster .
the state does n't care about the factory or the workers , " stoyan says .
" and young people ca n't stay because there 's nothing for them .
this is a sad place .
you feel like you 're in a ghost town .
" we were better off under socialism .
we had security and a community here . "
the mayor of gotse delchev , vladimir moskov , took me to the town hall roof and waved a hand towards the green mountains .
it is , as he says , a beautiful setting .
" but we know our way of life alone wo n't keep people here , " he says .
" people want work , they need work .
" we have to make our local economy healthy again .
we need more state funds and investment from abroad to give everyone better prospects and a better income . "
rural poverty in a nation once famous for its agriculture the sense of abandonment is even stronger in the countryside .
abandoned homes are a common sight in the countryside the kutela valley , near the greek border , used to be a place of plenty , with walnut trees , apples and plums on collective farms dutifully tended under socialism .
but when the soviet union collapsed the market for bulgaria 's produce went with it .
now all those trees have gone and the fruits and vegetables people put on their table mostly come from abroad .
and scattered across the landscape now are dozens of deserted or almost deserted villages .
leshten had 40 households not so long ago - now there are just two .
weeds grow between the broken tiles on the rooftops and the odd dog sleeps below a broken cart .
the kirichevs are in their 70s , but still live off the land in leshten .
they are sorry though to see their neighbours gone , fields wasted , and the old ways forgotten .
we feel lost really donka kiricheva , bulgarian villager arsenas kirichev takes time off from sharpening his axe .
" i do n't find it a hardship living here - i 'm 79 now and i 've worked the fields all my life , " he says .
" but young people are not interested in the hardships of farming .
they 'd just like to be behind a desk . "
his wife donka was feeding their few sheep in the cobbled yard .
" i have plots of land handed down by my father which no-one wants to cultivate .
our children have gone to the cities like everybody else .
" we feel lost really .
in the old days there were celebrations here - with everyone getting together .
now that 's all gone .
there is nothing . "
low birth rate a survey says that if the trend continues bulgaria will lose a third of its 7.5 million population in a few decades ' time .
the exodus from bulgaria is set to increase as eu membership makes emigration easier .
but there is another factor behind the nation 's alarming population statistics : bulgarians are not having nearly enough babies .
vessela raykova says a bigger family would be a struggle to keep the population stable a birth rate of 2.2 is needed .
but it is presently 1.3 .
just one child is now most couples ' idea of an affordable family - even comparatively well-to-do professionals .
vessela raykova met me in sofia 's theatre park - proudly pushing baby radoslav in a new buggy .
she is a biologist and her husband a civil engineer .
even for them starting a family was a big decision , she said , and radoslav will not be getting a brother or a sister very soon .
" of course we want to have more children .
we 'd love to have two more .
but i ca n't see how this will happen in the next five years at least .
things like clothes for children are expensive , and we have had to borrow money .
" actually among our friends we are almost the only couple to have a baby .
no one else can afford to . "
depopulation is a serious practical worry for bulgaria 's government .
if the young keep leaving , or not starting families , there will be no wage-earners to pay for pensions and social welfare .
bulgaria 's minister for work , emilia maslarova , says " it 's important for young people to stay here and bring up their children , and we have a strategy to encourage them to do that .
" we are providing extra tax relief to persuade couples to have more children .
we have a policy to help new mothers go back to work quickly and there will be more kindergartens .
we know people want to stay in bulgaria if they can . "
generation gap back from the factory stoyan invited me to join him and his wife maria for supper in their small soviet-built apartment .
the food - sausages , cheese and salad , washed down by a heady grape brandy - was all home-produced to save money .
on the dresser were pictures of their two sons , strong-looking young men who are both labourers in barcelona .
the high spot of the evening was a call from spain .
yes , the boys are both fine - and the boss there says there is still work to be had .
but stoyan and maria were sad at their family divide .
depopulation makes gotse delchev a lonely place , stoyan said .
" i see the few people left in my factory walking around after work .
they have grim faces and empty souls .
it 's a shame we ca n't be together with our children .
but i do n't see how that can change . "
earlier i had left one of the last inhabitants of leshten - a stooped arsenas kirichev out on the hillside with his now sharp axe , cutting wood as the sun set .
his is the only fire to burn in his village these nights .
bulgarians would like to keep their special national identity as they step towards a new future in europe .
to do that though its people must first feel secure enough to put their roots down here .

once it had 5,000 workers - now there are just 66 .
there are little pockets of production , mostly older men bent over antique smelters , cutters and grinders .
but around them lie derelict machines and puddles from the leaky roof .
textile and tobacco plants have already shut down in this southern city and younger workers have left in their hundreds .
emigration gotse delchev is not alone .
as their nation modernises to finally shake off socialism and join the eu in january , bulgarians are being forced not just from outdated jobs but abroad to find work .
bulgaria 's population is falling faster than anywhere else in europe .
stoyan ryashev has worked at the electronics factory for 37 years .
both his sons have gone to spain .
" it 's a disaster .
the state does n't care about the factory or the workers , " stoyan says .
" and young people ca n't stay because there 's nothing for them .
this is a sad place .
you feel like you 're in a ghost town .
" we were better off under socialism .
we had security and a community here . "
the mayor of gotse delchev , vladimir moskov , took me to the town hall roof and waved a hand towards the green mountains .
it is , as he says , a beautiful setting .
" but we know our way of life alone wo n't keep people here , " he says .
" people want work , they need work .
" we have to make our local economy healthy again .
we need more state funds and investment from abroad to give everyone better prospects and a better income . "
rural poverty in a nation once famous for its agriculture the sense of abandonment is even stronger in the countryside .
the kutela valley , near the greek border , used to be a place of plenty , with walnut trees , apples and plums on collective farms dutifully tended under socialism .
but when the soviet union collapsed the market for bulgaria 's produce went with it .
now all those trees have gone and the fruits and vegetables people put on their table mostly come from abroad .
and scattered across the landscape now are dozens of deserted or almost deserted villages .
leshten had 40 households not so long ago - now there are just two .
weeds grow between the broken tiles on the rooftops and the odd dog sleeps below a broken cart .
the kirichevs are in their 70s , but still live off the land in leshten .
they are sorry though to see their neighbours gone , fields wasted , and the old ways forgotten . "
we feel lost really " donka kiricheva , bulgarian villager arsenas kirichev takes time off from sharpening his axe .
" i do n't find it a hardship living here - i 'm 79 now and i 've worked the fields all my life , " he says .
" but young people are not interested in the hardships of farming .
they 'd just like to be behind a desk . "
his wife donka was feeding their few sheep in the cobbled yard .
" i have plots of land handed down by my father which no-one wants to cultivate .
our children have gone to the cities like everybody else .
" we feel lost really .
in the old days there were celebrations here - with everyone getting together .
now that 's all gone .
there is nothing . "
low birth rate a survey says that if the trend continues bulgaria will lose a third of its 7.5 million population in a few decades ' time .
the exodus from bulgaria is set to increase as eu membership makes emigration easier .
but there is another factor behind the nation 's alarming population statistics : bulgarians are not having nearly enough babies .
to keep the population stable a birth rate of 2.2 is needed .
but it is presently 1.3 .
just one child is now most couples ' idea of an affordable family - even comparatively well-to-do professionals .
vessela raykova met me in sofia 's theatre park - proudly pushing baby radoslav in a new buggy .
she is a biologist and her husband a civil engineer .
even for them starting a family was a big decision , she said , and radoslav will not be getting a brother or a sister very soon .
" of course we want to have more children .
we 'd love to have two more .
but i ca n't see how this will happen in the next five years at least .
things like clothes for children are expensive , and we have had to borrow money .
" actually among our friends we are almost the only couple to have a baby .
no one else can afford to . "

written by the government and delivered by the reigning monarch , the queen 's speech sets out the legislative agenda for the year ahead and is the centrepiece of the state opening of parliament .
each session of parliament begins with this royal address , and usually takes place in november , and covers the following year .
the ceremonial trappings surrounding the speech make the event one of the high points of the parliamentary calendar , unrivalled in its spectacle and tradition despite some of the more arcane practices having been toned down in recent years .
the queen normally attends in person at the state opening of parliament and delivers the speech from the grand throne in the house of lords .
her speech does not set out the entirety of the government 's programme , however .
the budget , and its recent addition the pre-budget report , have also been increasingly used to set out strategy and announce new measures .
final say the decision over what to put in or leave out of the queen 's speech is a politically crucial one , usually the subject of months of political wrangling within government as ministers and lobby groups fight for their favoured measures to win a slot in the crowded legislative agenda .
a cabinet committee - which includes the leaders of the commons and lords , the chief whip and chief law officers - helps decide on its content , with the prime minister having the final say .
the limited parliamentary timetable - and the time it takes for large bills to pass through examination by committees in the commons and lords - usually means that not all desired measures can be included .
but delaying keynote measures can create its own difficulties , with late bills in danger of running into the parliamentary buffers of the end of the session .
bills which fail to pass through all their parliamentary stages by this point fall , and have to be reintroduced from scratch in the next session .
in this case there are at least three bills being carried over - including the corporate manslaughter and crossrail bills .
what can go wrong ?
although the government controls the parliamentary timetable through its majority in the house of commons , several factors can derail or change its plans .
first of all , the house of lords - whether or not it has a government majority - can reject government bills , sending them back for review to the house of commons .
although the government can reverse lords decisions , the time it takes to do this can slow down progress on other parts of its programme .
in addition , the opposition can seek to delay measures .
this is a tactic which can only be effective when the government has a small and unstable majority and is unable to use its " guillotine " to cut off further debate .
and the government 's own backbenchers might seek to defeat the government on certain unpopular measures .
in addition to the plans set out in the queen 's speech , the government might agree to add extra bills - including those proposed by private members who come high on an annual ballot each year - to its own programme .

the queen 's speech begins the new session of parliament written by the government and delivered by the reigning monarch , the queen 's speech sets out the legislative agenda for the year ahead and is the centrepiece of the state opening of parliament .
each session of parliament begins with this royal address , and usually takes place in november , and covers the following year .
the ceremonial trappings surrounding the speech make the event one of the high points of the parliamentary calendar , unrivalled in its spectacle and tradition despite some of the more arcane practices having been toned down in recent years .
the queen normally attends in person at the state opening of parliament and delivers the speech from the grand throne in the house of lords .
her speech does not set out the entirety of the government 's programme , however .
the budget , and its recent addition the pre-budget report , have also been increasingly used to set out strategy and announce new measures .
final say the decision over what to put in or leave out of the queen 's speech is a politically crucial one , usually the subject of months of political wrangling within government as ministers and lobby groups fight for their favoured measures to win a slot in the crowded legislative agenda .
a cabinet committee - which includes the leaders of the commons and lords , the chief whip and chief law officers - helps decide on its content , with the prime minister having the final say .
the limited parliamentary timetable - and the time it takes for large bills to pass through examination by committees in the commons and lords - usually means that not all desired measures can be included .
but delaying keynote measures can create its own difficulties , with late bills in danger of running into the parliamentary buffers of the end of the session .
bills which fail to pass through all their parliamentary stages by this point fall , and have to be reintroduced from scratch in the next session .
in this case there are at least three bills being carried over - including the corporate manslaughter and crossrail bills .
what can go wrong ?
although the government controls the parliamentary timetable through its majority in the house of commons , several factors can derail or change its plans .
first of all , the house of lords - whether or not it has a government majority - can reject government bills , sending them back for review to the house of commons .
although the government can reverse lords decisions , the time it takes to do this can slow down progress on other parts of its programme .
in addition , the opposition can seek to delay measures .
this is a tactic which can only be effective when the government has a small and unstable majority and is unable to use its " guillotine " to cut off further debate .
and the government 's own backbenchers might seek to defeat the government on certain unpopular measures .
in addition to the plans set out in the queen 's speech , the government might agree to add extra bills - including those proposed by private members who come high on an annual ballot each year - to its own programme .

although the government controls the parliamentary timetable through its majority in the house of commons , several factors can derail or change its plans .
first of all , the house of lords - whether or not it has a government majority - can reject government bills , sending them back for review to the house of commons .
although the government can reverse lords decisions , the time it takes to do this can slow down progress on other parts of its programme .
in addition , the opposition can seek to delay measures .
this is a tactic which can only be effective when the government has a small and unstable majority and is unable to use its " guillotine " to cut off further debate .
and the government 's own backbenchers might seek to defeat the government on certain unpopular measures .
in addition to the plans set out in the queen 's speech , the government might agree to add extra bills - including those proposed by private members who come high on an annual ballot each year - to its own programme .

" i have to cross the main road to get to the post office and you have to take your life in your own hands .
" in the 1930s there were four cars in the village .
a few years ago the traffic volume was 2,000 an hour and that 's increased by 5 % . "
parish council clerk berni yeatman said : " the village ca n't wait .
" we are very excited and we are hoping that within 18 months we shall be driving on the new road . "
terry copplestone , whose family owns the looe mills eating house which is being demolished to make way for the bypass , said : " it 's very sad .
" there was no need really .
they should have found a way to get round it without having to take this down . "
the family was paid compensation two years ago , but mr copplestone said : " money is not everything .
it 's nice to have but there is more to life . "
