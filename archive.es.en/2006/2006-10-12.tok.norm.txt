dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .
that is because india 's trade is very diverse .
it 's divided almost equally between the usa , europe and asia .
bilateral free trade agreements are therefore not particularly attractive to india . " a popular partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the largest player in the global offshore call center business india is nowadays a much sought after partner .
it is seen not only as an upcoming booming economic power , but also as a country beaming with political self-confidence .
india counts as a reliable partner and , as a regional power , it is a guarantor of stability in southeast asia . during his visit last year to the indian subcontinent in march , us president george w. bush de facto recognized india as a nuclear power .
together with germany , brazil and japan , india has been seeking a permanent seat on the un security council .
and , according to christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs , india 's influence on the world stage has actually increased over the past few years . " india has been increasingly trying for several years to play the role of a major power , " wagner said .
" this type of policy has been recognized by the international community .

but the two asian giants are very different from each other . " i think that many companies have discovered that they can do good business in india , " wagner said .
" in addition , india has some advantages over china as far as the legal system and the pervasiveness of the english language are concerned . " on the other hand , there are problems with its infrastructure , " he added .
" i think china is ahead of india there .
another aspect is that the high-level service sector is important in india , whereas processing industries play an important role in china . " within the eu , china has one significant advantage over india because it adopted its liberalization policies before india .
politically , however , india is closer to the eu than china is .
according to wagner , democracy is firmly anchored in india and there are no disagreements on the question of human rights . economic pragmatism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's service sector plays an important role in the country 's economy india 's foreign policy , has nonetheless , caused some irritation in europe .
even though india sided with the us and against its traditional friend iran on the question of nuclear energy , and even though india is playing an important role in the restoration of democracy in nepal , its foreign policy has been occasionally determined by unpredictable economic pragmatism . india , for example , signed energy treaties with the internationally outlawed countries such as sudan and myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- . " india has so far pushed its own national interests - such as the energy issue - to the foreground , disregarding the issues of democratization and human rights , which are important to the europeans , " wagner said .

dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .
that is because india 's trade is very diverse .
it 's divided almost equally between the usa , europe and asia .
bilateral free trade agreements are therefore not particularly attractive to india . " a popular partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the largest player in the global offshore call center business india is nowadays a much sought after partner .

india counts as a reliable partner and , as a regional power , it is a guarantor of stability in southeast asia . during his visit last year to the indian subcontinent in march , us president george w. bush de facto recognized india as a nuclear power .
together with germany , brazil and japan , india has been seeking a permanent seat on the un security council .
and , according to christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs , india 's influence on the world stage has actually increased over the past few years . " india has been increasingly trying for several years to play the role of a major power , " wagner said .
" this type of policy has been recognized by the international community .

" in addition , india has some advantages over china as far as the legal system and the pervasiveness of the english language are concerned . " on the other hand , there are problems with its infrastructure , " he added .
" i think china is ahead of india there .
another aspect is that the high-level service sector is important in india , whereas processing industries play an important role in china . " within the eu , china has one significant advantage over india because it adopted its liberalization policies before india .
politically , however , india is closer to the eu than china is .
according to wagner , democracy is firmly anchored in india and there are no disagreements on the question of human rights . economic pragmatism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's service sector plays an important role in the country 's economy india 's foreign policy , has nonetheless , caused some irritation in europe .
even though india sided with the us and against its traditional friend iran on the question of nuclear energy , and even though india is playing an important role in the restoration of democracy in nepal , its foreign policy has been occasionally determined by unpredictable economic pragmatism . india , for example , signed energy treaties with the internationally outlawed countries such as sudan and myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- . " india has so far pushed its own national interests - such as the energy issue - to the foreground , disregarding the issues of democratization and human rights , which are important to the europeans , " wagner said .

11 hijackers . germany 's highest court begins hearing the appeal of mounir el motassadeq thursday .
the court will determine whether the 32-year-old moroccan knew enough about the plans of the sept .
11 hijackers to be considered the member of a terrorist group . motassadeq lives in hamburg and was part of a circle that included mohamed atta and two of the other hijackers that carried out the suicide attacks in the us .

11 attacks ?
in 2003 , a court in the northern city of hamburg determined that motassadeq had plotted holy war with fellow muslim extremists .
motassadeq was sentenced to 15 years in jail for the murder of more than 3,000 people in the attacks in new york and washington , making him the first person convicted for his alleged role in the attacks . but the verdict was overturned in march 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow questioning of top al qaeda suspects held in american custody . a retrial found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the attacks , but he was still sentenced to seven years in jail for belonging to a terrorist organization .
in a surprise move , germany 's constitutional court released motassadeq from prison in february pending his appeal . a friend of terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several courts have heard the case against motassadeq motassadeq 's defense team believes they can prove that while motassadeq was a friend of the terrorists , he himself was not a member of a terrorist organization . " we believe we can convince the court that the decision was unjust and should be overturned , " said motassadeq 's lawyer ladislav anisic . a decision by germany 's highest court of appeals is likely to take several weeks and will focus on complicated legal questions .

the case has horrified germans and caused political fallout , as the child was supposed to be in state custody when he died . police are investigating how a two-year-old bremen boy 's body ended up stuffed in three trashbags in his father 's fridge .
the case has caused outrage in germany and raised serious questions about the effectiveness of the country 's child welfare system . a family court had recently ordered that the boy - identified only as kevin - be taken away from his 41-year-old father , a heroin addict known for his violent outbursts . but when welfare officials and the police went to fetch kevin on tuesday , it was already too late .
police found the child 's corpse in the refrigerator . " kevin was under the guardianship of the state .

according to state prosecutors , he faces charges of manslaughter and abuse of a minor .
he is also under investigation in connection with the death last year of the boy 's mother , who was also a drug user . there have been at least half-a-dozen cases in the last six years where parents in germany have been charged or sentenced to prison terms for causing the death of their children by neglect .

eu officials do have to worry about human trafficking , drug smuggling and the like , but what they 're really miffed about these days is garlic .
imports are coming in from china evading import duties .
it must be stopped . the little white bulbs have become such a problem in the eu that a special seminar was held in the austrian town of pörtschach , where officials laid out the many devious ways in which unscrupulous traffickers of garlic from china got their wares into the eu illegally . for fresh garlic from china , the world 's largest garlic producer , the eu has an annual quota of 13,000 tons .
above that , the eu slaps an import duty of 9.6 percent on shipments .
that does n't sit well with some producers , who 'd rather not pay , so they have come up with a way to evade the charge . countries who have preferential trade deals with the eu , there are no restrictions on trade volume and duties do n't have to be paid , given that the fresh garlic originates in a country with such a deal .
so smugglers simply ship the garlic into a country such as myanmar , serbia or bulgaria , disguise the product 's origin , and get out of paying the import duties . the eu did n't say how widespread the problem is , but said one container with 20 tons of fresh garlic smuggled successfully into the eu could provide a profit of 24,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,170 -rrb- by evading the import duties . another tactic : fresh garlic is sometimes misdeclared as elephant garlic , which just has one clove , and is therefore exempt from import restrictions . it seems the smugglers ' audacity knows no bounds . but olaf , the eu 's anti-fraud unit , is on the case .
besides conducting the garlic seminar , staff members have extensively analyzed all world trade flows of chinese garlic and developed new intelligence tools for a more efficient fight against this growing scourge . " the fight goes on , " said olaf in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de botching the booty in bergen consulting a map sometimes comes in quite handy , especially when trying to smuggle large quantities of illegal substances across europe , as one woman recently found out on germany 's largest island .

eu officials do have to worry about human trafficking , drug smuggling and the like , but what they 're really miffed about these days is garlic .
imports are coming in from china evading import duties .

above that , the eu slaps an import duty of 9.6 percent on shipments .
that does n't sit well with some producers , who 'd rather not pay , so they have come up with a way to evade the charge . countries who have preferential trade deals with the eu , there are no restrictions on trade volume and duties do n't have to be paid , given that the fresh garlic originates in a country with such a deal .
so smugglers simply ship the garlic into a country such as myanmar , serbia or bulgaria , disguise the product 's origin , and get out of paying the import duties . the eu did n't say how widespread the problem is , but said one container with 20 tons of fresh garlic smuggled successfully into the eu could provide a profit of 24,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,170 -rrb- by evading the import duties . another tactic : fresh garlic is sometimes misdeclared as elephant garlic , which just has one clove , and is therefore exempt from import restrictions . it seems the smugglers ' audacity knows no bounds . but olaf , the eu 's anti-fraud unit , is on the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 12.10.2006 turkish author orhan pamuk wins nobel literature prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has raised rankles among some turks turkish writer orhan pamuk , the author of " my name is red " and " snow , " won the 2006 nobel literature prize , the swedish academy announced on thursday . the jury said pamuk " in the quest for the melancholic soul of his native city -lrb- istanbul -rrb- has discovered new symbols for the clash and interlacing of cultures . " the 54-year-old writer is turkey 's best-known author at home and abroad , but also a straight-talking rebel whose views on his country 's history have caused a storm both at home and abroad .
recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk writes with a passion about his hometown , istanbul the charges were dropped early in 2006 , but the damage had been done .
death threats followed , and a provincial official even ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books - a move nullified by the government , touchy on rights issues as it strives to make turkey a full member of the european union . torn between his political dissidence and his desire to see turkey in the eu , pamuk said he was irked to see the country 's many opponents in europe using his court case to argue against turkey 's membership . the country 's decades-old attempts to become fully european , accompanied by clashes between islam and secularism and tradition and modernity , and the often painful social and psychological impact of the aggressive westernization that followed the collapse of the ottoman empire , form the core of pamuk 's writing .
turkey 's best-selling author born on june 7 , 1952 into a wealthy , westernized family , pamuk gave up architecture studies at the age of 23 and devoted himself to writing .

recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .

" the 54-year-old writer is turkey 's best-known author at home and abroad , but also a straight-talking rebel whose views on his country 's history have caused a storm both at home and abroad .
recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk writes with a passion about his hometown , istanbul the charges were dropped early in 2006 , but the damage had been done .
death threats followed , and a provincial official even ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books - a move nullified by the government , touchy on rights issues as it strives to make turkey a full member of the european union . torn between his political dissidence and his desire to see turkey in the eu , pamuk said he was irked to see the country 's many opponents in europe using his court case to argue against turkey 's membership . the country 's decades-old attempts to become fully european , accompanied by clashes between islam and secularism and tradition and modernity , and the often painful social and psychological impact of the aggressive westernization that followed the collapse of the ottoman empire , form the core of pamuk 's writing .
turkey 's best-selling author born on june 7 , 1952 into a wealthy , westernized family , pamuk gave up architecture studies at the age of 23 and devoted himself to writing .
he published his prize-winning first novel , " cevdet bey and his sons , " seven years later . pamuk mostly shuns the public eye , chain-smoking and writing for long hours in an istanbul flat overlooking the bridge over the bosphorus linking europe and asia .
often casually dressed with jacket over t-shirt , his boyish appearance offset by graying hair and thick glasses , pamuk talks a mile a minute , the words spilling out in bursts as he grimaces and gesticulates .

" in addition , older persons should be able to work longer , said spidla . according to estimates provided by the commissioner , the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- will shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , even taking into account 1.8 million immigrating into the eu every year . by 2050 , the loss of workers is estimated to come to as many as 48 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment , social affairs and equal opportunities commissioner " if we do nothing , two workers have to pay for every retiree , " he said , referring to the current system in which pension plans are supported by payroll contributions made by workers . economic and currency commissioner joaquin almunia called on governments to develop sustainable social models .

" therefore , the number of people wanting to adopt shrinks along with the number of children up for adoption . " whether the declining interest in adoption is also a consequence of artificial insemination could not be determined by the statistics office due to a lack of data . of those adopted last year , around 40 percent are younger than six years of age ; 30 percent were between six and eleven ; and 30 percent were older than 12 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aging germany seeks to prevent a grayer future germany is getting older , but gray hair and wrinkles are the least of its worries .

" i 'm not ruling anything out at present , " merkel said in response to speculation the german government would acquire a direct stake in eads .
" the necessary decisions would be made " so that the german commitment to airbus and to eads , as was the case in the past , would also be clear in the future , " she said , at the end of a franco-german ministerial meeting . " the most important thing is that we get long-term reliable investors who feel bound to the project , " she added . airbus delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo have catapulted eads into the worst crisis in the company 's history .
the problems are expected to cost the firm billions , and have led it to draft plans for massive restructuring that could result in lay-offs or factory closures . hamburg mayor ole von beust , who has a big airbus plant based in his city , had said earlier thursday that merkel and the rest of her government had decided germany would buy shares in eads that daimlerchrysler has said it would like to part with .
jumping the gun " it 's certain that the shares will be bought .
but the arrangements ... are still being drawn up , " von beust told a news conference held with new airbus chief executive louis gallois .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restructuring at airbus is unavoidable daimlerchrysler owns 22.5 percent of eads and has said it wants to reduce its stake to 15 percent .
a spokesman said the company would only sell the shares in accord with the german government , reuters reported . the french state holds 15 percent of the shares in eads .
the french media group lagardere owns 15 percent but is reportedly set to sell half .
merkel said participation in eads by the russian state was not on the agenda , though the state-owned bank vneshtorgbank acquired a 5.02 percent stake in september and kremlin officials signaled that russia could seek influence as a minority shareholder . the price of shares in eads gained 2.81 percent to 21.61 euros after merkel 's comments . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus crisis dominates franco-german talks the crisis at airbus is at the top of the agenda in talks between french and german ministers in paris .

dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .
that is because india 's trade is very diverse .
it 's divided almost equally between the usa , europe and asia .
bilateral free trade agreements are therefore not particularly attractive to india . " a popular partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the largest player in the global offshore call center business india is nowadays a much sought after partner .

india counts as a reliable partner and , as a regional power , it is a guarantor of stability in southeast asia . during his visit last year to the indian subcontinent in march , us president george w. bush de facto recognized india as a nuclear power .
together with germany , brazil and japan , india has been seeking a permanent seat on the un security council .
and , according to christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs , india 's influence on the world stage has actually increased over the past few years . " india has been increasingly trying for several years to play the role of a major power , " wagner said .
" this type of policy has been recognized by the international community .

" in addition , india has some advantages over china as far as the legal system and the pervasiveness of the english language are concerned . " on the other hand , there are problems with its infrastructure , " he added .
" i think china is ahead of india there .
another aspect is that the high-level service sector is important in india , whereas processing industries play an important role in china . " within the eu , china has one significant advantage over india because it adopted its liberalization policies before india .
politically , however , india is closer to the eu than china is .
according to wagner , democracy is firmly anchored in india and there are no disagreements on the question of human rights . economic pragmatism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's service sector plays an important role in the country 's economy india 's foreign policy , has nonetheless , caused some irritation in europe .
even though india sided with the us and against its traditional friend iran on the question of nuclear energy , and even though india is playing an important role in the restoration of democracy in nepal , its foreign policy has been occasionally determined by unpredictable economic pragmatism . india , for example , signed energy treaties with the internationally outlawed countries such as sudan and myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- . " india has so far pushed its own national interests - such as the energy issue - to the foreground , disregarding the issues of democratization and human rights , which are important to the europeans , " wagner said .
" india 's foreign policy is still not animated with the thought of democratic changes , which is what europeans would like to see .

dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .
that is because india 's trade is very diverse .
it 's divided almost equally between the usa , europe and asia .
bilateral free trade agreements are therefore not particularly attractive to india . " a popular partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the largest player in the global offshore call center business india is nowadays a much sought after partner .
it is seen not only as an upcoming booming economic power , but also as a country beaming with political self-confidence .
india counts as a reliable partner and , as a regional power , it is a guarantor of stability in southeast asia . during his visit last year to the indian subcontinent in march , us president george w. bush de facto recognized india as a nuclear power .
together with germany , brazil and japan , india has been seeking a permanent seat on the un security council .
and , according to christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs , india 's influence on the world stage has actually increased over the past few years . " india has been increasingly trying for several years to play the role of a major power , " wagner said .
" this type of policy has been recognized by the international community .

german chancellor angela merkel will also bring up the issue when she meets with french president jacques chirac . germany is concerned that the restructuring of the problem-wracked european aircraft maker could result in lay-offs at the country 's airbus production factories . " the government will employ all its powers for the german sites .
we will watch closely that possible burdens are fairly distributed , " said economics minister michael glos ahead of the talks . sources close to the french president jacques chirac said the extent and location of any cutbacks now depended on talks by new management at airbus , a subsidiary of eads , according to news agency afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg-finkenwerder site is airbus ' biggest in germany the sole objective was to " correct structural faults , " a spokesman for chirac said . ratings agency standard and poor 's meanwhile lowered its corporate credit ratings on eads , saying it was concerned about the european aerospace group 's management and its ability to meet organizational and competitive challenges .
gallois reassures germans louis gallois , co-chief executive of eads and the new head of aircraft maker airbus , was due to visit airbus ' factory in hamburg on thursday .
in an interview , he sought to reassure germany that it would not have to bear the brunt of group restructuring . when it came to the decisions as to where and how costs would be cut , fairness and an equal distribution between the countries where airbus sites were situated would be taken into consideration , gallois told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois has tried to sooth the germans " i do n't believe , for example , that you can ask germans to pay for the french or vice versa , " the chief executive said . eads has said the rescue plan drafted by former ceo christian steiff , who was replaced by gallois on monday , will be implemented , although three months would be needed to work out the details .
the problems would cut its cash flow by 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- over four years , excluding any new problems , the concern said last week . airbus aims to cut administrative costs by 30 percent and boost productivity by 20 percent over the next four years . germany is particularly concerned that the hamburg site might be targeted , since some of the problems in the delays in the group 's a380 superjumbo have been traced to that plant . but gallois was reassuring . " if hamburg has lengthened the take-off and landing runways of its airport " in order to cope with the a380 , " that could not be ignored , gallois said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany likely hit by airbus restructuring steering the troubled aircraft manufacturer airbus back on course will likely require restructuring and job cuts , its new ceo warned .

the case has horrified germans and caused political fallout , as the child was supposed to be in state custody when he died . police are investigating how a two-year-old bremen boy 's body ended up stuffed in three trashbags in his father 's fridge .
the case has caused outrage in germany and raised serious questions about the effectiveness of the country 's child welfare system . a family court had recently ordered that the boy - identified only as kevin - be taken away from his 41-year-old father , a heroin addict known for his violent outbursts . but when welfare officials and the police went to fetch kevin on tuesday , it was already too late .

eu officials do have to worry about human trafficking , drug smuggling and the like , but what they 're really miffed about these days is garlic .
imports are coming in from china evading import duties .

above that , the eu slaps an import duty of 9.6 percent on shipments .
that does n't sit well with some producers , who 'd rather not pay , so they have come up with a way to evade the charge . countries who have preferential trade deals with the eu , there are no restrictions on trade volume and duties do n't have to be paid , given that the fresh garlic originates in a country with such a deal .
so smugglers simply ship the garlic into a country such as myanmar , serbia or bulgaria , disguise the product 's origin , and get out of paying the import duties . the eu did n't say how widespread the problem is , but said one container with 20 tons of fresh garlic smuggled successfully into the eu could provide a profit of 24,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,170 -rrb- by evading the import duties . another tactic : fresh garlic is sometimes misdeclared as elephant garlic , which just has one clove , and is therefore exempt from import restrictions . it seems the smugglers ' audacity knows no bounds . but olaf , the eu 's anti-fraud unit , is on the case .

" the 54-year-old writer is turkey 's best-known author at home and abroad , but also a straight-talking rebel whose views on his country 's history have caused a storm both at home and abroad .
recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .

death threats followed , and a provincial official even ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books - a move nullified by the government , touchy on rights issues as it strives to make turkey a full member of the european union . torn between his political dissidence and his desire to see turkey in the eu , pamuk said he was irked to see the country 's many opponents in europe using his court case to argue against turkey 's membership . the country 's decades-old attempts to become fully european , accompanied by clashes between islam and secularism and tradition and modernity , and the often painful social and psychological impact of the aggressive westernization that followed the collapse of the ottoman empire , form the core of pamuk 's writing .
turkey 's best-selling author born on june 7 , 1952 into a wealthy , westernized family , pamuk gave up architecture studies at the age of 23 and devoted himself to writing .
he published his prize-winning first novel , " cevdet bey and his sons , " seven years later . pamuk mostly shuns the public eye , chain-smoking and writing for long hours in an istanbul flat overlooking the bridge over the bosphorus linking europe and asia .
often casually dressed with jacket over t-shirt , his boyish appearance offset by graying hair and thick glasses , pamuk talks a mile a minute , the words spilling out in bursts as he grimaces and gesticulates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was awarded the german book trade 's peace prize in 2005 he first drew the ire of the state in the mid-1990s when he denounced the treatment of the kurdish minority as the army waged a heavy-handed campaign to suppress a bloody separatist insurgency in the southeast . the government extended an olive branch in 1998 , offering him the accolade of " artist of the state , " but pamuk rejected the honor .
by then , he had become the country 's best-selling author .

" the 54-year-old writer is turkey 's best-known author at home and abroad , but also a straight-talking rebel whose views on his country 's history have caused a storm both at home and abroad .
recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk writes with a passion about his hometown , istanbul the charges were dropped early in 2006 , but the damage had been done .
death threats followed , and a provincial official even ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books - a move nullified by the government , touchy on rights issues as it strives to make turkey a full member of the european union . torn between his political dissidence and his desire to see turkey in the eu , pamuk said he was irked to see the country 's many opponents in europe using his court case to argue against turkey 's membership . the country 's decades-old attempts to become fully european , accompanied by clashes between islam and secularism and tradition and modernity , and the often painful social and psychological impact of the aggressive westernization that followed the collapse of the ottoman empire , form the core of pamuk 's writing .
turkey 's best-selling author born on june 7 , 1952 into a wealthy , westernized family , pamuk gave up architecture studies at the age of 23 and devoted himself to writing .
he published his prize-winning first novel , " cevdet bey and his sons , " seven years later . pamuk mostly shuns the public eye , chain-smoking and writing for long hours in an istanbul flat overlooking the bridge over the bosphorus linking europe and asia .
often casually dressed with jacket over t-shirt , his boyish appearance offset by graying hair and thick glasses , pamuk talks a mile a minute , the words spilling out in bursts as he grimaces and gesticulates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was awarded the german book trade 's peace prize in 2005 he first drew the ire of the state in the mid-1990s when he denounced the treatment of the kurdish minority as the army waged a heavy-handed campaign to suppress a bloody separatist insurgency in the southeast . the government extended an olive branch in 1998 , offering him the accolade of " artist of the state , " but pamuk rejected the honor .
by then , he had become the country 's best-selling author .
his sixth novel , " my name is red , " brought him international fame and a slew of awards . his books , translated into 32 languages , are : " cevdet bey and his sons " -lrb- 1982 -rrb- , " the silent house " -lrb- 1983 -rrb- , " the white castle " -lrb- 1985 -rrb- , " the black book " -lrb- 1990 -rrb- , " the new life " -lrb- 1994 -rrb- , " my name is red " -lrb- 1998 -rrb- , " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- and " istanbul " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- . pamuk 's name was among the frontrunners rumored to win this year 's prize .

i feel for germany .
with france and russia as best friends , one does n't need any enemies . - wiley horne , usa it is sad to see an aviation project like the a380 suffer , but it suffers due to a misled strategy based on bringing france -lrb- germany , and the eu as a whole -rrb- the glory of producing the " world 's largest passenger plane . "
surpassing the b747 in size , endurance , comfort , economy plus large hub-to-hub transport may have been justifications to the market , but the underlying motivations may just have been the challenge to feel the glory .
we all remember the other major project , concorde .

" in addition , older persons should be able to work longer , said spidla . according to estimates provided by the commissioner , the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- will shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , even taking into account 1.8 million immigrating into the eu every year . by 2050 , the loss of workers is estimated to come to as many as 48 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment , social affairs and equal opportunities commissioner " if we do nothing , two workers have to pay for every retiree , " he said , referring to the current system in which pension plans are supported by payroll contributions made by workers . economic and currency commissioner joaquin almunia called on governments to develop sustainable social models .

" therefore , the number of people wanting to adopt shrinks along with the number of children up for adoption . " whether the declining interest in adoption is also a consequence of artificial insemination could not be determined by the statistics office due to a lack of data . of those adopted last year , around 40 percent are younger than six years of age ; 30 percent were between six and eleven ; and 30 percent were older than 12 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aging germany seeks to prevent a grayer future germany is getting older , but gray hair and wrinkles are the least of its worries .

" the 54-year-old writer is turkey 's best-known author at home and abroad , but also a straight-talking rebel whose views on his country 's history have caused a storm both at home and abroad .
recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk writes with a passion about his hometown , istanbul the charges were dropped early in 2006 , but the damage had been done .
death threats followed , and a provincial official even ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books - a move nullified by the government , touchy on rights issues as it strives to make turkey a full member of the european union . torn between his political dissidence and his desire to see turkey in the eu , pamuk said he was irked to see the country 's many opponents in europe using his court case to argue against turkey 's membership . the country 's decades-old attempts to become fully european , accompanied by clashes between islam and secularism and tradition and modernity , and the often painful social and psychological impact of the aggressive westernization that followed the collapse of the ottoman empire , form the core of pamuk 's writing .
turkey 's best-selling author born on june 7 , 1952 into a wealthy , westernized family , pamuk gave up architecture studies at the age of 23 and devoted himself to writing .
he published his prize-winning first novel , " cevdet bey and his sons , " seven years later . pamuk mostly shuns the public eye , chain-smoking and writing for long hours in an istanbul flat overlooking the bridge over the bosphorus linking europe and asia .
often casually dressed with jacket over t-shirt , his boyish appearance offset by graying hair and thick glasses , pamuk talks a mile a minute , the words spilling out in bursts as he grimaces and gesticulates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was awarded the german book trade 's peace prize in 2005 he first drew the ire of the state in the mid-1990s when he denounced the treatment of the kurdish minority as the army waged a heavy-handed campaign to suppress a bloody separatist insurgency in the southeast . the government extended an olive branch in 1998 , offering him the accolade of " artist of the state , " but pamuk rejected the honor .
by then , he had become the country 's best-selling author .
his sixth novel , " my name is red , " brought him international fame and a slew of awards . his books , translated into 32 languages , are : " cevdet bey and his sons " -lrb- 1982 -rrb- , " the silent house " -lrb- 1983 -rrb- , " the white castle " -lrb- 1985 -rrb- , " the black book " -lrb- 1990 -rrb- , " the new life " -lrb- 1994 -rrb- , " my name is red " -lrb- 1998 -rrb- , " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- and " istanbul " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- . pamuk 's name was among the frontrunners rumored to win this year 's prize .

" the 54-year-old writer is turkey 's best-known author at home and abroad , but also a straight-talking rebel whose views on his country 's history have caused a storm both at home and abroad .
recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk writes with a passion about his hometown , istanbul the charges were dropped early in 2006 , but the damage had been done .
death threats followed , and a provincial official even ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books - a move nullified by the government , touchy on rights issues as it strives to make turkey a full member of the european union . torn between his political dissidence and his desire to see turkey in the eu , pamuk said he was irked to see the country 's many opponents in europe using his court case to argue against turkey 's membership . the country 's decades-old attempts to become fully european , accompanied by clashes between islam and secularism and tradition and modernity , and the often painful social and psychological impact of the aggressive westernization that followed the collapse of the ottoman empire , form the core of pamuk 's writing .
turkey 's best-selling author born on june 7 , 1952 into a wealthy , westernized family , pamuk gave up architecture studies at the age of 23 and devoted himself to writing .
he published his prize-winning first novel , " cevdet bey and his sons , " seven years later . pamuk mostly shuns the public eye , chain-smoking and writing for long hours in an istanbul flat overlooking the bridge over the bosphorus linking europe and asia .
often casually dressed with jacket over t-shirt , his boyish appearance offset by graying hair and thick glasses , pamuk talks a mile a minute , the words spilling out in bursts as he grimaces and gesticulates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was awarded the german book trade 's peace prize in 2005 he first drew the ire of the state in the mid-1990s when he denounced the treatment of the kurdish minority as the army waged a heavy-handed campaign to suppress a bloody separatist insurgency in the southeast . the government extended an olive branch in 1998 , offering him the accolade of " artist of the state , " but pamuk rejected the honor .
by then , he had become the country 's best-selling author .
his sixth novel , " my name is red , " brought him international fame and a slew of awards . his books , translated into 32 languages , are : " cevdet bey and his sons " -lrb- 1982 -rrb- , " the silent house " -lrb- 1983 -rrb- , " the white castle " -lrb- 1985 -rrb- , " the black book " -lrb- 1990 -rrb- , " the new life " -lrb- 1994 -rrb- , " my name is red " -lrb- 1998 -rrb- , " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- and " istanbul " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- . pamuk 's name was among the frontrunners rumored to win this year 's prize .
he will take home the prize sum of 10 million kronor -lrb- 1.07 million euros , $ 1.37 million -rrb- . last year , the honor went to british playwright harold pinter . pamuk will receive the nobel prize , which consists of money , a gold medal and a diploma , from sweden 's king carl xvi gustaf at a formal ceremony in stockholm on dec .

" in addition , older persons should be able to work longer , said spidla . according to estimates provided by the commissioner , the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- will shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , even taking into account 1.8 million immigrating into the eu every year . by 2050 , the loss of workers is estimated to come to as many as 48 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment , social affairs and equal opportunities commissioner " if we do nothing , two workers have to pay for every retiree , " he said , referring to the current system in which pension plans are supported by payroll contributions made by workers . economic and currency commissioner joaquin almunia called on governments to develop sustainable social models .
among eu countries , germany has some of the bloc 's highest pension costs . population issue in all decisions authorities in brussels plan , from now on , to take the issue of demographic development into consideration when drafting new policies .
in addition , every two years a demographic forum will compile information on population development from eu member states .
concrete legal regulations regarding the issue , however , are not planned at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors working longer would also please the eu the announcement also spoke of allowing people over the age of 65 to participate longer in economic and social life .
according to spidla , the goal of keeping older workers on the jobs longer does in no way contribute to high youth employment in many eu states . " there is no study that says that young people stand in competition with older ones on the job market , " he said .
" these are two different things . " fewer adoptions in germany while europeans in general are having fewer children , germans are also adopting fewer of them .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden reported on thursday that last year , some 4,800 children were adopted , about half as many as in 1993 . the number of adoptive parents has been decreasing for years .
while at the end of 1993 almost 22,000 couples were on waiting lists for adoptive children , at the end of last year that number was 9,300 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adoption is not as common as it once was johannes vocks , the head of the adoption center in frankfurt , said that one can only speculate about the exact reasons behind the decline . " the birth rate has been sinking for years and the population is growing smaller , " he told ap news agency .
" therefore , the number of people wanting to adopt shrinks along with the number of children up for adoption . " whether the declining interest in adoption is also a consequence of artificial insemination could not be determined by the statistics office due to a lack of data . of those adopted last year , around 40 percent are younger than six years of age ; 30 percent were between six and eleven ; and 30 percent were older than 12 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aging germany seeks to prevent a grayer future germany is getting older , but gray hair and wrinkles are the least of its worries .

i feel for germany .
with france and russia as best friends , one does n't need any enemies . - wiley horne , usa it is sad to see an aviation project like the a380 suffer , but it suffers due to a misled strategy based on bringing france -lrb- germany , and the eu as a whole -rrb- the glory of producing the " world 's largest passenger plane . "
surpassing the b747 in size , endurance , comfort , economy plus large hub-to-hub transport may have been justifications to the market , but the underlying motivations may just have been the challenge to feel the glory .
we all remember the other major project , concorde .
it was built and flown not for profit , but for glory .
will the a380 be the eu 's second concorde ?
as it is already in flight test , it would be impossibly embarrassing to discontinue the a380 and focus long term on non-glorifying mid-sized -lrb- a350 -rrb- and smaller jets -lrb- a32x -rrb- .
if governments were not stockholders in eads it just might be possible to " bite the bullet " and cancel the a380 , forget the glory and get to the business of making a profit . - rodney lee , usa of course , the german government should get involved .
these things are much too big to rely on the market and its sometimes quirky outcomes . - ed mueller now we see the difference between a company like boeing , which has to actually make a profit in the private sector to survive , and airbus , which until recently could just build and sell its planes regardless of loss because sponsoring governments would simply make up the difference .
welcome to the market , airbus . - jl ronish the multinational airbus company is a bureaucrat 's heaven !
a purge on wasted effort is long overdue . - ted , uk i am surprised about the statement that the two year delay of the a380 is due to wiring problems and to the software learning process of said wiring task .
the real problem lays , as it is even partially visible from your own articles , in other far more serious issues , such as extreme design mistakes due to a lack of organization " 10 years or more " behind boeing , lack of experience in very large aircrafts , a feuding multinational management and , last but not least , the political pressure of mainly the french government , blinded by its inferiority complex versus the usa .
and if this possibly fatal mistake is compounded by abandoning the much larger middle-size market , already hurt by the ongoing a350 mismanagement , all the billions spent by the european governments in legal , but often illegal , subsidies to support sale prices below cost will be lost , and airbus -lrb- will -rrb- enter history as one of the biggest flops recorded . - otto tisch , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany likely hit by airbus restructuring steering the troubled aircraft manufacturer airbus back on course will likely require restructuring and job cuts , its new ceo warned .

slovakia are third with six points from four matches . a small number of german fans was involved in clashes with police during the game and ballack said that it was difficult to say something about such incidents . " one can only say that the team totally distances itself from those people .

i feel for germany .
with france and russia as best friends , one does n't need any enemies . - wiley horne , usa it is sad to see an aviation project like the a380 suffer , but it suffers due to a misled strategy based on bringing france -lrb- germany , and the eu as a whole -rrb- the glory of producing the " world 's largest passenger plane . "
surpassing the b747 in size , endurance , comfort , economy plus large hub-to-hub transport may have been justifications to the market , but the underlying motivations may just have been the challenge to feel the glory .
we all remember the other major project , concorde .
it was built and flown not for profit , but for glory .
will the a380 be the eu 's second concorde ?
as it is already in flight test , it would be impossibly embarrassing to discontinue the a380 and focus long term on non-glorifying mid-sized -lrb- a350 -rrb- and smaller jets -lrb- a32x -rrb- .
if governments were not stockholders in eads it just might be possible to " bite the bullet " and cancel the a380 , forget the glory and get to the business of making a profit . - rodney lee , usa of course , the german government should get involved .
these things are much too big to rely on the market and its sometimes quirky outcomes . - ed mueller now we see the difference between a company like boeing , which has to actually make a profit in the private sector to survive , and airbus , which until recently could just build and sell its planes regardless of loss because sponsoring governments would simply make up the difference .
welcome to the market , airbus . - jl ronish the multinational airbus company is a bureaucrat 's heaven !
a purge on wasted effort is long overdue . - ted , uk i am surprised about the statement that the two year delay of the a380 is due to wiring problems and to the software learning process of said wiring task .
the real problem lays , as it is even partially visible from your own articles , in other far more serious issues , such as extreme design mistakes due to a lack of organization " 10 years or more " behind boeing , lack of experience in very large aircrafts , a feuding multinational management and , last but not least , the political pressure of mainly the french government , blinded by its inferiority complex versus the usa .
and if this possibly fatal mistake is compounded by abandoning the much larger middle-size market , already hurt by the ongoing a350 mismanagement , all the billions spent by the european governments in legal , but often illegal , subsidies to support sale prices below cost will be lost , and airbus -lrb- will -rrb- enter history as one of the biggest flops recorded . - otto tisch , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany likely hit by airbus restructuring steering the troubled aircraft manufacturer airbus back on course will likely require restructuring and job cuts , its new ceo warned .
germany could bear the brunt of any factory organization .
-lrb- 10.10.2006 -rrb- bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm .

they are second behind the czech republic who were held to a 1-1 draw in dublin by ireland .
slovakia are third with six points from four matches . a small number of german fans was involved in clashes with police during the game and ballack said that it was difficult to say something about such incidents . " one can only say that the team totally distances itself from those people .

dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .
that is because india 's trade is very diverse .
it 's divided almost equally between the usa , europe and asia .
bilateral free trade agreements are therefore not particularly attractive to india . " a popular partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the largest player in the global offshore call center business india is nowadays a much sought after partner .

" in addition , india has some advantages over china as far as the legal system and the pervasiveness of the english language are concerned . " on the other hand , there are problems with its infrastructure , " he added .
" i think china is ahead of india there .
another aspect is that the high-level service sector is important in india , whereas processing industries play an important role in china . " within the eu , china has one significant advantage over india because it adopted its liberalization policies before india .
politically , however , india is closer to the eu than china is .
according to wagner , democracy is firmly anchored in india and there are no disagreements on the question of human rights . economic pragmatism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's service sector plays an important role in the country 's economy india 's foreign policy , has nonetheless , caused some irritation in europe .
even though india sided with the us and against its traditional friend iran on the question of nuclear energy , and even though india is playing an important role in the restoration of democracy in nepal , its foreign policy has been occasionally determined by unpredictable economic pragmatism . india , for example , signed energy treaties with the internationally outlawed countries such as sudan and myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- . " india has so far pushed its own national interests - such as the energy issue - to the foreground , disregarding the issues of democratization and human rights , which are important to the europeans , " wagner said .

dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .
that is because india 's trade is very diverse .
it 's divided almost equally between the usa , europe and asia .
bilateral free trade agreements are therefore not particularly attractive to india . " a popular partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the largest player in the global offshore call center business india is nowadays a much sought after partner .
it is seen not only as an upcoming booming economic power , but also as a country beaming with political self-confidence .
india counts as a reliable partner and , as a regional power , it is a guarantor of stability in southeast asia . during his visit last year to the indian subcontinent in march , us president george w. bush de facto recognized india as a nuclear power .
together with germany , brazil and japan , india has been seeking a permanent seat on the un security council .
and , according to christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs , india 's influence on the world stage has actually increased over the past few years . " india has been increasingly trying for several years to play the role of a major power , " wagner said .
" this type of policy has been recognized by the international community .

" i 'm not ruling anything out at present , " merkel said in response to speculation the german government would acquire a direct stake in eads .
" the necessary decisions would be made " so that the german commitment to airbus and to eads , as was the case in the past , would also be clear in the future , " she said , at the end of a franco-german ministerial meeting . " the most important thing is that we get long-term reliable investors who feel bound to the project , " she added . airbus delays in delivering its a380 super jumbo have catapulted eads into the worst crisis in the company 's history .
the problems are expected to cost the firm billions , and have led it to draft plans for massive restructuring that could result in lay-offs or factory closures . hamburg mayor ole von beust , who has a big airbus plant based in his city , had said earlier thursday that merkel and the rest of her government had decided germany would buy shares in eads that daimlerchrysler has said it would like to part with .
jumping the gun " it 's certain that the shares will be bought .
but the arrangements ... are still being drawn up , " von beust told a news conference held with new airbus chief executive louis gallois .

a spokesman said the company would only sell the shares in accord with the german government , reuters reported . the french state holds 15 percent of the shares in eads .
the french media group lagardere owns 15 percent but is reportedly set to sell half .
merkel said participation in eads by the russian state was not on the agenda , though the state-owned bank vneshtorgbank acquired a 5.02 percent stake in september and kremlin officials signaled that russia could seek influence as a minority shareholder . the price of shares in eads gained 2.81 percent to 21.61 euros after merkel 's comments . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus crisis dominates franco-german talks the crisis at airbus is at the top of the agenda in talks between french and german ministers in paris .

german chancellor angela merkel will also bring up the issue when she meets with french president jacques chirac . germany is concerned that the restructuring of the problem-wracked european aircraft maker could result in lay-offs at the country 's airbus production factories . " the government will employ all its powers for the german sites .
we will watch closely that possible burdens are fairly distributed , " said economics minister michael glos ahead of the talks . sources close to the french president jacques chirac said the extent and location of any cutbacks now depended on talks by new management at airbus , a subsidiary of eads , according to news agency afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg-finkenwerder site is airbus ' biggest in germany the sole objective was to " correct structural faults , " a spokesman for chirac said . ratings agency standard and poor 's meanwhile lowered its corporate credit ratings on eads , saying it was concerned about the european aerospace group 's management and its ability to meet organizational and competitive challenges .
gallois reassures germans louis gallois , co-chief executive of eads and the new head of aircraft maker airbus , was due to visit airbus ' factory in hamburg on thursday .
in an interview , he sought to reassure germany that it would not have to bear the brunt of group restructuring . when it came to the decisions as to where and how costs would be cut , fairness and an equal distribution between the countries where airbus sites were situated would be taken into consideration , gallois told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois has tried to sooth the germans " i do n't believe , for example , that you can ask germans to pay for the french or vice versa , " the chief executive said . eads has said the rescue plan drafted by former ceo christian steiff , who was replaced by gallois on monday , will be implemented , although three months would be needed to work out the details .
the problems would cut its cash flow by 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- over four years , excluding any new problems , the concern said last week . airbus aims to cut administrative costs by 30 percent and boost productivity by 20 percent over the next four years . germany is particularly concerned that the hamburg site might be targeted , since some of the problems in the delays in the group 's a380 superjumbo have been traced to that plant . but gallois was reassuring .

the crushing victory was marred by crowd trouble as german fans fought with police . five days after stunning wales 5-1 in cardiff , the slovaks could do nothing against a german onslaught in the opening minutes that saw the visitors race into a two-goal lead after just 25 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw again had reason to celebrate coach joachim löw said that it helped the side settle down by scoring early goals .
" i am very pleased with the way we played our game .
early goals are very important . " three goals in 25 minutes shock slovaks lukas podolski opened the scoring in the 13th minute after being set up by midfielder bernd schneider , who was playing his 75th game for his country .

dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .
that is because india 's trade is very diverse .
it 's divided almost equally between the usa , europe and asia .
bilateral free trade agreements are therefore not particularly attractive to india . " a popular partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the largest player in the global offshore call center business india is nowadays a much sought after partner .
it is seen not only as an upcoming booming economic power , but also as a country beaming with political self-confidence .
india counts as a reliable partner and , as a regional power , it is a guarantor of stability in southeast asia . during his visit last year to the indian subcontinent in march , us president george w. bush de facto recognized india as a nuclear power .
together with germany , brazil and japan , india has been seeking a permanent seat on the un security council .
and , according to christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs , india 's influence on the world stage has actually increased over the past few years . " india has been increasingly trying for several years to play the role of a major power , " wagner said .
" this type of policy has been recognized by the international community .

" in addition , india has some advantages over china as far as the legal system and the pervasiveness of the english language are concerned . " on the other hand , there are problems with its infrastructure , " he added .
" i think china is ahead of india there .
another aspect is that the high-level service sector is important in india , whereas processing industries play an important role in china . " within the eu , china has one significant advantage over india because it adopted its liberalization policies before india .
politically , however , india is closer to the eu than china is .
according to wagner , democracy is firmly anchored in india and there are no disagreements on the question of human rights . economic pragmatism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's service sector plays an important role in the country 's economy india 's foreign policy , has nonetheless , caused some irritation in europe .
even though india sided with the us and against its traditional friend iran on the question of nuclear energy , and even though india is playing an important role in the restoration of democracy in nepal , its foreign policy has been occasionally determined by unpredictable economic pragmatism . india , for example , signed energy treaties with the internationally outlawed countries such as sudan and myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- . " india has so far pushed its own national interests - such as the energy issue - to the foreground , disregarding the issues of democratization and human rights , which are important to the europeans , " wagner said .

dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .
that is because india 's trade is very diverse .
it 's divided almost equally between the usa , europe and asia .
bilateral free trade agreements are therefore not particularly attractive to india . " a popular partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the largest player in the global offshore call center business india is nowadays a much sought after partner .
it is seen not only as an upcoming booming economic power , but also as a country beaming with political self-confidence .
india counts as a reliable partner and , as a regional power , it is a guarantor of stability in southeast asia . during his visit last year to the indian subcontinent in march , us president george w. bush de facto recognized india as a nuclear power .
together with germany , brazil and japan , india has been seeking a permanent seat on the un security council .
and , according to christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs , india 's influence on the world stage has actually increased over the past few years . " india has been increasingly trying for several years to play the role of a major power , " wagner said .
" this type of policy has been recognized by the international community .
the very fact that the eu is conducting these bilateral summits and that it has established a strategic partnership with india highlights india 's increasingly important role as a partner in international relations . " advantages over china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is still struggling with the deficiencies of its infrastructure china - india 's archrival - was for a long time the focus of european attention .

but the two asian giants are very different from each other . " i think that many companies have discovered that they can do good business in india , " wagner said .
" in addition , india has some advantages over china as far as the legal system and the pervasiveness of the english language are concerned . " on the other hand , there are problems with its infrastructure , " he added .
" i think china is ahead of india there .
another aspect is that the high-level service sector is important in india , whereas processing industries play an important role in china . " within the eu , china has one significant advantage over india because it adopted its liberalization policies before india .
politically , however , india is closer to the eu than china is .
according to wagner , democracy is firmly anchored in india and there are no disagreements on the question of human rights . economic pragmatism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's service sector plays an important role in the country 's economy india 's foreign policy , has nonetheless , caused some irritation in europe .
even though india sided with the us and against its traditional friend iran on the question of nuclear energy , and even though india is playing an important role in the restoration of democracy in nepal , its foreign policy has been occasionally determined by unpredictable economic pragmatism . india , for example , signed energy treaties with the internationally outlawed countries such as sudan and myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- . " india has so far pushed its own national interests - such as the energy issue - to the foreground , disregarding the issues of democratization and human rights , which are important to the europeans , " wagner said .

i feel for germany .
with france and russia as best friends , one does n't need any enemies . - wiley horne , usa it is sad to see an aviation project like the a380 suffer , but it suffers due to a misled strategy based on bringing france -lrb- germany , and the eu as a whole -rrb- the glory of producing the " world 's largest passenger plane . "
surpassing the b747 in size , endurance , comfort , economy plus large hub-to-hub transport may have been justifications to the market , but the underlying motivations may just have been the challenge to feel the glory .
we all remember the other major project , concorde .
it was built and flown not for profit , but for glory .
will the a380 be the eu 's second concorde ?
as it is already in flight test , it would be impossibly embarrassing to discontinue the a380 and focus long term on non-glorifying mid-sized -lrb- a350 -rrb- and smaller jets -lrb- a32x -rrb- .
if governments were not stockholders in eads it just might be possible to " bite the bullet " and cancel the a380 , forget the glory and get to the business of making a profit . - rodney lee , usa of course , the german government should get involved .
these things are much too big to rely on the market and its sometimes quirky outcomes . - ed mueller now we see the difference between a company like boeing , which has to actually make a profit in the private sector to survive , and airbus , which until recently could just build and sell its planes regardless of loss because sponsoring governments would simply make up the difference .
welcome to the market , airbus . - jl ronish the multinational airbus company is a bureaucrat 's heaven !
a purge on wasted effort is long overdue . - ted , uk i am surprised about the statement that the two year delay of the a380 is due to wiring problems and to the software learning process of said wiring task .
the real problem lays , as it is even partially visible from your own articles , in other far more serious issues , such as extreme design mistakes due to a lack of organization " 10 years or more " behind boeing , lack of experience in very large aircrafts , a feuding multinational management and , last but not least , the political pressure of mainly the french government , blinded by its inferiority complex versus the usa .
and if this possibly fatal mistake is compounded by abandoning the much larger middle-size market , already hurt by the ongoing a350 mismanagement , all the billions spent by the european governments in legal , but often illegal , subsidies to support sale prices below cost will be lost , and airbus -lrb- will -rrb- enter history as one of the biggest flops recorded . - otto tisch , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany likely hit by airbus restructuring steering the troubled aircraft manufacturer airbus back on course will likely require restructuring and job cuts , its new ceo warned .
germany could bear the brunt of any factory organization .
-lrb- 10.10.2006 -rrb- bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm .

as it is already in flight test , it would be impossibly embarrassing to discontinue the a380 and focus long term on non-glorifying mid-sized -lrb- a350 -rrb- and smaller jets -lrb- a32x -rrb- .
if governments were not stockholders in eads it just might be possible to " bite the bullet " and cancel the a380 , forget the glory and get to the business of making a profit . - rodney lee , usa of course , the german government should get involved .
these things are much too big to rely on the market and its sometimes quirky outcomes . - ed mueller now we see the difference between a company like boeing , which has to actually make a profit in the private sector to survive , and airbus , which until recently could just build and sell its planes regardless of loss because sponsoring governments would simply make up the difference .
welcome to the market , airbus . - jl ronish the multinational airbus company is a bureaucrat 's heaven !
a purge on wasted effort is long overdue . - ted , uk i am surprised about the statement that the two year delay of the a380 is due to wiring problems and to the software learning process of said wiring task .
the real problem lays , as it is even partially visible from your own articles , in other far more serious issues , such as extreme design mistakes due to a lack of organization " 10 years or more " behind boeing , lack of experience in very large aircrafts , a feuding multinational management and , last but not least , the political pressure of mainly the french government , blinded by its inferiority complex versus the usa .
and if this possibly fatal mistake is compounded by abandoning the much larger middle-size market , already hurt by the ongoing a350 mismanagement , all the billions spent by the european governments in legal , but often illegal , subsidies to support sale prices below cost will be lost , and airbus -lrb- will -rrb- enter history as one of the biggest flops recorded . - otto tisch , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany likely hit by airbus restructuring steering the troubled aircraft manufacturer airbus back on course will likely require restructuring and job cuts , its new ceo warned .
germany could bear the brunt of any factory organization .
-lrb- 10.10.2006 -rrb- bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm .

" the 54-year-old writer is turkey 's best-known author at home and abroad , but also a straight-talking rebel whose views on his country 's history have caused a storm both at home and abroad .
recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk writes with a passion about his hometown , istanbul the charges were dropped early in 2006 , but the damage had been done .
death threats followed , and a provincial official even ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books - a move nullified by the government , touchy on rights issues as it strives to make turkey a full member of the european union . torn between his political dissidence and his desire to see turkey in the eu , pamuk said he was irked to see the country 's many opponents in europe using his court case to argue against turkey 's membership . the country 's decades-old attempts to become fully european , accompanied by clashes between islam and secularism and tradition and modernity , and the often painful social and psychological impact of the aggressive westernization that followed the collapse of the ottoman empire , form the core of pamuk 's writing .
turkey 's best-selling author born on june 7 , 1952 into a wealthy , westernized family , pamuk gave up architecture studies at the age of 23 and devoted himself to writing .
he published his prize-winning first novel , " cevdet bey and his sons , " seven years later . pamuk mostly shuns the public eye , chain-smoking and writing for long hours in an istanbul flat overlooking the bridge over the bosphorus linking europe and asia .
often casually dressed with jacket over t-shirt , his boyish appearance offset by graying hair and thick glasses , pamuk talks a mile a minute , the words spilling out in bursts as he grimaces and gesticulates .

" the 54-year-old writer is turkey 's best-known author at home and abroad , but also a straight-talking rebel whose views on his country 's history have caused a storm both at home and abroad .
recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk writes with a passion about his hometown , istanbul the charges were dropped early in 2006 , but the damage had been done .
death threats followed , and a provincial official even ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books - a move nullified by the government , touchy on rights issues as it strives to make turkey a full member of the european union . torn between his political dissidence and his desire to see turkey in the eu , pamuk said he was irked to see the country 's many opponents in europe using his court case to argue against turkey 's membership . the country 's decades-old attempts to become fully european , accompanied by clashes between islam and secularism and tradition and modernity , and the often painful social and psychological impact of the aggressive westernization that followed the collapse of the ottoman empire , form the core of pamuk 's writing .
turkey 's best-selling author born on june 7 , 1952 into a wealthy , westernized family , pamuk gave up architecture studies at the age of 23 and devoted himself to writing .
he published his prize-winning first novel , " cevdet bey and his sons , " seven years later . pamuk mostly shuns the public eye , chain-smoking and writing for long hours in an istanbul flat overlooking the bridge over the bosphorus linking europe and asia .
often casually dressed with jacket over t-shirt , his boyish appearance offset by graying hair and thick glasses , pamuk talks a mile a minute , the words spilling out in bursts as he grimaces and gesticulates .

" in addition , older persons should be able to work longer , said spidla . according to estimates provided by the commissioner , the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- will shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , even taking into account 1.8 million immigrating into the eu every year . by 2050 , the loss of workers is estimated to come to as many as 48 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment , social affairs and equal opportunities commissioner " if we do nothing , two workers have to pay for every retiree , " he said , referring to the current system in which pension plans are supported by payroll contributions made by workers . economic and currency commissioner joaquin almunia called on governments to develop sustainable social models .
among eu countries , germany has some of the bloc 's highest pension costs . population issue in all decisions authorities in brussels plan , from now on , to take the issue of demographic development into consideration when drafting new policies .
in addition , every two years a demographic forum will compile information on population development from eu member states .
concrete legal regulations regarding the issue , however , are not planned at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors working longer would also please the eu the announcement also spoke of allowing people over the age of 65 to participate longer in economic and social life .
according to spidla , the goal of keeping older workers on the jobs longer does in no way contribute to high youth employment in many eu states . " there is no study that says that young people stand in competition with older ones on the job market , " he said .
" these are two different things . " fewer adoptions in germany while europeans in general are having fewer children , germans are also adopting fewer of them .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden reported on thursday that last year , some 4,800 children were adopted , about half as many as in 1993 . the number of adoptive parents has been decreasing for years .
while at the end of 1993 almost 22,000 couples were on waiting lists for adoptive children , at the end of last year that number was 9,300 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adoption is not as common as it once was johannes vocks , the head of the adoption center in frankfurt , said that one can only speculate about the exact reasons behind the decline . " the birth rate has been sinking for years and the population is growing smaller , " he told ap news agency .
" therefore , the number of people wanting to adopt shrinks along with the number of children up for adoption . " whether the declining interest in adoption is also a consequence of artificial insemination could not be determined by the statistics office due to a lack of data . of those adopted last year , around 40 percent are younger than six years of age ; 30 percent were between six and eleven ; and 30 percent were older than 12 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aging germany seeks to prevent a grayer future germany is getting older , but gray hair and wrinkles are the least of its worries .

german chancellor angela merkel will also bring up the issue when she meets with french president jacques chirac . germany is concerned that the restructuring of the problem-wracked european aircraft maker could result in lay-offs at the country 's airbus production factories . " the government will employ all its powers for the german sites .
we will watch closely that possible burdens are fairly distributed , " said economics minister michael glos ahead of the talks . sources close to the french president jacques chirac said the extent and location of any cutbacks now depended on talks by new management at airbus , a subsidiary of eads , according to news agency afp .

gallois reassures germans louis gallois , co-chief executive of eads and the new head of aircraft maker airbus , was due to visit airbus ' factory in hamburg on thursday .

motassadeq was sentenced to 15 years in jail for the murder of more than 3,000 people in the attacks in new york and washington , making him the first person convicted for his alleged role in the attacks . but the verdict was overturned in march 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow questioning of top al qaeda suspects held in american custody . a retrial found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the attacks , but he was still sentenced to seven years in jail for belonging to a terrorist organization .

" reads the sign next to the entrance of the building where the boy 's body was found on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .
the case has horrified germans and caused political fallout , as the child was supposed to be in state custody when he died . police are investigating how a two-year-old bremen boy 's body ended up stuffed in three trashbags in his father 's fridge .
the case has caused outrage in germany and raised serious questions about the effectiveness of the country 's child welfare system . a family court had recently ordered that the boy - identified only as kevin - be taken away from his 41-year-old father , a heroin addict known for his violent outbursts . but when welfare officials and the police went to fetch kevin on tuesday , it was already too late .
police found the child 's corpse in the refrigerator . " kevin was under the guardianship of the state .

german chancellor angela merkel will also bring up the issue when she meets with french president jacques chirac . germany is concerned that the restructuring of the problem-wracked european aircraft maker could result in lay-offs at the country 's airbus production factories . " the government will employ all its powers for the german sites .
we will watch closely that possible burdens are fairly distributed , " said economics minister michael glos ahead of the talks . sources close to the french president jacques chirac said the extent and location of any cutbacks now depended on talks by new management at airbus , a subsidiary of eads , according to news agency afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg-finkenwerder site is airbus ' biggest in germany the sole objective was to " correct structural faults , " a spokesman for chirac said . ratings agency standard and poor 's meanwhile lowered its corporate credit ratings on eads , saying it was concerned about the european aerospace group 's management and its ability to meet organizational and competitive challenges .
gallois reassures germans louis gallois , co-chief executive of eads and the new head of aircraft maker airbus , was due to visit airbus ' factory in hamburg on thursday .
in an interview , he sought to reassure germany that it would not have to bear the brunt of group restructuring . when it came to the decisions as to where and how costs would be cut , fairness and an equal distribution between the countries where airbus sites were situated would be taken into consideration , gallois told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois has tried to sooth the germans " i do n't believe , for example , that you can ask germans to pay for the french or vice versa , " the chief executive said . eads has said the rescue plan drafted by former ceo christian steiff , who was replaced by gallois on monday , will be implemented , although three months would be needed to work out the details .
the problems would cut its cash flow by 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- over four years , excluding any new problems , the concern said last week . airbus aims to cut administrative costs by 30 percent and boost productivity by 20 percent over the next four years . germany is particularly concerned that the hamburg site might be targeted , since some of the problems in the delays in the group 's a380 superjumbo have been traced to that plant . but gallois was reassuring . " if hamburg has lengthened the take-off and landing runways of its airport " in order to cope with the a380 , " that could not be ignored , gallois said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany likely hit by airbus restructuring steering the troubled aircraft manufacturer airbus back on course will likely require restructuring and job cuts , its new ceo warned .

" in addition , older persons should be able to work longer , said spidla . according to estimates provided by the commissioner , the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- will shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , even taking into account 1.8 million immigrating into the eu every year . by 2050 , the loss of workers is estimated to come to as many as 48 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment , social affairs and equal opportunities commissioner " if we do nothing , two workers have to pay for every retiree , " he said , referring to the current system in which pension plans are supported by payroll contributions made by workers . economic and currency commissioner joaquin almunia called on governments to develop sustainable social models .

" these are two different things . " fewer adoptions in germany while europeans in general are having fewer children , germans are also adopting fewer of them .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden reported on thursday that last year , some 4,800 children were adopted , about half as many as in 1993 . the number of adoptive parents has been decreasing for years .

" therefore , the number of people wanting to adopt shrinks along with the number of children up for adoption .

" in addition , older persons should be able to work longer , said spidla . according to estimates provided by the commissioner , the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- will shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , even taking into account 1.8 million immigrating into the eu every year . by 2050 , the loss of workers is estimated to come to as many as 48 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment , social affairs and equal opportunities commissioner " if we do nothing , two workers have to pay for every retiree , " he said , referring to the current system in which pension plans are supported by payroll contributions made by workers . economic and currency commissioner joaquin almunia called on governments to develop sustainable social models .

dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .
that is because india 's trade is very diverse .
it 's divided almost equally between the usa , europe and asia .
bilateral free trade agreements are therefore not particularly attractive to india . " a popular partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the largest player in the global offshore call center business india is nowadays a much sought after partner .
it is seen not only as an upcoming booming economic power , but also as a country beaming with political self-confidence .
india counts as a reliable partner and , as a regional power , it is a guarantor of stability in southeast asia . during his visit last year to the indian subcontinent in march , us president george w. bush de facto recognized india as a nuclear power .
together with germany , brazil and japan , india has been seeking a permanent seat on the un security council .
and , according to christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs , india 's influence on the world stage has actually increased over the past few years . " india has been increasingly trying for several years to play the role of a major power , " wagner said .
" this type of policy has been recognized by the international community .
the very fact that the eu is conducting these bilateral summits and that it has established a strategic partnership with india highlights india 's increasingly important role as a partner in international relations . " advantages over china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is still struggling with the deficiencies of its infrastructure china - india 's archrival - was for a long time the focus of european attention .
the eu-china summit took place for the ninth time this year .
but the two asian giants are very different from each other . " i think that many companies have discovered that they can do good business in india , " wagner said .
" in addition , india has some advantages over china as far as the legal system and the pervasiveness of the english language are concerned . " on the other hand , there are problems with its infrastructure , " he added .
" i think china is ahead of india there .
another aspect is that the high-level service sector is important in india , whereas processing industries play an important role in china . " within the eu , china has one significant advantage over india because it adopted its liberalization policies before india .
politically , however , india is closer to the eu than china is .
according to wagner , democracy is firmly anchored in india and there are no disagreements on the question of human rights . economic pragmatism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's service sector plays an important role in the country 's economy india 's foreign policy , has nonetheless , caused some irritation in europe .
even though india sided with the us and against its traditional friend iran on the question of nuclear energy , and even though india is playing an important role in the restoration of democracy in nepal , its foreign policy has been occasionally determined by unpredictable economic pragmatism . india , for example , signed energy treaties with the internationally outlawed countries such as sudan and myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- . " india has so far pushed its own national interests - such as the energy issue - to the foreground , disregarding the issues of democratization and human rights , which are important to the europeans , " wagner said .
" india 's foreign policy is still not animated with the thought of democratic changes , which is what europeans would like to see .

dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 12.10.2006 turkish author orhan pamuk wins nobel literature prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk has raised rankles among some turks turkish writer orhan pamuk , the author of " my name is red " and " snow , " won the 2006 nobel literature prize , the swedish academy announced on thursday . the jury said pamuk " in the quest for the melancholic soul of his native city -lrb- istanbul -rrb- has discovered new symbols for the clash and interlacing of cultures . " the 54-year-old writer is turkey 's best-known author at home and abroad , but also a straight-talking rebel whose views on his country 's history have caused a storm both at home and abroad .
recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk writes with a passion about his hometown , istanbul the charges were dropped early in 2006 , but the damage had been done .
death threats followed , and a provincial official even ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books - a move nullified by the government , touchy on rights issues as it strives to make turkey a full member of the european union . torn between his political dissidence and his desire to see turkey in the eu , pamuk said he was irked to see the country 's many opponents in europe using his court case to argue against turkey 's membership . the country 's decades-old attempts to become fully european , accompanied by clashes between islam and secularism and tradition and modernity , and the often painful social and psychological impact of the aggressive westernization that followed the collapse of the ottoman empire , form the core of pamuk 's writing .
turkey 's best-selling author born on june 7 , 1952 into a wealthy , westernized family , pamuk gave up architecture studies at the age of 23 and devoted himself to writing .
he published his prize-winning first novel , " cevdet bey and his sons , " seven years later . pamuk mostly shuns the public eye , chain-smoking and writing for long hours in an istanbul flat overlooking the bridge over the bosphorus linking europe and asia .
often casually dressed with jacket over t-shirt , his boyish appearance offset by graying hair and thick glasses , pamuk talks a mile a minute , the words spilling out in bursts as he grimaces and gesticulates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was awarded the german book trade 's peace prize in 2005 he first drew the ire of the state in the mid-1990s when he denounced the treatment of the kurdish minority as the army waged a heavy-handed campaign to suppress a bloody separatist insurgency in the southeast . the government extended an olive branch in 1998 , offering him the accolade of " artist of the state , " but pamuk rejected the honor .
by then , he had become the country 's best-selling author .
his sixth novel , " my name is red , " brought him international fame and a slew of awards . his books , translated into 32 languages , are : " cevdet bey and his sons " -lrb- 1982 -rrb- , " the silent house " -lrb- 1983 -rrb- , " the white castle " -lrb- 1985 -rrb- , " the black book " -lrb- 1990 -rrb- , " the new life " -lrb- 1994 -rrb- , " my name is red " -lrb- 1998 -rrb- , " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- and " istanbul " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- . pamuk 's name was among the frontrunners rumored to win this year 's prize .
he will take home the prize sum of 10 million kronor -lrb- 1.07 million euros , $ 1.37 million -rrb- . last year , the honor went to british playwright harold pinter . pamuk will receive the nobel prize , which consists of money , a gold medal and a diploma , from sweden 's king carl xvi gustaf at a formal ceremony in stockholm on dec .

" the 54-year-old writer is turkey 's best-known author at home and abroad , but also a straight-talking rebel whose views on his country 's history have caused a storm both at home and abroad .
recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk writes with a passion about his hometown , istanbul the charges were dropped early in 2006 , but the damage had been done .
death threats followed , and a provincial official even ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books - a move nullified by the government , touchy on rights issues as it strives to make turkey a full member of the european union . torn between his political dissidence and his desire to see turkey in the eu , pamuk said he was irked to see the country 's many opponents in europe using his court case to argue against turkey 's membership . the country 's decades-old attempts to become fully european , accompanied by clashes between islam and secularism and tradition and modernity , and the often painful social and psychological impact of the aggressive westernization that followed the collapse of the ottoman empire , form the core of pamuk 's writing .
turkey 's best-selling author born on june 7 , 1952 into a wealthy , westernized family , pamuk gave up architecture studies at the age of 23 and devoted himself to writing .
he published his prize-winning first novel , " cevdet bey and his sons , " seven years later . pamuk mostly shuns the public eye , chain-smoking and writing for long hours in an istanbul flat overlooking the bridge over the bosphorus linking europe and asia .
often casually dressed with jacket over t-shirt , his boyish appearance offset by graying hair and thick glasses , pamuk talks a mile a minute , the words spilling out in bursts as he grimaces and gesticulates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was awarded the german book trade 's peace prize in 2005 he first drew the ire of the state in the mid-1990s when he denounced the treatment of the kurdish minority as the army waged a heavy-handed campaign to suppress a bloody separatist insurgency in the southeast . the government extended an olive branch in 1998 , offering him the accolade of " artist of the state , " but pamuk rejected the honor .
by then , he had become the country 's best-selling author .
his sixth novel , " my name is red , " brought him international fame and a slew of awards . his books , translated into 32 languages , are : " cevdet bey and his sons " -lrb- 1982 -rrb- , " the silent house " -lrb- 1983 -rrb- , " the white castle " -lrb- 1985 -rrb- , " the black book " -lrb- 1990 -rrb- , " the new life " -lrb- 1994 -rrb- , " my name is red " -lrb- 1998 -rrb- , " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- and " istanbul " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- . pamuk 's name was among the frontrunners rumored to win this year 's prize .

" the 54-year-old writer is turkey 's best-known author at home and abroad , but also a straight-talking rebel whose views on his country 's history have caused a storm both at home and abroad .
recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk writes with a passion about his hometown , istanbul the charges were dropped early in 2006 , but the damage had been done .
death threats followed , and a provincial official even ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books - a move nullified by the government , touchy on rights issues as it strives to make turkey a full member of the european union . torn between his political dissidence and his desire to see turkey in the eu , pamuk said he was irked to see the country 's many opponents in europe using his court case to argue against turkey 's membership . the country 's decades-old attempts to become fully european , accompanied by clashes between islam and secularism and tradition and modernity , and the often painful social and psychological impact of the aggressive westernization that followed the collapse of the ottoman empire , form the core of pamuk 's writing .
turkey 's best-selling author born on june 7 , 1952 into a wealthy , westernized family , pamuk gave up architecture studies at the age of 23 and devoted himself to writing .
he published his prize-winning first novel , " cevdet bey and his sons , " seven years later . pamuk mostly shuns the public eye , chain-smoking and writing for long hours in an istanbul flat overlooking the bridge over the bosphorus linking europe and asia .
often casually dressed with jacket over t-shirt , his boyish appearance offset by graying hair and thick glasses , pamuk talks a mile a minute , the words spilling out in bursts as he grimaces and gesticulates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was awarded the german book trade 's peace prize in 2005 he first drew the ire of the state in the mid-1990s when he denounced the treatment of the kurdish minority as the army waged a heavy-handed campaign to suppress a bloody separatist insurgency in the southeast . the government extended an olive branch in 1998 , offering him the accolade of " artist of the state , " but pamuk rejected the honor .
by then , he had become the country 's best-selling author .
his sixth novel , " my name is red , " brought him international fame and a slew of awards . his books , translated into 32 languages , are : " cevdet bey and his sons " -lrb- 1982 -rrb- , " the silent house " -lrb- 1983 -rrb- , " the white castle " -lrb- 1985 -rrb- , " the black book " -lrb- 1990 -rrb- , " the new life " -lrb- 1994 -rrb- , " my name is red " -lrb- 1998 -rrb- , " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- and " istanbul " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- . pamuk 's name was among the frontrunners rumored to win this year 's prize .
he will take home the prize sum of 10 million kronor -lrb- 1.07 million euros , $ 1.37 million -rrb- . last year , the honor went to british playwright harold pinter . pamuk will receive the nobel prize , which consists of money , a gold medal and a diploma , from sweden 's king carl xvi gustaf at a formal ceremony in stockholm on dec .

above that , the eu slaps an import duty of 9.6 percent on shipments .
that does n't sit well with some producers , who 'd rather not pay , so they have come up with a way to evade the charge . countries who have preferential trade deals with the eu , there are no restrictions on trade volume and duties do n't have to be paid , given that the fresh garlic originates in a country with such a deal .

eu officials do have to worry about human trafficking , drug smuggling and the like , but what they 're really miffed about these days is garlic .
imports are coming in from china evading import duties .
it must be stopped . the little white bulbs have become such a problem in the eu that a special seminar was held in the austrian town of pörtschach , where officials laid out the many devious ways in which unscrupulous traffickers of garlic from china got their wares into the eu illegally . for fresh garlic from china , the world 's largest garlic producer , the eu has an annual quota of 13,000 tons .
above that , the eu slaps an import duty of 9.6 percent on shipments .
that does n't sit well with some producers , who 'd rather not pay , so they have come up with a way to evade the charge . countries who have preferential trade deals with the eu , there are no restrictions on trade volume and duties do n't have to be paid , given that the fresh garlic originates in a country with such a deal .
so smugglers simply ship the garlic into a country such as myanmar , serbia or bulgaria , disguise the product 's origin , and get out of paying the import duties . the eu did n't say how widespread the problem is , but said one container with 20 tons of fresh garlic smuggled successfully into the eu could provide a profit of 24,000 euros -lrb- $ 30,170 -rrb- by evading the import duties . another tactic : fresh garlic is sometimes misdeclared as elephant garlic , which just has one clove , and is therefore exempt from import restrictions . it seems the smugglers ' audacity knows no bounds . but olaf , the eu 's anti-fraud unit , is on the case .
besides conducting the garlic seminar , staff members have extensively analyzed all world trade flows of chinese garlic and developed new intelligence tools for a more efficient fight against this growing scourge . " the fight goes on , " said olaf in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de botching the booty in bergen consulting a map sometimes comes in quite handy , especially when trying to smuggle large quantities of illegal substances across europe , as one woman recently found out on germany 's largest island .

11 hijackers . germany 's highest court begins hearing the appeal of mounir el motassadeq thursday .
the court will determine whether the 32-year-old moroccan knew enough about the plans of the sept .
11 hijackers to be considered the member of a terrorist group . motassadeq lives in hamburg and was part of a circle that included mohamed atta and two of the other hijackers that carried out the suicide attacks in the us .
motassadeq 's lawyers argue he was a low-tier member of a group of radical arab students and did not know the hijackers ' plans . long court process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did motassadeq know about the sept .
11 attacks ?
in 2003 , a court in the northern city of hamburg determined that motassadeq had plotted holy war with fellow muslim extremists .
motassadeq was sentenced to 15 years in jail for the murder of more than 3,000 people in the attacks in new york and washington , making him the first person convicted for his alleged role in the attacks . but the verdict was overturned in march 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow questioning of top al qaeda suspects held in american custody . a retrial found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the attacks , but he was still sentenced to seven years in jail for belonging to a terrorist organization .
in a surprise move , germany 's constitutional court released motassadeq from prison in february pending his appeal . a friend of terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several courts have heard the case against motassadeq motassadeq 's defense team believes they can prove that while motassadeq was a friend of the terrorists , he himself was not a member of a terrorist organization . " we believe we can convince the court that the decision was unjust and should be overturned , " said motassadeq 's lawyer ladislav anisic . a decision by germany 's highest court of appeals is likely to take several weeks and will focus on complicated legal questions .

german chancellor angela merkel will also bring up the issue when she meets with french president jacques chirac . germany is concerned that the restructuring of the problem-wracked european aircraft maker could result in lay-offs at the country 's airbus production factories . " the government will employ all its powers for the german sites .
we will watch closely that possible burdens are fairly distributed , " said economics minister michael glos ahead of the talks . sources close to the french president jacques chirac said the extent and location of any cutbacks now depended on talks by new management at airbus , a subsidiary of eads , according to news agency afp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg-finkenwerder site is airbus ' biggest in germany the sole objective was to " correct structural faults , " a spokesman for chirac said . ratings agency standard and poor 's meanwhile lowered its corporate credit ratings on eads , saying it was concerned about the european aerospace group 's management and its ability to meet organizational and competitive challenges .
gallois reassures germans louis gallois , co-chief executive of eads and the new head of aircraft maker airbus , was due to visit airbus ' factory in hamburg on thursday .
in an interview , he sought to reassure germany that it would not have to bear the brunt of group restructuring . when it came to the decisions as to where and how costs would be cut , fairness and an equal distribution between the countries where airbus sites were situated would be taken into consideration , gallois told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallois has tried to sooth the germans " i do n't believe , for example , that you can ask germans to pay for the french or vice versa , " the chief executive said . eads has said the rescue plan drafted by former ceo christian steiff , who was replaced by gallois on monday , will be implemented , although three months would be needed to work out the details .
the problems would cut its cash flow by 6.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- over four years , excluding any new problems , the concern said last week . airbus aims to cut administrative costs by 30 percent and boost productivity by 20 percent over the next four years . germany is particularly concerned that the hamburg site might be targeted , since some of the problems in the delays in the group 's a380 superjumbo have been traced to that plant . but gallois was reassuring . " if hamburg has lengthened the take-off and landing runways of its airport " in order to cope with the a380 , " that could not be ignored , gallois said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany likely hit by airbus restructuring steering the troubled aircraft manufacturer airbus back on course will likely require restructuring and job cuts , its new ceo warned .

" in addition , older persons should be able to work longer , said spidla . according to estimates provided by the commissioner , the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- will shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , even taking into account 1.8 million immigrating into the eu every year . by 2050 , the loss of workers is estimated to come to as many as 48 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment , social affairs and equal opportunities commissioner " if we do nothing , two workers have to pay for every retiree , " he said , referring to the current system in which pension plans are supported by payroll contributions made by workers . economic and currency commissioner joaquin almunia called on governments to develop sustainable social models .

" these are two different things . " fewer adoptions in germany while europeans in general are having fewer children , germans are also adopting fewer of them .

" therefore , the number of people wanting to adopt shrinks along with the number of children up for adoption .

" in addition , older persons should be able to work longer , said spidla . according to estimates provided by the commissioner , the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- will shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , even taking into account 1.8 million immigrating into the eu every year . by 2050 , the loss of workers is estimated to come to as many as 48 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment , social affairs and equal opportunities commissioner " if we do nothing , two workers have to pay for every retiree , " he said , referring to the current system in which pension plans are supported by payroll contributions made by workers . economic and currency commissioner joaquin almunia called on governments to develop sustainable social models .
among eu countries , germany has some of the bloc 's highest pension costs . population issue in all decisions authorities in brussels plan , from now on , to take the issue of demographic development into consideration when drafting new policies .
in addition , every two years a demographic forum will compile information on population development from eu member states .
concrete legal regulations regarding the issue , however , are not planned at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors working longer would also please the eu the announcement also spoke of allowing people over the age of 65 to participate longer in economic and social life .
according to spidla , the goal of keeping older workers on the jobs longer does in no way contribute to high youth employment in many eu states . " there is no study that says that young people stand in competition with older ones on the job market , " he said .
" these are two different things . " fewer adoptions in germany while europeans in general are having fewer children , germans are also adopting fewer of them .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden reported on thursday that last year , some 4,800 children were adopted , about half as many as in 1993 . the number of adoptive parents has been decreasing for years .
while at the end of 1993 almost 22,000 couples were on waiting lists for adoptive children , at the end of last year that number was 9,300 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adoption is not as common as it once was johannes vocks , the head of the adoption center in frankfurt , said that one can only speculate about the exact reasons behind the decline . " the birth rate has been sinking for years and the population is growing smaller , " he told ap news agency .
" therefore , the number of people wanting to adopt shrinks along with the number of children up for adoption . " whether the declining interest in adoption is also a consequence of artificial insemination could not be determined by the statistics office due to a lack of data . of those adopted last year , around 40 percent are younger than six years of age ; 30 percent were between six and eleven ; and 30 percent were older than 12 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aging germany seeks to prevent a grayer future germany is getting older , but gray hair and wrinkles are the least of its worries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 12.10.2006 eu-india summit to foster economic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu recognizes india 's increasing influence on the world stage the seventh eu-india economic summit will open on friday in finnish capital helsinki .
dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .
that is because india 's trade is very diverse .
it 's divided almost equally between the usa , europe and asia .
bilateral free trade agreements are therefore not particularly attractive to india . " a popular partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the largest player in the global offshore call center business india is nowadays a much sought after partner .
it is seen not only as an upcoming booming economic power , but also as a country beaming with political self-confidence .
india counts as a reliable partner and , as a regional power , it is a guarantor of stability in southeast asia . during his visit last year to the indian subcontinent in march , us president george w. bush de facto recognized india as a nuclear power .
together with germany , brazil and japan , india has been seeking a permanent seat on the un security council .
and , according to christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs , india 's influence on the world stage has actually increased over the past few years . " india has been increasingly trying for several years to play the role of a major power , " wagner said .
" this type of policy has been recognized by the international community .
the very fact that the eu is conducting these bilateral summits and that it has established a strategic partnership with india highlights india 's increasingly important role as a partner in international relations . " advantages over china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is still struggling with the deficiencies of its infrastructure china - india 's archrival - was for a long time the focus of european attention .
the eu-china summit took place for the ninth time this year .
but the two asian giants are very different from each other . " i think that many companies have discovered that they can do good business in india , " wagner said .
" in addition , india has some advantages over china as far as the legal system and the pervasiveness of the english language are concerned . " on the other hand , there are problems with its infrastructure , " he added .
" i think china is ahead of india there .
another aspect is that the high-level service sector is important in india , whereas processing industries play an important role in china . " within the eu , china has one significant advantage over india because it adopted its liberalization policies before india .
politically , however , india is closer to the eu than china is .
according to wagner , democracy is firmly anchored in india and there are no disagreements on the question of human rights . economic pragmatism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's service sector plays an important role in the country 's economy india 's foreign policy , has nonetheless , caused some irritation in europe .
even though india sided with the us and against its traditional friend iran on the question of nuclear energy , and even though india is playing an important role in the restoration of democracy in nepal , its foreign policy has been occasionally determined by unpredictable economic pragmatism . india , for example , signed energy treaties with the internationally outlawed countries such as sudan and myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- . " india has so far pushed its own national interests - such as the energy issue - to the foreground , disregarding the issues of democratization and human rights , which are important to the europeans , " wagner said .
" india 's foreign policy is still not animated with the thought of democratic changes , which is what europeans would like to see .
in this respect , india - like china - is pursuing a classical great-power policy .

" the 54-year-old writer is turkey 's best-known author at home and abroad , but also a straight-talking rebel whose views on his country 's history have caused a storm both at home and abroad .
recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk writes with a passion about his hometown , istanbul the charges were dropped early in 2006 , but the damage had been done .
death threats followed , and a provincial official even ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books - a move nullified by the government , touchy on rights issues as it strives to make turkey a full member of the european union . torn between his political dissidence and his desire to see turkey in the eu , pamuk said he was irked to see the country 's many opponents in europe using his court case to argue against turkey 's membership . the country 's decades-old attempts to become fully european , accompanied by clashes between islam and secularism and tradition and modernity , and the often painful social and psychological impact of the aggressive westernization that followed the collapse of the ottoman empire , form the core of pamuk 's writing .
turkey 's best-selling author born on june 7 , 1952 into a wealthy , westernized family , pamuk gave up architecture studies at the age of 23 and devoted himself to writing .
he published his prize-winning first novel , " cevdet bey and his sons , " seven years later . pamuk mostly shuns the public eye , chain-smoking and writing for long hours in an istanbul flat overlooking the bridge over the bosphorus linking europe and asia .

by then , he had become the country 's best-selling author .
his sixth novel , " my name is red , " brought him international fame and a slew of awards . his books , translated into 32 languages , are : " cevdet bey and his sons " -lrb- 1982 -rrb- , " the silent house " -lrb- 1983 -rrb- , " the white castle " -lrb- 1985 -rrb- , " the black book " -lrb- 1990 -rrb- , " the new life " -lrb- 1994 -rrb- , " my name is red " -lrb- 1998 -rrb- , " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- and " istanbul " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- . pamuk 's name was among the frontrunners rumored to win this year 's prize .

" the 54-year-old writer is turkey 's best-known author at home and abroad , but also a straight-talking rebel whose views on his country 's history have caused a storm both at home and abroad .
recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk writes with a passion about his hometown , istanbul the charges were dropped early in 2006 , but the damage had been done .
death threats followed , and a provincial official even ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books - a move nullified by the government , touchy on rights issues as it strives to make turkey a full member of the european union . torn between his political dissidence and his desire to see turkey in the eu , pamuk said he was irked to see the country 's many opponents in europe using his court case to argue against turkey 's membership . the country 's decades-old attempts to become fully european , accompanied by clashes between islam and secularism and tradition and modernity , and the often painful social and psychological impact of the aggressive westernization that followed the collapse of the ottoman empire , form the core of pamuk 's writing .
turkey 's best-selling author born on june 7 , 1952 into a wealthy , westernized family , pamuk gave up architecture studies at the age of 23 and devoted himself to writing .
he published his prize-winning first novel , " cevdet bey and his sons , " seven years later . pamuk mostly shuns the public eye , chain-smoking and writing for long hours in an istanbul flat overlooking the bridge over the bosphorus linking europe and asia .
often casually dressed with jacket over t-shirt , his boyish appearance offset by graying hair and thick glasses , pamuk talks a mile a minute , the words spilling out in bursts as he grimaces and gesticulates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was awarded the german book trade 's peace prize in 2005 he first drew the ire of the state in the mid-1990s when he denounced the treatment of the kurdish minority as the army waged a heavy-handed campaign to suppress a bloody separatist insurgency in the southeast . the government extended an olive branch in 1998 , offering him the accolade of " artist of the state , " but pamuk rejected the honor .
by then , he had become the country 's best-selling author .

dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .
that is because india 's trade is very diverse .
it 's divided almost equally between the usa , europe and asia .
bilateral free trade agreements are therefore not particularly attractive to india . " a popular partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the largest player in the global offshore call center business india is nowadays a much sought after partner .
it is seen not only as an upcoming booming economic power , but also as a country beaming with political self-confidence .
india counts as a reliable partner and , as a regional power , it is a guarantor of stability in southeast asia . during his visit last year to the indian subcontinent in march , us president george w. bush de facto recognized india as a nuclear power .
together with germany , brazil and japan , india has been seeking a permanent seat on the un security council .
and , according to christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs , india 's influence on the world stage has actually increased over the past few years . " india has been increasingly trying for several years to play the role of a major power , " wagner said .
" this type of policy has been recognized by the international community .
the very fact that the eu is conducting these bilateral summits and that it has established a strategic partnership with india highlights india 's increasingly important role as a partner in international relations . " advantages over china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is still struggling with the deficiencies of its infrastructure china - india 's archrival - was for a long time the focus of european attention .
the eu-china summit took place for the ninth time this year .
but the two asian giants are very different from each other . " i think that many companies have discovered that they can do good business in india , " wagner said .
" in addition , india has some advantages over china as far as the legal system and the pervasiveness of the english language are concerned . " on the other hand , there are problems with its infrastructure , " he added .
" i think china is ahead of india there .
another aspect is that the high-level service sector is important in india , whereas processing industries play an important role in china . " within the eu , china has one significant advantage over india because it adopted its liberalization policies before india .
politically , however , india is closer to the eu than china is .
according to wagner , democracy is firmly anchored in india and there are no disagreements on the question of human rights . economic pragmatism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's service sector plays an important role in the country 's economy india 's foreign policy , has nonetheless , caused some irritation in europe .
even though india sided with the us and against its traditional friend iran on the question of nuclear energy , and even though india is playing an important role in the restoration of democracy in nepal , its foreign policy has been occasionally determined by unpredictable economic pragmatism . india , for example , signed energy treaties with the internationally outlawed countries such as sudan and myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- . " india has so far pushed its own national interests - such as the energy issue - to the foreground , disregarding the issues of democratization and human rights , which are important to the europeans , " wagner said .
" india 's foreign policy is still not animated with the thought of democratic changes , which is what europeans would like to see .
in this respect , india - like china - is pursuing a classical great-power policy .

i feel for germany .
with france and russia as best friends , one does n't need any enemies . - wiley horne , usa it is sad to see an aviation project like the a380 suffer , but it suffers due to a misled strategy based on bringing france -lrb- germany , and the eu as a whole -rrb- the glory of producing the " world 's largest passenger plane . "
surpassing the b747 in size , endurance , comfort , economy plus large hub-to-hub transport may have been justifications to the market , but the underlying motivations may just have been the challenge to feel the glory .
we all remember the other major project , concorde .
it was built and flown not for profit , but for glory .
will the a380 be the eu 's second concorde ?
as it is already in flight test , it would be impossibly embarrassing to discontinue the a380 and focus long term on non-glorifying mid-sized -lrb- a350 -rrb- and smaller jets -lrb- a32x -rrb- .
if governments were not stockholders in eads it just might be possible to " bite the bullet " and cancel the a380 , forget the glory and get to the business of making a profit . - rodney lee , usa of course , the german government should get involved .
these things are much too big to rely on the market and its sometimes quirky outcomes . - ed mueller now we see the difference between a company like boeing , which has to actually make a profit in the private sector to survive , and airbus , which until recently could just build and sell its planes regardless of loss because sponsoring governments would simply make up the difference .
welcome to the market , airbus . - jl ronish the multinational airbus company is a bureaucrat 's heaven !
a purge on wasted effort is long overdue . - ted , uk i am surprised about the statement that the two year delay of the a380 is due to wiring problems and to the software learning process of said wiring task .
the real problem lays , as it is even partially visible from your own articles , in other far more serious issues , such as extreme design mistakes due to a lack of organization " 10 years or more " behind boeing , lack of experience in very large aircrafts , a feuding multinational management and , last but not least , the political pressure of mainly the french government , blinded by its inferiority complex versus the usa .
and if this possibly fatal mistake is compounded by abandoning the much larger middle-size market , already hurt by the ongoing a350 mismanagement , all the billions spent by the european governments in legal , but often illegal , subsidies to support sale prices below cost will be lost , and airbus -lrb- will -rrb- enter history as one of the biggest flops recorded . - otto tisch , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany likely hit by airbus restructuring steering the troubled aircraft manufacturer airbus back on course will likely require restructuring and job cuts , its new ceo warned .

they are second behind the czech republic who were held to a 1-1 draw in dublin by ireland .
slovakia are third with six points from four matches . a small number of german fans was involved in clashes with police during the game and ballack said that it was difficult to say something about such incidents . " one can only say that the team totally distances itself from those people .

dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .
that is because india 's trade is very diverse .
it 's divided almost equally between the usa , europe and asia .
bilateral free trade agreements are therefore not particularly attractive to india . " a popular partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the largest player in the global offshore call center business india is nowadays a much sought after partner .
it is seen not only as an upcoming booming economic power , but also as a country beaming with political self-confidence .
india counts as a reliable partner and , as a regional power , it is a guarantor of stability in southeast asia . during his visit last year to the indian subcontinent in march , us president george w. bush de facto recognized india as a nuclear power .
together with germany , brazil and japan , india has been seeking a permanent seat on the un security council .
and , according to christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs , india 's influence on the world stage has actually increased over the past few years . " india has been increasingly trying for several years to play the role of a major power , " wagner said .
" this type of policy has been recognized by the international community .
the very fact that the eu is conducting these bilateral summits and that it has established a strategic partnership with india highlights india 's increasingly important role as a partner in international relations .

the eu-china summit took place for the ninth time this year .
but the two asian giants are very different from each other . " i think that many companies have discovered that they can do good business in india , " wagner said .
" in addition , india has some advantages over china as far as the legal system and the pervasiveness of the english language are concerned . " on the other hand , there are problems with its infrastructure , " he added .
" i think china is ahead of india there .
another aspect is that the high-level service sector is important in india , whereas processing industries play an important role in china . " within the eu , china has one significant advantage over india because it adopted its liberalization policies before india .
politically , however , india is closer to the eu than china is .
according to wagner , democracy is firmly anchored in india and there are no disagreements on the question of human rights . economic pragmatism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's service sector plays an important role in the country 's economy india 's foreign policy , has nonetheless , caused some irritation in europe .
even though india sided with the us and against its traditional friend iran on the question of nuclear energy , and even though india is playing an important role in the restoration of democracy in nepal , its foreign policy has been occasionally determined by unpredictable economic pragmatism . india , for example , signed energy treaties with the internationally outlawed countries such as sudan and myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- . " india has so far pushed its own national interests - such as the energy issue - to the foreground , disregarding the issues of democratization and human rights , which are important to the europeans , " wagner said .

the crushing victory was marred by crowd trouble as german fans fought with police . five days after stunning wales 5-1 in cardiff , the slovaks could do nothing against a german onslaught in the opening minutes that saw the visitors race into a two-goal lead after just 25 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw again had reason to celebrate coach joachim löw said that it helped the side settle down by scoring early goals .

captain michael ballack added a second in the 25th minute with a diving header from a cross from philipp lahm . the match was over as a contest in the 36th minute when bastian schweinsteiger made it three after goalkeeper kamil contofalsky failed to hold onto a ballack shot and the bayern midfielder slammed the ball into the back of the net . germany began the second half somewhat slower and allowed defender stanislav varga pull one back with a header in the 58th minute after goalkeeper jens lehmann failed to come out strongly to claim the ball floated in from a free-kick . germany step off the gas to coast to victory bildunterschrift : germany striker miroslav klose found himself having to defend in the second-half löw said that he had understanding for his players that they did not begin the second half as energetic as they had the first .
" after leading by three goals it is not easy to just continue pushing forward .
but i was very happy to see that when slovakia pulled one back the team upped the pace again . " podolski scored his second in the 72nd minute after being set up by striker miroslav klose . the result sees germany move to nine points from three matches .
they are second behind the czech republic who were held to a 1-1 draw in dublin by ireland .
slovakia are third with six points from four matches . a small number of german fans was involved in clashes with police during the game and ballack said that it was difficult to say something about such incidents . " one can only say that the team totally distances itself from those people .
when we are on the field we just want to play well , we do not really take too much notice of things that happen on the stands , " he said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uncapped germans receive chance in georgia friendly germany coach joachim löw aims to test a number of uncapped players in saturday 's friendly international against georgia , with his mind focused on a euro 2008 qualifier in slovakia on wednesday .

dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .
that is because india 's trade is very diverse .
it 's divided almost equally between the usa , europe and asia .
bilateral free trade agreements are therefore not particularly attractive to india . " a popular partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the largest player in the global offshore call center business india is nowadays a much sought after partner .
it is seen not only as an upcoming booming economic power , but also as a country beaming with political self-confidence .
india counts as a reliable partner and , as a regional power , it is a guarantor of stability in southeast asia . during his visit last year to the indian subcontinent in march , us president george w. bush de facto recognized india as a nuclear power .
together with germany , brazil and japan , india has been seeking a permanent seat on the un security council .
and , according to christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs , india 's influence on the world stage has actually increased over the past few years . " india has been increasingly trying for several years to play the role of a major power , " wagner said .
" this type of policy has been recognized by the international community .
the very fact that the eu is conducting these bilateral summits and that it has established a strategic partnership with india highlights india 's increasingly important role as a partner in international relations . " advantages over china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is still struggling with the deficiencies of its infrastructure china - india 's archrival - was for a long time the focus of european attention .
the eu-china summit took place for the ninth time this year .
but the two asian giants are very different from each other . " i think that many companies have discovered that they can do good business in india , " wagner said .
" in addition , india has some advantages over china as far as the legal system and the pervasiveness of the english language are concerned . " on the other hand , there are problems with its infrastructure , " he added .
" i think china is ahead of india there .
another aspect is that the high-level service sector is important in india , whereas processing industries play an important role in china . " within the eu , china has one significant advantage over india because it adopted its liberalization policies before india .
politically , however , india is closer to the eu than china is .
according to wagner , democracy is firmly anchored in india and there are no disagreements on the question of human rights . economic pragmatism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's service sector plays an important role in the country 's economy india 's foreign policy , has nonetheless , caused some irritation in europe .
even though india sided with the us and against its traditional friend iran on the question of nuclear energy , and even though india is playing an important role in the restoration of democracy in nepal , its foreign policy has been occasionally determined by unpredictable economic pragmatism . india , for example , signed energy treaties with the internationally outlawed countries such as sudan and myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- . " india has so far pushed its own national interests - such as the energy issue - to the foreground , disregarding the issues of democratization and human rights , which are important to the europeans , " wagner said .
" india 's foreign policy is still not animated with the thought of democratic changes , which is what europeans would like to see .
in this respect , india - like china - is pursuing a classical great-power policy .

i feel for germany .
with france and russia as best friends , one does n't need any enemies . - wiley horne , usa it is sad to see an aviation project like the a380 suffer , but it suffers due to a misled strategy based on bringing france -lrb- germany , and the eu as a whole -rrb- the glory of producing the " world 's largest passenger plane . "
surpassing the b747 in size , endurance , comfort , economy plus large hub-to-hub transport may have been justifications to the market , but the underlying motivations may just have been the challenge to feel the glory .
we all remember the other major project , concorde .
it was built and flown not for profit , but for glory .
will the a380 be the eu 's second concorde ?
as it is already in flight test , it would be impossibly embarrassing to discontinue the a380 and focus long term on non-glorifying mid-sized -lrb- a350 -rrb- and smaller jets -lrb- a32x -rrb- .
if governments were not stockholders in eads it just might be possible to " bite the bullet " and cancel the a380 , forget the glory and get to the business of making a profit . - rodney lee , usa of course , the german government should get involved .
these things are much too big to rely on the market and its sometimes quirky outcomes . - ed mueller now we see the difference between a company like boeing , which has to actually make a profit in the private sector to survive , and airbus , which until recently could just build and sell its planes regardless of loss because sponsoring governments would simply make up the difference .
welcome to the market , airbus . - jl ronish the multinational airbus company is a bureaucrat 's heaven !
a purge on wasted effort is long overdue . - ted , uk i am surprised about the statement that the two year delay of the a380 is due to wiring problems and to the software learning process of said wiring task .
the real problem lays , as it is even partially visible from your own articles , in other far more serious issues , such as extreme design mistakes due to a lack of organization " 10 years or more " behind boeing , lack of experience in very large aircrafts , a feuding multinational management and , last but not least , the political pressure of mainly the french government , blinded by its inferiority complex versus the usa .
and if this possibly fatal mistake is compounded by abandoning the much larger middle-size market , already hurt by the ongoing a350 mismanagement , all the billions spent by the european governments in legal , but often illegal , subsidies to support sale prices below cost will be lost , and airbus -lrb- will -rrb- enter history as one of the biggest flops recorded . - otto tisch , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany likely hit by airbus restructuring steering the troubled aircraft manufacturer airbus back on course will likely require restructuring and job cuts , its new ceo warned .
germany could bear the brunt of any factory organization .
-lrb- 10.10.2006 -rrb- bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm .

" in addition , older persons should be able to work longer , said spidla . according to estimates provided by the commissioner , the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- will shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , even taking into account 1.8 million immigrating into the eu every year . by 2050 , the loss of workers is estimated to come to as many as 48 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment , social affairs and equal opportunities commissioner " if we do nothing , two workers have to pay for every retiree , " he said , referring to the current system in which pension plans are supported by payroll contributions made by workers . economic and currency commissioner joaquin almunia called on governments to develop sustainable social models .
among eu countries , germany has some of the bloc 's highest pension costs . population issue in all decisions authorities in brussels plan , from now on , to take the issue of demographic development into consideration when drafting new policies .
in addition , every two years a demographic forum will compile information on population development from eu member states .
concrete legal regulations regarding the issue , however , are not planned at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors working longer would also please the eu the announcement also spoke of allowing people over the age of 65 to participate longer in economic and social life .
according to spidla , the goal of keeping older workers on the jobs longer does in no way contribute to high youth employment in many eu states . " there is no study that says that young people stand in competition with older ones on the job market , " he said .
" these are two different things . " fewer adoptions in germany while europeans in general are having fewer children , germans are also adopting fewer of them .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden reported on thursday that last year , some 4,800 children were adopted , about half as many as in 1993 . the number of adoptive parents has been decreasing for years .
while at the end of 1993 almost 22,000 couples were on waiting lists for adoptive children , at the end of last year that number was 9,300 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adoption is not as common as it once was johannes vocks , the head of the adoption center in frankfurt , said that one can only speculate about the exact reasons behind the decline . " the birth rate has been sinking for years and the population is growing smaller , " he told ap news agency .
" therefore , the number of people wanting to adopt shrinks along with the number of children up for adoption . " whether the declining interest in adoption is also a consequence of artificial insemination could not be determined by the statistics office due to a lack of data . of those adopted last year , around 40 percent are younger than six years of age ; 30 percent were between six and eleven ; and 30 percent were older than 12 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aging germany seeks to prevent a grayer future germany is getting older , but gray hair and wrinkles are the least of its worries .

these things are much too big to rely on the market and its sometimes quirky outcomes . - ed mueller now we see the difference between a company like boeing , which has to actually make a profit in the private sector to survive , and airbus , which until recently could just build and sell its planes regardless of loss because sponsoring governments would simply make up the difference .
welcome to the market , airbus . - jl ronish the multinational airbus company is a bureaucrat 's heaven !
a purge on wasted effort is long overdue . - ted , uk i am surprised about the statement that the two year delay of the a380 is due to wiring problems and to the software learning process of said wiring task .
the real problem lays , as it is even partially visible from your own articles , in other far more serious issues , such as extreme design mistakes due to a lack of organization " 10 years or more " behind boeing , lack of experience in very large aircrafts , a feuding multinational management and , last but not least , the political pressure of mainly the french government , blinded by its inferiority complex versus the usa .
and if this possibly fatal mistake is compounded by abandoning the much larger middle-size market , already hurt by the ongoing a350 mismanagement , all the billions spent by the european governments in legal , but often illegal , subsidies to support sale prices below cost will be lost , and airbus -lrb- will -rrb- enter history as one of the biggest flops recorded . - otto tisch , usa compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany likely hit by airbus restructuring steering the troubled aircraft manufacturer airbus back on course will likely require restructuring and job cuts , its new ceo warned .
germany could bear the brunt of any factory organization .
-lrb- 10.10.2006 -rrb- bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm .

" the 54-year-old writer is turkey 's best-known author at home and abroad , but also a straight-talking rebel whose views on his country 's history have caused a storm both at home and abroad .
recent statements on both the situation of turkey 's kurds and the killings of armenians in the early years of the 20th century turned pamuk into a controversial figure . " one million armenians and 30,000 kurds were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares talk about it , " pamuk , 54 , told a swiss magazine in february 2005 . death threats the remarks , which sparked outrage in turkey , prompted a public prosecutor to file charges against pamuk for denigrating the country 's national identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk writes with a passion about his hometown , istanbul the charges were dropped early in 2006 , but the damage had been done .
death threats followed , and a provincial official even ordered the destruction of pamuk 's books - a move nullified by the government , touchy on rights issues as it strives to make turkey a full member of the european union . torn between his political dissidence and his desire to see turkey in the eu , pamuk said he was irked to see the country 's many opponents in europe using his court case to argue against turkey 's membership . the country 's decades-old attempts to become fully european , accompanied by clashes between islam and secularism and tradition and modernity , and the often painful social and psychological impact of the aggressive westernization that followed the collapse of the ottoman empire , form the core of pamuk 's writing .
turkey 's best-selling author born on june 7 , 1952 into a wealthy , westernized family , pamuk gave up architecture studies at the age of 23 and devoted himself to writing .
he published his prize-winning first novel , " cevdet bey and his sons , " seven years later . pamuk mostly shuns the public eye , chain-smoking and writing for long hours in an istanbul flat overlooking the bridge over the bosphorus linking europe and asia .
often casually dressed with jacket over t-shirt , his boyish appearance offset by graying hair and thick glasses , pamuk talks a mile a minute , the words spilling out in bursts as he grimaces and gesticulates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was awarded the german book trade 's peace prize in 2005 he first drew the ire of the state in the mid-1990s when he denounced the treatment of the kurdish minority as the army waged a heavy-handed campaign to suppress a bloody separatist insurgency in the southeast . the government extended an olive branch in 1998 , offering him the accolade of " artist of the state , " but pamuk rejected the honor .
by then , he had become the country 's best-selling author .
his sixth novel , " my name is red , " brought him international fame and a slew of awards . his books , translated into 32 languages , are : " cevdet bey and his sons " -lrb- 1982 -rrb- , " the silent house " -lrb- 1983 -rrb- , " the white castle " -lrb- 1985 -rrb- , " the black book " -lrb- 1990 -rrb- , " the new life " -lrb- 1994 -rrb- , " my name is red " -lrb- 1998 -rrb- , " snow " -lrb- 2002 -rrb- and " istanbul " -lrb- 2003 -rrb- . pamuk 's name was among the frontrunners rumored to win this year 's prize .
he will take home the prize sum of 10 million kronor -lrb- 1.07 million euros , $ 1.37 million -rrb- . last year , the honor went to british playwright harold pinter . pamuk will receive the nobel prize , which consists of money , a gold medal and a diploma , from sweden 's king carl xvi gustaf at a formal ceremony in stockholm on dec .

the court will determine whether the 32-year-old moroccan knew enough about the plans of the sept .
11 hijackers to be considered the member of a terrorist group . motassadeq lives in hamburg and was part of a circle that included mohamed atta and two of the other hijackers that carried out the suicide attacks in the us .

in 2003 , a court in the northern city of hamburg determined that motassadeq had plotted holy war with fellow muslim extremists .
motassadeq was sentenced to 15 years in jail for the murder of more than 3,000 people in the attacks in new york and washington , making him the first person convicted for his alleged role in the attacks . but the verdict was overturned in march 2004 because us authorities had refused to allow questioning of top al qaeda suspects held in american custody . a retrial found no evidence that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the attacks , but he was still sentenced to seven years in jail for belonging to a terrorist organization .
in a surprise move , germany 's constitutional court released motassadeq from prison in february pending his appeal . a friend of terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several courts have heard the case against motassadeq motassadeq 's defense team believes they can prove that while motassadeq was a friend of the terrorists , he himself was not a member of a terrorist organization . " we believe we can convince the court that the decision was unjust and should be overturned , " said motassadeq 's lawyer ladislav anisic . a decision by germany 's highest court of appeals is likely to take several weeks and will focus on complicated legal questions .

dw-world.de takes a look at the current state of eu-indian relations . the agenda for this year 's eu-india summit is clear : the eu would like to build up its economic cooperation with india and gain better access to the indian market .
but high import taxes and india 's refusal to set binding prices for certain products have been causing problems .
many european companies are therefore reluctant to invest in india . the indian state still plays a decisive role in the country 's economics , which is why bureaucratic hurdles often impede quick decisions .
india is , above all , interested in important key technologies , such as the it , telecommunications and biotechnology .
additionally , the largest democracy in the world is looking for cooperation possibilities in education and science . but , according to manmohan aggrawal , economic expert from the jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi , both sides need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to improve their bilateral cooperation . " the bilateral relations between the eu and india are good , " aggrawal said .
" but as far as the world trade on the multinational level is concerned , the doha talks faltered .
the indians and the europeans have almost opposing points of view there . " from india 's point of view , the talks should be resumed on a multilateral level , " he added .
" the indian government would like to sink the import taxes , but on the way to a multilateral agreement .
that is because india 's trade is very diverse .
it 's divided almost equally between the usa , europe and asia .
bilateral free trade agreements are therefore not particularly attractive to india . " a popular partner bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is the largest player in the global offshore call center business india is nowadays a much sought after partner .
it is seen not only as an upcoming booming economic power , but also as a country beaming with political self-confidence .
india counts as a reliable partner and , as a regional power , it is a guarantor of stability in southeast asia . during his visit last year to the indian subcontinent in march , us president george w. bush de facto recognized india as a nuclear power .
together with germany , brazil and japan , india has been seeking a permanent seat on the un security council .
and , according to christian wagner of the german institute for international and security affairs , india 's influence on the world stage has actually increased over the past few years . " india has been increasingly trying for several years to play the role of a major power , " wagner said .
" this type of policy has been recognized by the international community .
the very fact that the eu is conducting these bilateral summits and that it has established a strategic partnership with india highlights india 's increasingly important role as a partner in international relations . " advantages over china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india is still struggling with the deficiencies of its infrastructure china - india 's archrival - was for a long time the focus of european attention .
the eu-china summit took place for the ninth time this year .
but the two asian giants are very different from each other . " i think that many companies have discovered that they can do good business in india , " wagner said .
" in addition , india has some advantages over china as far as the legal system and the pervasiveness of the english language are concerned . " on the other hand , there are problems with its infrastructure , " he added .
" i think china is ahead of india there .
another aspect is that the high-level service sector is important in india , whereas processing industries play an important role in china . " within the eu , china has one significant advantage over india because it adopted its liberalization policies before india .
politically , however , india is closer to the eu than china is .
according to wagner , democracy is firmly anchored in india and there are no disagreements on the question of human rights . economic pragmatism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's service sector plays an important role in the country 's economy india 's foreign policy , has nonetheless , caused some irritation in europe .
even though india sided with the us and against its traditional friend iran on the question of nuclear energy , and even though india is playing an important role in the restoration of democracy in nepal , its foreign policy has been occasionally determined by unpredictable economic pragmatism . india , for example , signed energy treaties with the internationally outlawed countries such as sudan and myanmar -lrb- burma -rrb- . " india has so far pushed its own national interests - such as the energy issue - to the foreground , disregarding the issues of democratization and human rights , which are important to the europeans , " wagner said .
" india 's foreign policy is still not animated with the thought of democratic changes , which is what europeans would like to see .
in this respect , india - like china - is pursuing a classical great-power policy .

the case has horrified germans and caused political fallout , as the child was supposed to be in state custody when he died . police are investigating how a two-year-old bremen boy 's body ended up stuffed in three trashbags in his father 's fridge .
the case has caused outrage in germany and raised serious questions about the effectiveness of the country 's child welfare system . a family court had recently ordered that the boy - identified only as kevin - be taken away from his 41-year-old father , a heroin addict known for his violent outbursts . but when welfare officials and the police went to fetch kevin on tuesday , it was already too late .

" in addition , older persons should be able to work longer , said spidla . according to estimates provided by the commissioner , the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- will shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , even taking into account 1.8 million immigrating into the eu every year . by 2050 , the loss of workers is estimated to come to as many as 48 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment , social affairs and equal opportunities commissioner " if we do nothing , two workers have to pay for every retiree , " he said , referring to the current system in which pension plans are supported by payroll contributions made by workers . economic and currency commissioner joaquin almunia called on governments to develop sustainable social models .

" these are two different things . " fewer adoptions in germany while europeans in general are having fewer children , germans are also adopting fewer of them .

" therefore , the number of people wanting to adopt shrinks along with the number of children up for adoption . " whether the declining interest in adoption is also a consequence of artificial insemination could not be determined by the statistics office due to a lack of data . of those adopted last year , around 40 percent are younger than six years of age ; 30 percent were between six and eleven ; and 30 percent were older than 12 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aging germany seeks to prevent a grayer future germany is getting older , but gray hair and wrinkles are the least of its worries .

" in addition , older persons should be able to work longer , said spidla . according to estimates provided by the commissioner , the number of europeans of working age -lrb- between 15 and 64 years old -rrb- will shrink by 20 million by the year 2030 , even taking into account 1.8 million immigrating into the eu every year . by 2050 , the loss of workers is estimated to come to as many as 48 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir spidla , the eu 's employment , social affairs and equal opportunities commissioner " if we do nothing , two workers have to pay for every retiree , " he said , referring to the current system in which pension plans are supported by payroll contributions made by workers . economic and currency commissioner joaquin almunia called on governments to develop sustainable social models .
among eu countries , germany has some of the bloc 's highest pension costs . population issue in all decisions authorities in brussels plan , from now on , to take the issue of demographic development into consideration when drafting new policies .
in addition , every two years a demographic forum will compile information on population development from eu member states .
concrete legal regulations regarding the issue , however , are not planned at present . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors working longer would also please the eu the announcement also spoke of allowing people over the age of 65 to participate longer in economic and social life .
according to spidla , the goal of keeping older workers on the jobs longer does in no way contribute to high youth employment in many eu states . " there is no study that says that young people stand in competition with older ones on the job market , " he said .
" these are two different things . " fewer adoptions in germany while europeans in general are having fewer children , germans are also adopting fewer of them .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden reported on thursday that last year , some 4,800 children were adopted , about half as many as in 1993 . the number of adoptive parents has been decreasing for years .
while at the end of 1993 almost 22,000 couples were on waiting lists for adoptive children , at the end of last year that number was 9,300 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adoption is not as common as it once was johannes vocks , the head of the adoption center in frankfurt , said that one can only speculate about the exact reasons behind the decline . " the birth rate has been sinking for years and the population is growing smaller , " he told ap news agency .
" therefore , the number of people wanting to adopt shrinks along with the number of children up for adoption . " whether the declining interest in adoption is also a consequence of artificial insemination could not be determined by the statistics office due to a lack of data . of those adopted last year , around 40 percent are younger than six years of age ; 30 percent were between six and eleven ; and 30 percent were older than 12 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aging germany seeks to prevent a grayer future germany is getting older , but gray hair and wrinkles are the least of its worries .

" reads the sign next to the entrance of the building where the boy 's body was found on tuesday , a two-year-old boy 's body was found stuffed in a refridgerator .
the case has horrified germans and caused political fallout , as the child was supposed to be in state custody when he died . police are investigating how a two-year-old bremen boy 's body ended up stuffed in three trashbags in his father 's fridge .
the case has caused outrage in germany and raised serious questions about the effectiveness of the country 's child welfare system . a family court had recently ordered that the boy - identified only as kevin - be taken away from his 41-year-old father , a heroin addict known for his violent outbursts . but when welfare officials and the police went to fetch kevin on tuesday , it was already too late .
police found the child 's corpse in the refrigerator . " kevin was under the guardianship of the state .
and we had a responsibility to protect him and take great care in this case but nonetheless we failed to prevent his death , " said bremen 's social affairs senator karin röpke .
" i am deeply troubled by this incident , which will be investigated thoroughly .
we have failed to guarantee the welfare of this child . ” opposition politicians and the press said the local welfare services had failed miserably , as they had last seen kevin alive in july , and should be held to account . röpke , whose department was responsible , resigned wednesday . father under arrest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's social affairs senator karin röpke resigned an autopsy showed the toddler had broken bones in both legs and his left arm as well as blood stains on his skull .
the prosecutor 's office said the exact cause of death was unclear but it appeared that kevin had been dead for at least several days .
outraged members of the public placed flowers and candles outside the apartment block in bremen 's groepeling district where the drama took place . kevin ’ s father , who is being treated with the substitute drug methadone , has been arrested .
according to state prosecutors , he faces charges of manslaughter and abuse of a minor .
he is also under investigation in connection with the death last year of the boy 's mother , who was also a drug user . there have been at least half-a-dozen cases in the last six years where parents in germany have been charged or sentenced to prison terms for causing the death of their children by neglect .
experts estimate there are about 10.000 children living in conditions bordering on neglect in germany , which is one of europe 's richest countries . kerstin winter -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german officials block child murderer 's foundation for children german authorities have prevented a german man infamous for killing an 11-year-old boy in 2002 from setting up a charitable foundation for abused children .

the first un study of global violence against children says such abuse is often socially approved or even legal .
it concludes that violence against under-18s occurs in every country , every society and every social group .
the un has called on states to outlaw violence against children and to ensure their rights are protected .
the study , which was requested by un secretary general kofi annan , is the result of four years of research .
psychological scars the report 's author , professor paulo sergio pinheiro , says the situation revealed is not acceptable and decades of silent abuse can no longer remain unchallenged .
" protection from violence is a matter of urgency , " writes mr pinheiro , " children have suffered adult violence unseen and unheard for centuries . "
the un is calling on every country to have a national strategy to prevent violence against children .
the report , the first of its kind , charts various kinds of violence , from prostitution to school bullying , taking place in different stages and spheres of children 's ' lives - at home , in the community and in institutions .
it estimates that some 150 million girls , 14 % of the planet 's child population , are sexually abused each year , as well as seven percent of boys , or 73 million children .
such violence can leave serious long-term psychological scars which result in increased risky sexual behaviour , substance abuse and violence towards others in adulthood .
hidden violence the study suggests that between 80-93 % of children suffer physical punishment in their homes , although many of them do not speak of it due to stigma , shame and a lack of faith in legal systems .
the home can also be a dangerous place for some of the estimated 82 million girls who marry before the age of 18 and can face violence from their partners .
" there are several modalities of violence that are invisible or there is a wall of silence - violence inside the school , inside the home , at the workplace , the community and institutions , " mr pinheiro told the bbc . "
this is the moment to recognise children as being protected by rights , as full citizens " paulo sergio pinheiro author of the report dr congo children ' armed ' gender also shapes the likelihood of experiencing different types of violence .
a study of 21 mainly developed countries , for example , found that up to 36 % of women and 29 % of men reported being sexually victimised during childhood .
but boys , especially in the 15-17 age group , are up to four times more likely to be murdered than girls of the same age .
the authors said they were encouraged by the participation of 135 governments from across the globe .
but the report recognises that one of the greatest challenges is changing a social mindset that tacitly accepts violence towards minors .
it includes a list of recommendations including the creation of national commissioners to prevent violence against children and national legal frameworks to protect children .
" after the emancipation of the workers in the 19th century , the emancipation of the women in the 20th century , i think that this is the moment to recognise children as being protected by rights , as full citizens , and not as mini-human beings or the property of their families , " mr pinheiro said .

such violence can leave serious long-term psychological scars which result in increased risky sexual behaviour , substance abuse and violence towards others in adulthood .
hidden violence the study suggests that between 80-93 % of children suffer physical punishment in their homes , although many of them do not speak of it due to stigma , shame and a lack of faith in legal systems .
the home can also be a dangerous place for some of the estimated 82 million girls who marry before the age of 18 and can face violence from their partners .
" there are several modalities of violence that are invisible or there is a wall of silence - violence inside the school , inside the home , at the workplace , the community and institutions , " mr pinheiro told the bbc .
this is the moment to recognise children as being protected by rights , as full citizens paulo sergio pinheiro author of the report dr congo children ' armed ' gender also shapes the likelihood of experiencing different types of violence .
a study of 21 mainly developed countries , for example , found that up to 36 % of women and 29 % of men reported being sexually victimised during childhood .
but boys , especially in the 15-17 age group , are up to four times more likely to be murdered than girls of the same age .
the authors said they were encouraged by the participation of 135 governments from across the globe .
but the report recognises that one of the greatest challenges is changing a social mindset that tacitly accepts violence towards minors .
it includes a list of recommendations including the creation of national commissioners to prevent violence against children and national legal frameworks to protect children .
" after the emancipation of the workers in the 19th century , the emancipation of the women in the 20th century , i think that this is the moment to recognise children as being protected by rights , as full citizens , and not as mini-human beings or the property of their families , " mr pinheiro said .

the new chief executive of the wales ambulance trust last month said the service needed £ 140m long term investment , including new vehicles .
the funding will pay for 119 new ambulances and 67 other patient vehicles over the next few months .
a public inquiry into the service , described as " in crisis " by a previous chief executive , is still ongoing .
health minister dr brian gibbons , who is visiting an ambulance station in llangefni , said : " we 've heard many times over recent months that the ambulance service in wales needs to modernise .
" this funding is a first step towards seeing that modernisation happen . "
dr gibbons said the trust was working through a plan which would ensure " that the men and women who provide this important service are supported by a modern organisation and that performance and response times of the ambulances can improve to meet all our expectations " .
mr murray said the dedication of staff has been " inspiring " the ambulances will be equipped with the latest life-saving equipment , which some of the current vehicles lack .
ambulance trust chief executive alan murray said the investment would " ensure that its vehicles are more efficient and fitted with the latest medical equipment to provide the care patients need " .
mr murray started work in august after months of turmoil for the service .

big cats - thought to be a panther and a puma - were on the loose on the north coast .
numerous sightings , paw prints and the mauled remains of livestock - including a 70kg ram - seemed to confirm their presence .
the uspca believes there are pumas living in the ni countryside since then the creatures have disappeared from view , but according to the ulster society for the prevention of cruelty to animals , others are living in the wild in northern ireland .
" there are reported sightings from across the province that would suggest we still have a few of these animals in the wild , " uspca chief executive stephen philpott said .
" probably pumas and lynx , smallish animals that could survive in our climate and live by scavenging or -lrb- feeding -rrb- on smaller native mammals .
" they are secretive and shy and only present a problem if cornered , a situation they are equipped by instinct to avoid . "
mr philpott said reports about such animals are usually received from rural communities in counties tyrone , down and antrim " they originated from private hands having been bought from dealers .
remember it is not illegal to possess these creatures , " he added .
in 1976 the dangerous wild animals act became law in england and wales .
it meant licences were required for anyone wishing to own an animal listed under the act .
it aimed to ensure that where individuals own dangerous or exotic animals they do so in circumstances which create no risk to the public and safeguard the welfare of the animals however , the act does not apply to northern ireland .
as a result it is perfectly legal to own anything which is n't listed as endangered , something which some people in northern ireland have taken advantage of .
" fashions change in animal keeping and the passion for a lion or tiger in the garden shed in the 70s and 80s gave way to a demand for exotic animals perceived as less demanding , creatures such as eagle owls , wolves and non-venomous snakes , " mr philpott said this sheep was thought to have been killed by a big cat in north antrim " things have moved on and easy availability through the internet and local dealers means reptiles , spiders and monkeys , even caiman crocodiles , are on display in local living rooms impressing the neighbours . "
after the big cat sightings in 2003 the government moved to bring northern ireland in line with the rest of the uk , but although it is more than two years since an order in council was published , the legislation has still not come into law .
in that time the uspca has seized wolves , venomous snakes and toads , crocodiles , monkeys and poisonous spiders from pet shops and private homes across northern ireland .
these include two wolves running loose in a bangor housing estate .
recently the charity also discovered five juvenile diamond back rattlesnakes in a house in east antrim .
the uspca has long called for the law on dangerous animals to be changed in northern ireland , but it is also concerned about the aftermath of the change .
the worry is that dangerous animals could be dumped into the northern ireland countryside and the charity wants the government to make some arrangements to house such animals .
it also says changing the law will be pointless unless it is effectively policed .
" we have for some years had dangerous dogs order in ni .
this was designed to control and eliminate a real threat to public safety , " stephen philpott said .
people are buying caiman crocodiles as pets " it has not been effectively applied and the keeping of dangerous dogs is endemic in many parts of the province . "
northern ireland 's farmers are the people with most to fear from the release of dangerous animals into the countryside .
joe mcdonald of the ulster farmers union said the dangerous wild animals act is needed in northern ireland , but urged owners of such animals to behave sensibly when it is brought in .
" we would certainly urge anyone who is a keeper of an animal to take the responsibility of ownership and not to release them into the wild .
" our countryside is predominantly farmland and it is not really a suitable environment for certain types of these wild animals and it seems to have caused big problems in the past , " mr mcdonald said .
" we 'd far rather they try to find some sort of official outlet for the animal rather than to just let it loose and create all sorts of other knock-on problems . "
and what of those two wild cats which hit the news in 2003 ?
no more sightings have been reported recently , but the uspca believes they could have survived in the wild .
however , they are likely to have " melted away into the background " .
their headline-making days seem to be behind them .

big cats - thought to be a panther and a puma - were on the loose on the north coast .
numerous sightings , paw prints and the mauled remains of livestock - including a 70kg ram - seemed to confirm their presence .
the uspca believes there are pumas living in the ni countryside since then the creatures have disappeared from view , but according to the ulster society for the prevention of cruelty to animals , others are living in the wild in northern ireland .
" there are reported sightings from across the province that would suggest we still have a few of these animals in the wild , " uspca chief executive stephen philpott said .
" probably pumas and lynx , smallish animals that could survive in our climate and live by scavenging or -lrb- feeding -rrb- on smaller native mammals .
" they are secretive and shy and only present a problem if cornered , a situation they are equipped by instinct to avoid . "
mr philpott said reports about such animals are usually received from rural communities in counties tyrone , down and antrim " they originated from private hands having been bought from dealers .
remember it is not illegal to possess these creatures , " he added .
in 1976 the dangerous wild animals act became law in england and wales .
it meant licences were required for anyone wishing to own an animal listed under the act .
it aimed to ensure that where individuals own dangerous or exotic animals they do so in circumstances which create no risk to the public and safeguard the welfare of the animals however , the act does not apply to northern ireland .
as a result it is perfectly legal to own anything which is n't listed as endangered , something which some people in northern ireland have taken advantage of .
" fashions change in animal keeping and the passion for a lion or tiger in the garden shed in the 70s and 80s gave way to a demand for exotic animals perceived as less demanding , creatures such as eagle owls , wolves and non-venomous snakes , " mr philpott said this sheep was thought to have been killed by a big cat in north antrim " things have moved on and easy availability through the internet and local dealers means reptiles , spiders and monkeys , even caiman crocodiles , are on display in local living rooms impressing the neighbours . "
after the big cat sightings in 2003 the government moved to bring northern ireland in line with the rest of the uk , but although it is more than two years since an order in council was published , the legislation has still not come into law .
in that time the uspca has seized wolves , venomous snakes and toads , crocodiles , monkeys and poisonous spiders from pet shops and private homes across northern ireland .
these include two wolves running loose in a bangor housing estate .
recently the charity also discovered five juvenile diamond back rattlesnakes in a house in east antrim .
the uspca has long called for the law on dangerous animals to be changed in northern ireland , but it is also concerned about the aftermath of the change .
the worry is that dangerous animals could be dumped into the northern ireland countryside and the charity wants the government to make some arrangements to house such animals .
it also says changing the law will be pointless unless it is effectively policed .
" we have for some years had dangerous dogs order in ni .
this was designed to control and eliminate a real threat to public safety , " stephen philpott said .
people are buying caiman crocodiles as pets " it has not been effectively applied and the keeping of dangerous dogs is endemic in many parts of the province . "
northern ireland 's farmers are the people with most to fear from the release of dangerous animals into the countryside .
joe mcdonald of the ulster farmers union said the dangerous wild animals act is needed in northern ireland , but urged owners of such animals to behave sensibly when it is brought in .
" we would certainly urge anyone who is a keeper of an animal to take the responsibility of ownership and not to release them into the wild .
" our countryside is predominantly farmland and it is not really a suitable environment for certain types of these wild animals and it seems to have caused big problems in the past , " mr mcdonald said .
" we 'd far rather they try to find some sort of official outlet for the animal rather than to just let it loose and create all sorts of other knock-on problems . "
and what of those two wild cats which hit the news in 2003 ?
no more sightings have been reported recently , but the uspca believes they could have survived in the wild .
however , they are likely to have " melted away into the background " .
their headline-making days seem to be behind them .

big cats - thought to be a panther and a puma - were on the loose on the north coast .
numerous sightings , paw prints and the mauled remains of livestock - including a 70kg ram - seemed to confirm their presence .
the uspca believes there are pumas living in the ni countryside since then the creatures have disappeared from view , but according to the ulster society for the prevention of cruelty to animals , others are living in the wild in northern ireland .
" there are reported sightings from across the province that would suggest we still have a few of these animals in the wild , " uspca chief executive stephen philpott said .
" probably pumas and lynx , smallish animals that could survive in our climate and live by scavenging or -lrb- feeding -rrb- on smaller native mammals .
" they are secretive and shy and only present a problem if cornered , a situation they are equipped by instinct to avoid . "
mr philpott said reports about such animals are usually received from rural communities in counties tyrone , down and antrim " they originated from private hands having been bought from dealers .
remember it is not illegal to possess these creatures , " he added .
in 1976 the dangerous wild animals act became law in england and wales .
it meant licences were required for anyone wishing to own an animal listed under the act .
it aimed to ensure that where individuals own dangerous or exotic animals they do so in circumstances which create no risk to the public and safeguard the welfare of the animals however , the act does not apply to northern ireland .
as a result it is perfectly legal to own anything which is n't listed as endangered , something which some people in northern ireland have taken advantage of .
" fashions change in animal keeping and the passion for a lion or tiger in the garden shed in the 70s and 80s gave way to a demand for exotic animals perceived as less demanding , creatures such as eagle owls , wolves and non-venomous snakes , " mr philpott said this sheep was thought to have been killed by a big cat in north antrim " things have moved on and easy availability through the internet and local dealers means reptiles , spiders and monkeys , even caiman crocodiles , are on display in local living rooms impressing the neighbours . "
after the big cat sightings in 2003 the government moved to bring northern ireland in line with the rest of the uk , but although it is more than two years since an order in council was published , the legislation has still not come into law .
in that time the uspca has seized wolves , venomous snakes and toads , crocodiles , monkeys and poisonous spiders from pet shops and private homes across northern ireland .
these include two wolves running loose in a bangor housing estate .
recently the charity also discovered five juvenile diamond back rattlesnakes in a house in east antrim .
the uspca has long called for the law on dangerous animals to be changed in northern ireland , but it is also concerned about the aftermath of the change .
the worry is that dangerous animals could be dumped into the northern ireland countryside and the charity wants the government to make some arrangements to house such animals .
it also says changing the law will be pointless unless it is effectively policed .
" we have for some years had dangerous dogs order in ni .
this was designed to control and eliminate a real threat to public safety , " stephen philpott said .
people are buying caiman crocodiles as pets " it has not been effectively applied and the keeping of dangerous dogs is endemic in many parts of the province . "
northern ireland 's farmers are the people with most to fear from the release of dangerous animals into the countryside .
joe mcdonald of the ulster farmers union said the dangerous wild animals act is needed in northern ireland , but urged owners of such animals to behave sensibly when it is brought in .
" we would certainly urge anyone who is a keeper of an animal to take the responsibility of ownership and not to release them into the wild .
" our countryside is predominantly farmland and it is not really a suitable environment for certain types of these wild animals and it seems to have caused big problems in the past , " mr mcdonald said .
" we 'd far rather they try to find some sort of official outlet for the animal rather than to just let it loose and create all sorts of other knock-on problems . "
and what of those two wild cats which hit the news in 2003 ?
no more sightings have been reported recently , but the uspca believes they could have survived in the wild .
however , they are likely to have " melted away into the background " .
their headline-making days seem to be behind them .

the ruling union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- is not backing the law , but has given its deputies a free vote , and analysts say it is likely to pass .

france 's president chirac and interior minister nicolas sarkozy have both said turkey will have to change that position and recognise the armenian deaths as genocide before it joins the eu .
turks argue that while the eu is pressuring turkey to improve its legislation to ensure full freedom of speech france seems to be moving in the opposite direction .
arguments have raged for decades about the armenian deaths turkey 's parliament is now considering a law that would make it a crime to deny french killings in algeria in 1945 as genocide .

france has about 500,000 people of armenian descent - thought to be the largest armenian immigrant community in western europe .

but he told the bbc 's world today programme that the new bill was unnecessary .
" i can not give my vote to a completely stupid law which will punish somebody who expressed free judgement concerning historical facts .
it 's not acceptable .
" we have to help turkey to accept , progressively , what was history .
i think that this provocation of the french parliament will not help the consciousness in turkey , " he said .

leighton moss nature reserve , near carnforth , is the first place in the north-west england to undergo the work by united utilities .
regulator ofgem has agreed £ 5m funding in the region for the " makeovers " in picturesque spots .
it is the first time united utilities has been given funding to relay power lines for purely aesthetic reasons .
leighton moss is owned by the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- .
its wetlands are home to rare species of birds , including the bittern and bearded tit .
we have to dig carefully and ensure we leave things just as we found them eddie hamilton united utilities the scheme involves removing 11 poles and almost a mile of overhead lines , which supply 11,000 volts of power to residents and businesses .
eddie hamilton , united utilities project manager , said : " this is just the first phase of a pioneering project that will make a subtle yet permanent difference to areas of beautiful landscape in the north west .
" it will be very challenging - by the very nature of what we are doing these sites are all environmentally sensitive , so we have to dig carefully and ensure that we leave things just as we found them . "
as well as improving the appearance of the site , the work at leighton moss will help stop birds being killed on power lines .
robin horner , rspb reserves area manager , said : " the area can only be improved by the disappearance of the power lines and i 'm sure that our visitors will notice the difference . "
the complete programme of work includes areas in the lake district national park and forest of bowland , and will be completed by 2010 .

only two of 570 bodies assessed , both of them hospitals , were ranked as excellent in both categories .
the healthcare commission said its " broad and tough " analysis showed the nhs needed to " raise its game " .
the body representing nhs managers said underperforming trusts could now focus on areas where improvement was needed .

factors assessed for the quality of service ranking included clinical care , meeting government targets and areas such as children 's health , hospital acquired infection rates and community mental health care .
the financial management rating took into account both whether or not the nhs body had a deficit , but also how it ran its finances more generally .

eight hospitals were ranked as weak on both quality of service and financial management .
