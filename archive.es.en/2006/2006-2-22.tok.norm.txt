a german parliamentary commission is meeting wednesday behind closed doors to examine the role of the country 's secret service in the iraq war . opposition parties in the parliamentary control commission reviewing the role of the german intelligence service in iraq are dissatisfied with the government 's report on the issue .
members of the green and left parties said the official response to their questions was inadequate .
the german government handed over its report to the control commission earlier this week .
the commission is discussing the report behind closed doors on wednesday . the body 's green party representative , christian ströbele , said prior to the meeting he would seek a minority vote on the report . " the report does not meet my approval , " ströbele told the newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" we have to clarify if something is still open . " the report looks at the role of the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- in iraq , the cia 's abduction of german citizen khaled el-masri and secret cia flights in europe , as well as prisoner interrogations abroad by german investigators . commission seeks maximum transparency the commission will decide whether to call for a formal parliamentary probe after they 've discussed the report . but the commission 's left party representative , wolfgang neskovic , said a parliamentary inquiry to clarify the bnd affair was necessary .
he told german radio rbb-inforadio that the commission did not have " the necessary clarification instruments " that an inquiry would .
the commission could only draw on that information relinquished by the government , neskovic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission needs to clarify what the bnd did in iraq the federal government and the commission will jointly decide how much of the report will be made public .
but the opposition would like as much transparency as possible .
should the government 's information not satisfy the commission , a formal parliamentary probe is still an option . berlin failed to provide a clear answer on masri german prosecutors said they were investigating whether the government knew - sooner than it admitted - that the cia had wrongfully detained el-masri . " we are investigating this , " said christian schmidt-sommerfeld , chief state prosecutor in the southern city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri said undercover us agents mistakenly detained him the german government has for months faced allegations that it may have joined forces with the cia in the case of 42-year-old masri , who was held in afghanistan for five months as a suspected terrorist .
but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied a cover-up , saying late last year that berlin only learnt of the episode after the cia released masri in may 2004 . schmidt-sommerfeld said the government has been asked to clarify the matter .
although it has responded , it has so far failed to provide a clear answer , he said . masri has meanwhile claimed that one of the men who interrogated him while he was in afghanistan was a high-ranking member of the german police .
schmidt-sommerfeld said masri identified the policeman from photographs .
but when they met face to face earlier this week in new ulm - the southern german town where the former detainee lives - he could not be " absolutely sure " that it was the man who questioned him . " we need absolute certainty , " the prosecutor said .
he said his office would also try to establish whether the policeman was in afghanistan at the time . masri , an unemployed car salesman , claims he was drugged , questioned and tortured in a prison camp in afghanistan and later released without explanation in albania .
he has filed a lawsuit against the cia , demanding at least $ 75,000 dollars in damages . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us intelligence allegedly bugged german agents in iraq a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 .

germany launches world cup charm offensive germans gloomy about the future current affairs -pipe- 22.02.2006 germany ends nationwide pep talk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was everyone this excited ?
germany 's national pep talk campaign " du bist deutschland " has come to an end .
to its creators , it was an unparalleled success .
to comedians , a bottomless well of material . after thousands of minutes of air time , as many pages of newsprint , and - likely - as many people who took delight in trashing its message , germany 's five-month nationwide pep talk campaign has come to an end . the privately-sponsored 30-million-euro -lrb- $ 25-million -rrb- campaign , " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- reached 58 percent of the population , according to a sample poll commissioned by the creators .
forty percent of those polled said they appreciated the television and print spots in which sports , literary , tv and film personalities urged germans to take a personal stake in lifting the country ' spirits . but have they ? journalists and late-night show hosts , who took delight in slamming the feel-good vibe of the campaign , certainly have n't .
a campaign spokesman said it had been caricatured at least 300 times .
the labor union ig metall even printed postcards using the slogan to criticize changes in the labor market .
it was mocked for being everything from " kindergarten-like " to nazi-like , and got little support from the very industry responsible for its incarnation . mission accomplished creators jung von matt appear unperturbed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : du bist deutschland placard featuring albert einstein " we reached our goal , " wrote oliver voss , the creative head of the german pr agency in last sunday 's welt am sonntag .
" we wanted nothing else than that germany talks with itself and about itself . " but are germans more motivated about solving the country 's problems - from bad attitudes to unemployment - than before ?
the answer was nowhere to be found in the analysis by consumer-research group gfk - and likely never will be determined by any study . the creators do n't seem to mind .
after all , all publicity is good publicity .
and with close to 40 million people happy with its message , bertelsmann manager gunter thielen - the campaign 's originator - thinks it 's worth a second run . but thielen said he would n't continue to lead it .

he said the structure of the german education system fosters inequalities . the investigation was prompted by allegations that school students with immigrant and low-income backgrounds are hugely disadvantaged in primary schools in germany and that they have little chance to obtain academic qualifications . munoz said that it was difficult for outsiders to see through the german school system .
since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .
" but here as anywhere else poor people tend to care less about education .
in germany , however , this tendency is further aggravated by the fact that individual selection of specific schools starts very early in life .

munoz said that compared with other countries strikingly few of these children would be able reach academic qualifications . also , stringent school selection procedures , starting at as young an age as eight or nine , foster school careers based on the will of parents rather than pupils ' merits , he said . " i would recommend a careful rethinking of the federal structures in the german school system , " he said .

" our education system will change so that all pupils can decide on their school careers at every age , " schavan said .
" this will overcome the differences and inequalities that still exist today . " german parents organizations welcomed munoz 's visit and said that hints from outside were needed at this stage .

" the board considers that it -lrb- the offer -rrb- does not adequately reflect the true value of endesa , " the company said , while still welcoming the fact " the operation proposed by e.on maintains the integrity of endesa 's industrial project , without offloading shares . " the bid came after the spanish government had on feb .
3 given its blessing to a rival bid from spanish utility gas natural , which was 29 percent lower than e.on 's at 22.5-billion euros . gas natural responded to e.on 's entrance into the fray by saying it was continuing with its bid . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero threw the bid into further doubt when he said he wanted to retain national ownership of spain 's energy providers .
zapatero late tuesday held lengthy talks with e.on chairman wulf bernotat to discuss the takeover offer for his country 's leading electricity group and insisted he wanted to see spanish energy utilities remain in spanish hands , according to spanish government sources . el mundo newspaper 's web site said zapatero had told bernotat he was " worried " about the bid . responding to zapatero 's concerns about maintaining key sectors in spanish hands , gas natural said it wanted to create a company " with the capacity to compete at european and world level and with the capacity to maintain its centre of decision-making in spain . " combined energy giant would service 50 million clients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's takeover would create a world leader e.on 's all-cash offer , which would create the world 's leading power and gas supplier , risks upsetting zapatero 's plans to create a national champion in the spanish energy sector which could compete internationally in a consolidated market . the germans have offered 27.50 euros -lrb- $ 32.75 -rrb- per share compared with gas natural 's 21.30 euros per share , but the latter insisted tuesday that its own bid was in the interests of the electricity company 's shareholders and spain in general . the combination of e.on and endesa would create a group with 50 million customers and 107,000 employees , putting it ahead of companies such as electricite de france -lrb- edf -rrb- , tokyo electric , rwe , enel and suez , the german group said . the e.on takeover bid , announced tuesday in germany , had appeared to take madrid by surprise and analysts saw the cash bid as a blow to madrid 's support for " strong energy enterprises " at global level . a finance ministry spokesman earlier had told reporters it was " not very likely " the government would intervene , despite having a " golden share " in endesa through june 2007 that would enable it to block e.on. the spokesman said madrid was " totally neutral " on the german offer . the european union has ruled such state holdings illegal , and the ministry spokesman pointed out that madrid was debating the passage of legislation to bring spanish law in to line to meet the eu stricture . any obstruction could anger eu over liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy commissioner andris piebalgs wants more liberalization if the spanish government were to intervene and obstruct the bid it could spark a europe-wide political row .
some analysts believe the eu would accuse madrid of standing in the way of consolidation in europe 's energy markets . the european commission has been pushing for market liberalization reforms in the energy sector and has reportedly been getting increasingly impatient due to what it views as a widespread lack of progress in the implementation of reforms by member states . energy commissioner andris piebalgs said last week that the eu executive will issue warnings against three member states over slow implementation by the end of march without naming names , although unconfirmed reports suggest e.on and fellow german utility rwe ag as well as france 's edf , and italy 's enel spa have been accused of blocking competitors from operating on fair terms in their home markets . in its reaction , endesa 's board said " the price offered by e.on is clearly better than the rival gas natural bid but the board considers that it -lrb- the offer -rrb- does not adequately reflect the true value of endesa , " endesa said . madrid wants strong spanish enterprises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's government would respect the energy sector 's rules spanish secretary of state for communication fernando moraleda said madrid wanted to see the creation of " strong enterprises with spanish capital on board and with a capacity to compete on international markets . " asked about future government policy regarding endesa , moraleda added that madrid respected the rules of the market . senior ruling socialist party official alfredo perez rubalcaba said madrid would apply " the same criteria " to the case as it had earlier with gas natural , saying that what counted was " the general interest , the interests of consumers and the strategic character of the sector . " however , the main conservative opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which said it had detected regional politicking in the original deal since the government has allies in the catalan region that is home to gas natural , accused the government of being " the only ones responsible " for the german counter-bid . there had been contradictory signs in spain concerning the gas natural bid .
the market regulator approved the deal but with conditions while the competition regulator was opposed . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany not affected by russian gas dispute even though russia is the largest supplier of natural gas to germany , consumers here have no reason to worry that their supplies will suffer as a consequence of the russian-ukrainian dispute .

he said the structure of the german education system fosters inequalities . the investigation was prompted by allegations that school students with immigrant and low-income backgrounds are hugely disadvantaged in primary schools in germany and that they have little chance to obtain academic qualifications . munoz said that it was difficult for outsiders to see through the german school system .
since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .
" but here as anywhere else poor people tend to care less about education .
in germany , however , this tendency is further aggravated by the fact that individual selection of specific schools starts very early in life . " oecd study highlights problems munoz pointed to an oecd study in the year 2000 that in his view showed a correlation between the german school system and poor results of its pupils .
in the study , german 15-year-olds were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will their backgrounds decide their academic future ?
the study also highlighted major inequalities in the school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers .
munoz said that compared with other countries strikingly few of these children would be able reach academic qualifications . also , stringent school selection procedures , starting at as young an age as eight or nine , foster school careers based on the will of parents rather than pupils ' merits , he said . " i would recommend a careful rethinking of the federal structures in the german school system , " he said .
" they are inhomogeneous and lead to inequalities .
the same applies to the school selection process .
at such an early stage it is unable to use the full potentials of pupils to their best . " reforms already under way germany 's education minister , anette schavan , underlined that major reforms to the system were already underway in all federal states .
they would resolve some of the problems touched on by munoz , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will school uniforms serve as equalizers ?
" our education system will change so that all pupils can decide on their school careers at every age , " schavan said .
" this will overcome the differences and inequalities that still exist today . " german parents organizations welcomed munoz 's visit and said that hints from outside were needed at this stage .
the parents also said that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un probes german school inequality the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .

" the continuation of our economic relations must take place in a reliable environment , " steinmeier said at a news conference in peking during his first state trip to china . copyright concerns have grown in the past week following the announcement by a chinese company that it will build a magnetic levitation train to compete with the one siemens runs in shanghai . though no one accused the chinese of stealing the technology from siemens , european companies have often encountered outright theft when it comes to their technology patents . china issues strong iran statement li zhaoxing 's promise will be part of the discussion in a new bilateral commission created to encourage " strategic dialogue " between the two countries announced on wednesday . also part of the future dialogue would be china 's human rights situation , which steinmeier only briefly touched on , and china 's immense dependency on raw materials .

he said they would wait until the report by the international atomic energy association at the beginning of march . merkel will visit in may " we have to use this time , " he said .
steinmeier , in japan on tuesday , did not rule out the possibility of sanctions . the repeal of the eu weapon 's embargo on china - a favorite demand by steinmeier 's former boss , chancellor gerhard schröder - is not supported by merkel 's government .

the strategy is highly controversial among experts and had previously been rejected by the eu as an appropriate way to stop the spread of the virus in domesticated bird populations . " our current methods of vaccination only mask the disease , " german agriculture minister horst seehofer told reporters outside of a meeting of eu agricultural ministers this week . critics argue that the vaccine does n't prevent the poultry from catching the virus , though the vaccine does enable the virus to spread undetected through bird populations because the symptoms are reduced . sparing the poultry industry but french and dutch officials remain resolute .
holland 's poultry industry was devastated by an outbreak of a similar virus in 2003 .
after starting in belgium , the virus forced poultry farmers to cull 30 million birds in order to avoid further contamination . " each decision is a weighing of the advantages and the disadvantages , " said johan bongers , a veterinarian at the central institute for animal disease control in lelystad , the netherlands .

vaccines have been used effectively in southeast asia - where h5n1 has been wreaking havoc since 2003 - but only as an additional measure to culling . european union regulations at the moment continue to favor culling . once a domesticated bird has been infected , health officials are required to set up a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- buffer zone around the affected farm .
owners of that farm , as well as any other farm with potential for infection are required to kill their poultry stocks . farmers in germany on the northern island of rügen , where the first infected swan was discovered , have already killed 2,500 birds as a precautionary measure . bad times ahead for kliewe 's farm " that is a hard measure maybe , but there should be no hesitation , " said cees vermeeren , of the brussels-based european poultry lobbying organization avec , which does n't recommend vaccination .
" if you hesitate at the beginning , then you have lost the battle . " but culling also means massive economic losses for poultry farmers , something france - ­ the world 's fourth-largest poultry producer - ­ is eager to avoid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culling could cost the poultry industry tens of millions of euros poultry farmers in northern germany are already feeling the impact .
on sunday , holger kliewe was forced to kill 2,000 of the geese , ducks and chickens he breeds to sell to the tourists who come to his farm and hotel . " i can understand these measures because we have regular visitors , products that we sell from our farm , and we have a restaurant , " said kliewe . but , he added , " our means of production have been taken away completely . "
for a farmer like kliewe , that means a loss of 70 percent of his income .
the other 30 percent , tourism , is taking a hit as well . no alarm , yet " all of us on rügen are suffering from a tarnished image , " kliewe said , adding that guests have already called to cancel their easter vacation reservations .

china has also indicated a harder line on iran . the question of copyright infringement is one of the west 's biggest concerns about investing in china . so when german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday won a pledge from his chinese counterpart to work harder at stemming the problem , the group of executives accompanying him must have breathed a sigh of relief . " the continuation of our economic relations must take place in a reliable environment , " steinmeier said at a news conference in peking during his first state trip to china . copyright concerns have grown in the past week following the announcement by a chinese company that it will build a magnetic levitation train to compete with the one siemens runs in shanghai . though no one accused the chinese of stealing the technology from siemens , european companies have often encountered outright theft when it comes to their technology patents . china issues strong iran statement li zhaoxing 's promise will be part of the discussion in a new bilateral commission created to encourage " strategic dialogue " between the two countries announced on wednesday . also part of the future dialogue would be china 's human rights situation , which steinmeier only briefly touched on , and china 's immense dependency on raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier and li zhaoxing steinmeier was unable to get as much commitment on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
should all diplomatic avenues shut down , the us and eu-3 support referring the matter of iran 's nuclear program to the un security council where they would seek economic sanctions against the islamic republic .
a russian and chinese veto stand in the way . earlier this week , a chinese foreign ministry spokesman issued the country 's strongest statement yet on iran - urging teheran to once again suspend uranium-enriching activities it had taken up in january , defying the international community . on wednesday , li appealed for a diplomatic solution but said that china would not rush in deciding how to best deal with iran .
he said they would wait until the report by the international atomic energy association at the beginning of march . merkel will visit in may " we have to use this time , " he said .
steinmeier , in japan on tuesday , did not rule out the possibility of sanctions . the repeal of the eu weapon 's embargo on china - a favorite demand by steinmeier 's former boss , chancellor gerhard schröder - is not supported by merkel 's government .
but china said it will continue to press germany for its support .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bird flu : the continuing threat germany 's media tangle with bird flu bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion the westward migration of bird flu bird flu : the facts europe -pipe- 22.02.2006 europe diverges on how to stop spread of bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and the netherlands want to go ahead with bird vaccinations past brushes and the devastation wreaked in asia have taught europe the dangers that bird flu brings with it .
but there are differing notions in the eu on how best to stop its march . given europe 's difficulty on agreeing on most things , it should probably come as no surprise that eu members have different ideas on how best to stop the spread of bird flu . on wednesday , france and the netherlands received permission from the eu to begin vaccinating their bird populations against the avian virus h5n1 .
the strategy is highly controversial among experts and had previously been rejected by the eu as an appropriate way to stop the spread of the virus in domesticated bird populations . " our current methods of vaccination only mask the disease , " german agriculture minister horst seehofer told reporters outside of a meeting of eu agricultural ministers this week . critics argue that the vaccine does n't prevent the poultry from catching the virus , though the vaccine does enable the virus to spread undetected through bird populations because the symptoms are reduced . sparing the poultry industry but french and dutch officials remain resolute .
holland 's poultry industry was devastated by an outbreak of a similar virus in 2003 .
after starting in belgium , the virus forced poultry farmers to cull 30 million birds in order to avoid further contamination . " each decision is a weighing of the advantages and the disadvantages , " said johan bongers , a veterinarian at the central institute for animal disease control in lelystad , the netherlands .
" we know what it is to have avian influenza , we know how difficult it is to eradicate it .
that 's why we are in favor of vaccination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preventative measures are being undertaken in germany bongers admits that the vaccines are not optimal .
but he says improvements are being worked on at the moment .
vaccines have been used effectively in southeast asia - where h5n1 has been wreaking havoc since 2003 - but only as an additional measure to culling . european union regulations at the moment continue to favor culling . once a domesticated bird has been infected , health officials are required to set up a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- buffer zone around the affected farm .
owners of that farm , as well as any other farm with potential for infection are required to kill their poultry stocks . farmers in germany on the northern island of rügen , where the first infected swan was discovered , have already killed 2,500 birds as a precautionary measure . bad times ahead for kliewe 's farm " that is a hard measure maybe , but there should be no hesitation , " said cees vermeeren , of the brussels-based european poultry lobbying organization avec , which does n't recommend vaccination .
" if you hesitate at the beginning , then you have lost the battle . " but culling also means massive economic losses for poultry farmers , something france - ­ the world 's fourth-largest poultry producer - ­ is eager to avoid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culling could cost the poultry industry tens of millions of euros poultry farmers in northern germany are already feeling the impact .
on sunday , holger kliewe was forced to kill 2,000 of the geese , ducks and chickens he breeds to sell to the tourists who come to his farm and hotel . " i can understand these measures because we have regular visitors , products that we sell from our farm , and we have a restaurant , " said kliewe . but , he added , " our means of production have been taken away completely . "
for a farmer like kliewe , that means a loss of 70 percent of his income .
the other 30 percent , tourism , is taking a hit as well . no alarm , yet " all of us on rügen are suffering from a tarnished image , " kliewe said , adding that guests have already called to cancel their easter vacation reservations .
" the anti-flu measures will convince no one to come to the island in the near future .
that 's why we need this crisis to be contained as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen is worried about a tarnished image eu officials remain confident exactly that will happen .

germany launches world cup charm offensive germans gloomy about the future current affairs -pipe- 22.02.2006 germany ends nationwide pep talk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was everyone this excited ?
germany 's national pep talk campaign " du bist deutschland " has come to an end .
to its creators , it was an unparalleled success .
to comedians , a bottomless well of material . after thousands of minutes of air time , as many pages of newsprint , and - likely - as many people who took delight in trashing its message , germany 's five-month nationwide pep talk campaign has come to an end . the privately-sponsored 30-million-euro -lrb- $ 25-million -rrb- campaign , " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- reached 58 percent of the population , according to a sample poll commissioned by the creators .
forty percent of those polled said they appreciated the television and print spots in which sports , literary , tv and film personalities urged germans to take a personal stake in lifting the country ' spirits . but have they ? journalists and late-night show hosts , who took delight in slamming the feel-good vibe of the campaign , certainly have n't .
a campaign spokesman said it had been caricatured at least 300 times .
the labor union ig metall even printed postcards using the slogan to criticize changes in the labor market .
it was mocked for being everything from " kindergarten-like " to nazi-like , and got little support from the very industry responsible for its incarnation . mission accomplished creators jung von matt appear unperturbed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : du bist deutschland placard featuring albert einstein " we reached our goal , " wrote oliver voss , the creative head of the german pr agency in last sunday 's welt am sonntag .
" we wanted nothing else than that germany talks with itself and about itself . " but are germans more motivated about solving the country 's problems - from bad attitudes to unemployment - than before ?
the answer was nowhere to be found in the analysis by consumer-research group gfk - and likely never will be determined by any study . the creators do n't seem to mind .
after all , all publicity is good publicity .
and with close to 40 million people happy with its message , bertelsmann manager gunter thielen - the campaign 's originator - thinks it 's worth a second run . but thielen said he would n't continue to lead it .
" it 's time for others to push it forward , " he said . given the study results , it should n't be that difficult to find someone . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi photo trips up confidence campaign the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces .
-lrb- nov .
24 , 2005 -rrb- do n't worry , be happy … or you 're fired !
some say germany is a nation of complainers .
one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country .
-lrb- nov .
9 , 2005 -rrb- campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .
but now leading german media organizations have launched a new initiative to help lift their spirits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.02.2006 confusion surrounds reports of serbian war criminal 's capture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic and bosnian serb leader karadzic are among the world 's most wanted criminals the fate of top war crime fugitive ratko mladic remained unclear as serbian media said wednesday he was closer to custody than ever since being indicted for genocide a decade ago .
but the government denied his arrest . conflicting reports dominated newspapers in the serbian capital on wednesday that the former bosnian serb general ratko mladic had been located , arrested and was even already on his way to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague . but the serbian government and police denied he was arrested , as did the tribunal 's chief prosecutor , carla del ponte . " mladic arrested , " read the only headline on the front page of nationalist daily glas javnosti with the general 's picture across the page . " ratko mladic and his bodyguard were arrested in a belgrade apartment , where negotiations on his voluntary surrender had been previously held , " the daily said , quoting a source close to serbian authorities . but the largest-circulation daily vecernje novosti only said that the noose had tightened on the fugitive , as " all political preparations for the arrest are completed and mladic is given only a little bit more time to decide to surrender . "
otherwise , he would be arrested by special police forces , the paper said . the influential pro-government politika daily cited anonymous sources as saying " the operation of capturing mladic started around 3:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0230 gmt -rrb- on tuesday in new belgrade , near a luxurious hotel . "
but it did not report on the end of the operation . reports of mladic 's arrest are " manipulation " some serbian and bosnian serb media reported that mladic had been located at cer mountain , some 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- west of belgrade .
negotiations were now underway on his surrender , they said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic allegedly ordered the murder of thousands of muslims all media , however , published the government spokesman 's denial that the fugitive had been apprehended . " the news that mladic was arrested is not true , " srdjan djuric said .
he said the report was " manipulation that harms , as well as hinders the serbian government 's efforts to bring the cooperation with the hague tribunal to a close . " previously , the independent serbian b92 radio quoted several unofficial sources that mladic had been captured in belgrade before being transferred to an air base at the northern bosnian town of tuzla .
the station on wednesday still stood by its report despite all the denials . a former senior secret police official told afp late on tuesday that an operation to locate and catch mladic was still underway , but " so far without any result . " pressure to capture mladic mounts from international community the 62-year-old former bosnian serb military chief is wanted for some of the worst atrocities committed during the 1992-95 war in bosnia .
mladic was indicted in 1995 over the three-and-a-half year siege of sarajevo and the july 1995 srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and boys .

china has also indicated a harder line on iran . the question of copyright infringement is one of the west 's biggest concerns about investing in china . so when german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday won a pledge from his chinese counterpart to work harder at stemming the problem , the group of executives accompanying him must have breathed a sigh of relief . " the continuation of our economic relations must take place in a reliable environment , " steinmeier said at a news conference in peking during his first state trip to china . copyright concerns have grown in the past week following the announcement by a chinese company that it will build a magnetic levitation train to compete with the one siemens runs in shanghai . though no one accused the chinese of stealing the technology from siemens , european companies have often encountered outright theft when it comes to their technology patents . china issues strong iran statement li zhaoxing 's promise will be part of the discussion in a new bilateral commission created to encourage " strategic dialogue " between the two countries announced on wednesday . also part of the future dialogue would be china 's human rights situation , which steinmeier only briefly touched on , and china 's immense dependency on raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier and li zhaoxing steinmeier was unable to get as much commitment on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
should all diplomatic avenues shut down , the us and eu-3 support referring the matter of iran 's nuclear program to the un security council where they would seek economic sanctions against the islamic republic .
a russian and chinese veto stand in the way . earlier this week , a chinese foreign ministry spokesman issued the country 's strongest statement yet on iran - urging teheran to once again suspend uranium-enriching activities it had taken up in january , defying the international community . on wednesday , li appealed for a diplomatic solution but said that china would not rush in deciding how to best deal with iran .
he said they would wait until the report by the international atomic energy association at the beginning of march . merkel will visit in may " we have to use this time , " he said .
steinmeier , in japan on tuesday , did not rule out the possibility of sanctions . the repeal of the eu weapon 's embargo on china - a favorite demand by steinmeier 's former boss , chancellor gerhard schröder - is not supported by merkel 's government .
but china said it will continue to press germany for its support .

" the board considers that it -lrb- the offer -rrb- does not adequately reflect the true value of endesa , " the company said , while still welcoming the fact " the operation proposed by e.on maintains the integrity of endesa 's industrial project , without offloading shares . " the bid came after the spanish government had on feb .
3 given its blessing to a rival bid from spanish utility gas natural , which was 29 percent lower than e.on 's at 22.5-billion euros . gas natural responded to e.on 's entrance into the fray by saying it was continuing with its bid . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero threw the bid into further doubt when he said he wanted to retain national ownership of spain 's energy providers .
zapatero late tuesday held lengthy talks with e.on chairman wulf bernotat to discuss the takeover offer for his country 's leading electricity group and insisted he wanted to see spanish energy utilities remain in spanish hands , according to spanish government sources . el mundo newspaper 's web site said zapatero had told bernotat he was " worried " about the bid . responding to zapatero 's concerns about maintaining key sectors in spanish hands , gas natural said it wanted to create a company " with the capacity to compete at european and world level and with the capacity to maintain its centre of decision-making in spain . " combined energy giant would service 50 million clients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's takeover would create a world leader e.on 's all-cash offer , which would create the world 's leading power and gas supplier , risks upsetting zapatero 's plans to create a national champion in the spanish energy sector which could compete internationally in a consolidated market . the germans have offered 27.50 euros -lrb- $ 32.75 -rrb- per share compared with gas natural 's 21.30 euros per share , but the latter insisted tuesday that its own bid was in the interests of the electricity company 's shareholders and spain in general . the combination of e.on and endesa would create a group with 50 million customers and 107,000 employees , putting it ahead of companies such as electricite de france -lrb- edf -rrb- , tokyo electric , rwe , enel and suez , the german group said . the e.on takeover bid , announced tuesday in germany , had appeared to take madrid by surprise and analysts saw the cash bid as a blow to madrid 's support for " strong energy enterprises " at global level . a finance ministry spokesman earlier had told reporters it was " not very likely " the government would intervene , despite having a " golden share " in endesa through june 2007 that would enable it to block e.on. the spokesman said madrid was " totally neutral " on the german offer . the european union has ruled such state holdings illegal , and the ministry spokesman pointed out that madrid was debating the passage of legislation to bring spanish law in to line to meet the eu stricture . any obstruction could anger eu over liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy commissioner andris piebalgs wants more liberalization if the spanish government were to intervene and obstruct the bid it could spark a europe-wide political row .
some analysts believe the eu would accuse madrid of standing in the way of consolidation in europe 's energy markets . the european commission has been pushing for market liberalization reforms in the energy sector and has reportedly been getting increasingly impatient due to what it views as a widespread lack of progress in the implementation of reforms by member states . energy commissioner andris piebalgs said last week that the eu executive will issue warnings against three member states over slow implementation by the end of march without naming names , although unconfirmed reports suggest e.on and fellow german utility rwe ag as well as france 's edf , and italy 's enel spa have been accused of blocking competitors from operating on fair terms in their home markets . in its reaction , endesa 's board said " the price offered by e.on is clearly better than the rival gas natural bid but the board considers that it -lrb- the offer -rrb- does not adequately reflect the true value of endesa , " endesa said . madrid wants strong spanish enterprises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's government would respect the energy sector 's rules spanish secretary of state for communication fernando moraleda said madrid wanted to see the creation of " strong enterprises with spanish capital on board and with a capacity to compete on international markets . " asked about future government policy regarding endesa , moraleda added that madrid respected the rules of the market . senior ruling socialist party official alfredo perez rubalcaba said madrid would apply " the same criteria " to the case as it had earlier with gas natural , saying that what counted was " the general interest , the interests of consumers and the strategic character of the sector . " however , the main conservative opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which said it had detected regional politicking in the original deal since the government has allies in the catalan region that is home to gas natural , accused the government of being " the only ones responsible " for the german counter-bid . there had been contradictory signs in spain concerning the gas natural bid .
the market regulator approved the deal but with conditions while the competition regulator was opposed . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany not affected by russian gas dispute even though russia is the largest supplier of natural gas to germany , consumers here have no reason to worry that their supplies will suffer as a consequence of the russian-ukrainian dispute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bird flu : the continuing threat germany 's media tangle with bird flu bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion the westward migration of bird flu bird flu : the facts europe -pipe- 22.02.2006 europe diverges on how to stop spread of bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and the netherlands want to go ahead with bird vaccinations past brushes and the devastation wreaked in asia have taught europe the dangers that bird flu brings with it .
but there are differing notions in the eu on how best to stop its march . given europe 's difficulty on agreeing on most things , it should probably come as no surprise that eu members have different ideas on how best to stop the spread of bird flu . on wednesday , france and the netherlands received permission from the eu to begin vaccinating their bird populations against the avian virus h5n1 .
the strategy is highly controversial among experts and had previously been rejected by the eu as an appropriate way to stop the spread of the virus in domesticated bird populations . " our current methods of vaccination only mask the disease , " german agriculture minister horst seehofer told reporters outside of a meeting of eu agricultural ministers this week . critics argue that the vaccine does n't prevent the poultry from catching the virus , though the vaccine does enable the virus to spread undetected through bird populations because the symptoms are reduced . sparing the poultry industry but french and dutch officials remain resolute .
holland 's poultry industry was devastated by an outbreak of a similar virus in 2003 .
after starting in belgium , the virus forced poultry farmers to cull 30 million birds in order to avoid further contamination . " each decision is a weighing of the advantages and the disadvantages , " said johan bongers , a veterinarian at the central institute for animal disease control in lelystad , the netherlands .
" we know what it is to have avian influenza , we know how difficult it is to eradicate it .
that 's why we are in favor of vaccination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preventative measures are being undertaken in germany bongers admits that the vaccines are not optimal .
but he says improvements are being worked on at the moment .
vaccines have been used effectively in southeast asia - where h5n1 has been wreaking havoc since 2003 - but only as an additional measure to culling . european union regulations at the moment continue to favor culling . once a domesticated bird has been infected , health officials are required to set up a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- buffer zone around the affected farm .
owners of that farm , as well as any other farm with potential for infection are required to kill their poultry stocks . farmers in germany on the northern island of rügen , where the first infected swan was discovered , have already killed 2,500 birds as a precautionary measure . bad times ahead for kliewe 's farm " that is a hard measure maybe , but there should be no hesitation , " said cees vermeeren , of the brussels-based european poultry lobbying organization avec , which does n't recommend vaccination .
" if you hesitate at the beginning , then you have lost the battle . " but culling also means massive economic losses for poultry farmers , something france - ­ the world 's fourth-largest poultry producer - ­ is eager to avoid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culling could cost the poultry industry tens of millions of euros poultry farmers in northern germany are already feeling the impact .
on sunday , holger kliewe was forced to kill 2,000 of the geese , ducks and chickens he breeds to sell to the tourists who come to his farm and hotel . " i can understand these measures because we have regular visitors , products that we sell from our farm , and we have a restaurant , " said kliewe . but , he added , " our means of production have been taken away completely . "
for a farmer like kliewe , that means a loss of 70 percent of his income .
the other 30 percent , tourism , is taking a hit as well . no alarm , yet " all of us on rügen are suffering from a tarnished image , " kliewe said , adding that guests have already called to cancel their easter vacation reservations .
" the anti-flu measures will convince no one to come to the island in the near future .
that 's why we need this crisis to be contained as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen is worried about a tarnished image eu officials remain confident exactly that will happen .
for all the sensational headlines european editorialists have indulged in since the discovery of infected swans -lrb- germany 's bild tabloid splashed " the fear is growing " across its front page on tuesday -rrb- , the virus has yet to make the dangerous jump from wild fowl to domesticated birds . " it will be a problem when the first domesticated poultry are infected , " said uwe truyen , managing director of the institute of animal hygiene and veterinary health at the university of leipzig .
" at the moment , we can still observe cautiously , but calmly . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear borders on hysteria as bird flu hits europe while european governments are n't hitting the panic button as yet , the spread of bird flu has definitely got a lot of people fearing that the end is nigh .

he said the structure of the german education system fosters inequalities . the investigation was prompted by allegations that school students with immigrant and low-income backgrounds are hugely disadvantaged in primary schools in germany and that they have little chance to obtain academic qualifications . munoz said that it was difficult for outsiders to see through the german school system .
since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .
" but here as anywhere else poor people tend to care less about education .
in germany , however , this tendency is further aggravated by the fact that individual selection of specific schools starts very early in life . " oecd study highlights problems munoz pointed to an oecd study in the year 2000 that in his view showed a correlation between the german school system and poor results of its pupils .
in the study , german 15-year-olds were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will their backgrounds decide their academic future ?
the study also highlighted major inequalities in the school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers .
munoz said that compared with other countries strikingly few of these children would be able reach academic qualifications . also , stringent school selection procedures , starting at as young an age as eight or nine , foster school careers based on the will of parents rather than pupils ' merits , he said . " i would recommend a careful rethinking of the federal structures in the german school system , " he said .
" they are inhomogeneous and lead to inequalities .
the same applies to the school selection process .

he said the structure of the german education system fosters inequalities . the investigation was prompted by allegations that school students with immigrant and low-income backgrounds are hugely disadvantaged in primary schools in germany and that they have little chance to obtain academic qualifications . munoz said that it was difficult for outsiders to see through the german school system .
since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .
" but here as anywhere else poor people tend to care less about education .
in germany , however , this tendency is further aggravated by the fact that individual selection of specific schools starts very early in life .

a german parliamentary commission is meeting wednesday behind closed doors to examine the role of the country 's secret service in the iraq war . opposition parties in the parliamentary control commission reviewing the role of the german intelligence service in iraq are dissatisfied with the government 's report on the issue .
members of the green and left parties said the official response to their questions was inadequate .
the german government handed over its report to the control commission earlier this week .
the commission is discussing the report behind closed doors on wednesday . the body 's green party representative , christian ströbele , said prior to the meeting he would seek a minority vote on the report . " the report does not meet my approval , " ströbele told the newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" we have to clarify if something is still open . " the report looks at the role of the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- in iraq , the cia 's abduction of german citizen khaled el-masri and secret cia flights in europe , as well as prisoner interrogations abroad by german investigators . commission seeks maximum transparency the commission will decide whether to call for a formal parliamentary probe after they 've discussed the report . but the commission 's left party representative , wolfgang neskovic , said a parliamentary inquiry to clarify the bnd affair was necessary .
he told german radio rbb-inforadio that the commission did not have " the necessary clarification instruments " that an inquiry would .
the commission could only draw on that information relinquished by the government , neskovic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission needs to clarify what the bnd did in iraq the federal government and the commission will jointly decide how much of the report will be made public .
but the opposition would like as much transparency as possible .
should the government 's information not satisfy the commission , a formal parliamentary probe is still an option . berlin failed to provide a clear answer on masri german prosecutors said they were investigating whether the government knew - sooner than it admitted - that the cia had wrongfully detained el-masri . " we are investigating this , " said christian schmidt-sommerfeld , chief state prosecutor in the southern city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri said undercover us agents mistakenly detained him the german government has for months faced allegations that it may have joined forces with the cia in the case of 42-year-old masri , who was held in afghanistan for five months as a suspected terrorist .
but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied a cover-up , saying late last year that berlin only learnt of the episode after the cia released masri in may 2004 . schmidt-sommerfeld said the government has been asked to clarify the matter .
although it has responded , it has so far failed to provide a clear answer , he said . masri has meanwhile claimed that one of the men who interrogated him while he was in afghanistan was a high-ranking member of the german police .
schmidt-sommerfeld said masri identified the policeman from photographs .
but when they met face to face earlier this week in new ulm - the southern german town where the former detainee lives - he could not be " absolutely sure " that it was the man who questioned him . " we need absolute certainty , " the prosecutor said .
he said his office would also try to establish whether the policeman was in afghanistan at the time . masri , an unemployed car salesman , claims he was drugged , questioned and tortured in a prison camp in afghanistan and later released without explanation in albania .
he has filed a lawsuit against the cia , demanding at least $ 75,000 dollars in damages . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us intelligence allegedly bugged german agents in iraq a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 .

a german parliamentary commission is meeting wednesday behind closed doors to examine the role of the country 's secret service in the iraq war . opposition parties in the parliamentary control commission reviewing the role of the german intelligence service in iraq are dissatisfied with the government 's report on the issue .
members of the green and left parties said the official response to their questions was inadequate .
the german government handed over its report to the control commission earlier this week .
the commission is discussing the report behind closed doors on wednesday . the body 's green party representative , christian ströbele , said prior to the meeting he would seek a minority vote on the report . " the report does not meet my approval , " ströbele told the newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" we have to clarify if something is still open . " the report looks at the role of the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- in iraq , the cia 's abduction of german citizen khaled el-masri and secret cia flights in europe , as well as prisoner interrogations abroad by german investigators . commission seeks maximum transparency the commission will decide whether to call for a formal parliamentary probe after they 've discussed the report . but the commission 's left party representative , wolfgang neskovic , said a parliamentary inquiry to clarify the bnd affair was necessary .
he told german radio rbb-inforadio that the commission did not have " the necessary clarification instruments " that an inquiry would .
the commission could only draw on that information relinquished by the government , neskovic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission needs to clarify what the bnd did in iraq the federal government and the commission will jointly decide how much of the report will be made public .
but the opposition would like as much transparency as possible .
should the government 's information not satisfy the commission , a formal parliamentary probe is still an option . berlin failed to provide a clear answer on masri german prosecutors said they were investigating whether the government knew - sooner than it admitted - that the cia had wrongfully detained el-masri . " we are investigating this , " said christian schmidt-sommerfeld , chief state prosecutor in the southern city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri said undercover us agents mistakenly detained him the german government has for months faced allegations that it may have joined forces with the cia in the case of 42-year-old masri , who was held in afghanistan for five months as a suspected terrorist .
but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied a cover-up , saying late last year that berlin only learnt of the episode after the cia released masri in may 2004 . schmidt-sommerfeld said the government has been asked to clarify the matter .
although it has responded , it has so far failed to provide a clear answer , he said . masri has meanwhile claimed that one of the men who interrogated him while he was in afghanistan was a high-ranking member of the german police .
schmidt-sommerfeld said masri identified the policeman from photographs .
but when they met face to face earlier this week in new ulm - the southern german town where the former detainee lives - he could not be " absolutely sure " that it was the man who questioned him . " we need absolute certainty , " the prosecutor said .
he said his office would also try to establish whether the policeman was in afghanistan at the time . masri , an unemployed car salesman , claims he was drugged , questioned and tortured in a prison camp in afghanistan and later released without explanation in albania .
he has filed a lawsuit against the cia , demanding at least $ 75,000 dollars in damages . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us intelligence allegedly bugged german agents in iraq a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 .

" no one would be crazy enough to go into a stadium anyway , " he concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bird flu has already hit germany 's northern baltic island of rügen franz-josef holzenkamp , an agriculture policy expert with the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , also jumped on the bandwagon .
" if the virus becomes that dangerous , our priority must be people , not the world cup . " the debate started after the green party 's agriculture expert , bärbel höhn , and the leader of the world health organization 's flu program , klaus stöhr , both spoke of emergency measures regarding mass public gatherings in the event of a pandemic . " absurd " suggestion only fuels panic , says sports head # b # however , peter danckert , the chairman of the sports committee in the bundestag , called the idea " preposterous " and " absurd , " adding that spreading such paranoid speculation was " very unhelpful . " höhn later said that her statements were made in the context of a potential mutation in the h5n1 virus into a communicable variation between humans and that she was referring to all major events in the instance of such an outbreak .
she did not , at the present time , refer directly to the world cup in the current climate . who expert stöhr also qualified his previous statement , saying that he was referring to steps that would be taken in the event of a human bird flu pandemic .
in the case of the virus becoming a human-to-human infection " it would take a very , very brave person not to call off an event like the world cup , " he said . despite these moves to diffuse the row , danckert said that the best way to have avoided adding to the hysteria would have been to not have made the statements in the first place . the world cup organizing committee has not commented on the statements . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear borders on hysteria as bird flu hits europe while european governments are n't hitting the panic button as yet , the spread of bird flu has definitely got a lot of people fearing that the end is nigh .

china has also indicated a harder line on iran . the question of copyright infringement is one of the west 's biggest concerns about investing in china . so when german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday won a pledge from his chinese counterpart to work harder at stemming the problem , the group of executives accompanying him must have breathed a sigh of relief . " the continuation of our economic relations must take place in a reliable environment , " steinmeier said at a news conference in peking during his first state trip to china . copyright concerns have grown in the past week following the announcement by a chinese company that it will build a magnetic levitation train to compete with the one siemens runs in shanghai . though no one accused the chinese of stealing the technology from siemens , european companies have often encountered outright theft when it comes to their technology patents . china issues strong iran statement li zhaoxing 's promise will be part of the discussion in a new bilateral commission created to encourage " strategic dialogue " between the two countries announced on wednesday . also part of the future dialogue would be china 's human rights situation , which steinmeier only briefly touched on , and china 's immense dependency on raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier and li zhaoxing steinmeier was unable to get as much commitment on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
should all diplomatic avenues shut down , the us and eu-3 support referring the matter of iran 's nuclear program to the un security council where they would seek economic sanctions against the islamic republic .
a russian and chinese veto stand in the way . earlier this week , a chinese foreign ministry spokesman issued the country 's strongest statement yet on iran - urging teheran to once again suspend uranium-enriching activities it had taken up in january , defying the international community . on wednesday , li appealed for a diplomatic solution but said that china would not rush in deciding how to best deal with iran .
he said they would wait until the report by the international atomic energy association at the beginning of march . merkel will visit in may " we have to use this time , " he said .
steinmeier , in japan on tuesday , did not rule out the possibility of sanctions . the repeal of the eu weapon 's embargo on china - a favorite demand by steinmeier 's former boss , chancellor gerhard schröder - is not supported by merkel 's government .
but china said it will continue to press germany for its support .

zapatero late tuesday held lengthy talks with e.on chairman wulf bernotat to discuss the takeover offer for his country 's leading electricity group and insisted he wanted to see spanish energy utilities remain in spanish hands , according to spanish government sources . el mundo newspaper 's web site said zapatero had told bernotat he was " worried " about the bid . responding to zapatero 's concerns about maintaining key sectors in spanish hands , gas natural said it wanted to create a company " with the capacity to compete at european and world level and with the capacity to maintain its centre of decision-making in spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.02.2006 expert says human rights in china making no progress großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arbitary executions , even for petty crime , are rampant in china german foreign minister steinmeier is visiting china and is under pressure to address the precarious human rights situation there .
beate wagner from the human rights forum told dw-world what the critical issues are . beate wagner is a member of the human rights forum 's coordination group and secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
the human rights forum is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . dw-world : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is visiting beijing .
the question of human rights will also be taken up , as is always the case when a high-ranking german politician travels to china .
in what form should steinmeier address the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beate wagner says more has to be done to step pressure on china to improve human rights beate wagner : human rights should be an integral part of german foreign policy .
the issue should be dealt with on various levels .
on the one hand , it could be addressed publicly during a press conference with the president .
but there should also be pressure on the level of existing dialogue that the topic is taken seriously .
there is the human rights dialogue - which has existed between the european union and china for years - and the dialogue on the bilateral level between germany and china .
there have to be questions about progress , in order for a true dialogue to develop .
this is apparently not the case at present . to what extent ?
where are the shortcomings ? the human rights situation in china is well known .
the number of people executed in china equals the amount executed in all other countries of the world put together .
you can even be executed there for tax crimes .
there is no freedom of the press or freedom of expression .
the human rights situation has not improved . in view of these facts , dialogue does n't appear to have really helped .
does n't there need to be more pressure ? these forms of dialogue should only be continued when they bring results after a certain period of time .
the bilateral dialogue has to be settled .
it has to be clearly stated what sort of progress has to be achieved .
otherwise , there is no justification to continue it .
it just glosses over a situation in china which is very bad for human rights . former chancellor gerhard schröder was very reserved when it came to criticizing the human rights situation in china and russia .
his former director of the chancellery steinmeier is now foreign minister .
will he set other priorities ? i ca n't judge that yet .
the human rights forum has positively noted that the new government with chancellor merkel 's statements has placed a different emphasis when it comes to russia and the united states .
we 'll have to see how that translates into concrete policies . honestly , though , are human rights really even a priority in china ?
are n't economic interests given greater significance ? of course , that 's something we fear .
and you have to continuously demand that human rights are an integral part of german foreign policy .
that is also part of various demands by the human rights forum .
we are not satisfied with the level which human rights have in german foreign policy .
we continue to see significant deficits , also concerning china . steffen leidel interviewed beate wagner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday .
-lrb- feb .
22 , 2006 -rrb- choosing markets over morals chancellor schröder 's trips to china , turkey and russia mostly involve banging the drum for big business .

beate wagner from the human rights forum told dw-world what the critical issues are . beate wagner is a member of the human rights forum 's coordination group and secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
the human rights forum is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . dw-world : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is visiting beijing .
the question of human rights will also be taken up , as is always the case when a high-ranking german politician travels to china .
in what form should steinmeier address the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beate wagner says more has to be done to step pressure on china to improve human rights beate wagner : human rights should be an integral part of german foreign policy .
the issue should be dealt with on various levels .
on the one hand , it could be addressed publicly during a press conference with the president .
but there should also be pressure on the level of existing dialogue that the topic is taken seriously .
there is the human rights dialogue - which has existed between the european union and china for years - and the dialogue on the bilateral level between germany and china .
there have to be questions about progress , in order for a true dialogue to develop .
this is apparently not the case at present . to what extent ?
where are the shortcomings ? the human rights situation in china is well known .
the number of people executed in china equals the amount executed in all other countries of the world put together .
you can even be executed there for tax crimes .
there is no freedom of the press or freedom of expression .
the human rights situation has not improved . in view of these facts , dialogue does n't appear to have really helped .
does n't there need to be more pressure ? these forms of dialogue should only be continued when they bring results after a certain period of time .
the bilateral dialogue has to be settled .
it has to be clearly stated what sort of progress has to be achieved .
otherwise , there is no justification to continue it .
it just glosses over a situation in china which is very bad for human rights . former chancellor gerhard schröder was very reserved when it came to criticizing the human rights situation in china and russia .
his former director of the chancellery steinmeier is now foreign minister .
will he set other priorities ? i ca n't judge that yet .
the human rights forum has positively noted that the new government with chancellor merkel 's statements has placed a different emphasis when it comes to russia and the united states .
we 'll have to see how that translates into concrete policies . honestly , though , are human rights really even a priority in china ?
are n't economic interests given greater significance ? of course , that 's something we fear .
and you have to continuously demand that human rights are an integral part of german foreign policy .
that is also part of various demands by the human rights forum .
we are not satisfied with the level which human rights have in german foreign policy .
we continue to see significant deficits , also concerning china . steffen leidel interviewed beate wagner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday .

the strategy is highly controversial among experts and had previously been rejected by the eu as an appropriate way to stop the spread of the virus in domesticated bird populations . " our current methods of vaccination only mask the disease , " german agriculture minister horst seehofer told reporters outside of a meeting of eu agricultural ministers this week . critics argue that the vaccine does n't prevent the poultry from catching the virus , though the vaccine does enable the virus to spread undetected through bird populations because the symptoms are reduced . sparing the poultry industry but french and dutch officials remain resolute .
holland 's poultry industry was devastated by an outbreak of a similar virus in 2003 .
after starting in belgium , the virus forced poultry farmers to cull 30 million birds in order to avoid further contamination .

" i can understand these measures because we have regular visitors , products that we sell from our farm , and we have a restaurant , " said kliewe . but , he added , " our means of production have been taken away completely .

for a farmer like kliewe , that means a loss of 70 percent of his income .
the other 30 percent , tourism , is taking a hit as well . no alarm , yet " all of us on rügen are suffering from a tarnished image , " kliewe said , adding that guests have already called to cancel their easter vacation reservations .

but the government denied his arrest . conflicting reports dominated newspapers in the serbian capital on wednesday that the former bosnian serb general ratko mladic had been located , arrested and was even already on his way to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague . but the serbian government and police denied he was arrested , as did the tribunal 's chief prosecutor , carla del ponte . " mladic arrested , " read the only headline on the front page of nationalist daily glas javnosti with the general 's picture across the page . " ratko mladic and his bodyguard were arrested in a belgrade apartment , where negotiations on his voluntary surrender had been previously held , " the daily said , quoting a source close to serbian authorities . but the largest-circulation daily vecernje novosti only said that the noose had tightened on the fugitive , as " all political preparations for the arrest are completed and mladic is given only a little bit more time to decide to surrender . "
otherwise , he would be arrested by special police forces , the paper said . the influential pro-government politika daily cited anonymous sources as saying " the operation of capturing mladic started around 3:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0230 gmt -rrb- on tuesday in new belgrade , near a luxurious hotel . "
but it did not report on the end of the operation . reports of mladic 's arrest are " manipulation " some serbian and bosnian serb media reported that mladic had been located at cer mountain , some 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- west of belgrade .
negotiations were now underway on his surrender , they said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic allegedly ordered the murder of thousands of muslims all media , however , published the government spokesman 's denial that the fugitive had been apprehended . " the news that mladic was arrested is not true , " srdjan djuric said .
he said the report was " manipulation that harms , as well as hinders the serbian government 's efforts to bring the cooperation with the hague tribunal to a close . " previously , the independent serbian b92 radio quoted several unofficial sources that mladic had been captured in belgrade before being transferred to an air base at the northern bosnian town of tuzla .
the station on wednesday still stood by its report despite all the denials . a former senior secret police official told afp late on tuesday that an operation to locate and catch mladic was still underway , but " so far without any result . " pressure to capture mladic mounts from international community the 62-year-old former bosnian serb military chief is wanted for some of the worst atrocities committed during the 1992-95 war in bosnia .
mladic was indicted in 1995 over the three-and-a-half year siege of sarajevo and the july 1995 srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and boys .
it is considered the single worst atrocity in europe since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands were executed in srebrenica besides mladic , the only remaining war crimes suspects from the yugoslav wars in the mid-1990s are his wartime political leader , radovan karadzic , and four other ethnic serbs . reports of his impending capture follow mounting pressure from the international community for serbia to bring him before the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague . the serbian government has been giving strong signals that the net is closing on mladic after being clearly told by top international officials that talks on its closer ties with the european union would be frozen if belgrade failed to deliver him by the end of february . mladic had lived almost openly in belgrade until the october 2000 ouster of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
he then hid throughout the country under military protection until 2002 , according to a recent admission of the authorities . del ponte has said that he was still in hiding on serbian soil with the help of the military .

" no one would be crazy enough to go into a stadium anyway , " he concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bird flu has already hit germany 's northern baltic island of rügen franz-josef holzenkamp , an agriculture policy expert with the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , also jumped on the bandwagon .
" if the virus becomes that dangerous , our priority must be people , not the world cup . " the debate started after the green party 's agriculture expert , bärbel höhn , and the leader of the world health organization 's flu program , klaus stöhr , both spoke of emergency measures regarding mass public gatherings in the event of a pandemic . " absurd " suggestion only fuels panic , says sports head # b # however , peter danckert , the chairman of the sports committee in the bundestag , called the idea " preposterous " and " absurd , " adding that spreading such paranoid speculation was " very unhelpful . " höhn later said that her statements were made in the context of a potential mutation in the h5n1 virus into a communicable variation between humans and that she was referring to all major events in the instance of such an outbreak .
she did not , at the present time , refer directly to the world cup in the current climate . who expert stöhr also qualified his previous statement , saying that he was referring to steps that would be taken in the event of a human bird flu pandemic .
in the case of the virus becoming a human-to-human infection " it would take a very , very brave person not to call off an event like the world cup , " he said . despite these moves to diffuse the row , danckert said that the best way to have avoided adding to the hysteria would have been to not have made the statements in the first place . the world cup organizing committee has not commented on the statements . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear borders on hysteria as bird flu hits europe while european governments are n't hitting the panic button as yet , the spread of bird flu has definitely got a lot of people fearing that the end is nigh .

a german parliamentary commission is meeting wednesday behind closed doors to examine the role of the country 's secret service in the iraq war . opposition parties in the parliamentary control commission reviewing the role of the german intelligence service in iraq are dissatisfied with the government 's report on the issue .
members of the green and left parties said the official response to their questions was inadequate .
the german government handed over its report to the control commission earlier this week .
the commission is discussing the report behind closed doors on wednesday . the body 's green party representative , christian ströbele , said prior to the meeting he would seek a minority vote on the report . " the report does not meet my approval , " ströbele told the newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" we have to clarify if something is still open . " the report looks at the role of the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- in iraq , the cia 's abduction of german citizen khaled el-masri and secret cia flights in europe , as well as prisoner interrogations abroad by german investigators . commission seeks maximum transparency the commission will decide whether to call for a formal parliamentary probe after they 've discussed the report . but the commission 's left party representative , wolfgang neskovic , said a parliamentary inquiry to clarify the bnd affair was necessary .
he told german radio rbb-inforadio that the commission did not have " the necessary clarification instruments " that an inquiry would .
the commission could only draw on that information relinquished by the government , neskovic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission needs to clarify what the bnd did in iraq the federal government and the commission will jointly decide how much of the report will be made public .
but the opposition would like as much transparency as possible .
should the government 's information not satisfy the commission , a formal parliamentary probe is still an option . berlin failed to provide a clear answer on masri german prosecutors said they were investigating whether the government knew - sooner than it admitted - that the cia had wrongfully detained el-masri . " we are investigating this , " said christian schmidt-sommerfeld , chief state prosecutor in the southern city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri said undercover us agents mistakenly detained him the german government has for months faced allegations that it may have joined forces with the cia in the case of 42-year-old masri , who was held in afghanistan for five months as a suspected terrorist .
but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied a cover-up , saying late last year that berlin only learnt of the episode after the cia released masri in may 2004 . schmidt-sommerfeld said the government has been asked to clarify the matter .
although it has responded , it has so far failed to provide a clear answer , he said . masri has meanwhile claimed that one of the men who interrogated him while he was in afghanistan was a high-ranking member of the german police .
schmidt-sommerfeld said masri identified the policeman from photographs .
but when they met face to face earlier this week in new ulm - the southern german town where the former detainee lives - he could not be " absolutely sure " that it was the man who questioned him . " we need absolute certainty , " the prosecutor said .
he said his office would also try to establish whether the policeman was in afghanistan at the time . masri , an unemployed car salesman , claims he was drugged , questioned and tortured in a prison camp in afghanistan and later released without explanation in albania .
he has filed a lawsuit against the cia , demanding at least $ 75,000 dollars in damages . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us intelligence allegedly bugged german agents in iraq a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 .

a german parliamentary commission is meeting wednesday behind closed doors to examine the role of the country 's secret service in the iraq war . opposition parties in the parliamentary control commission reviewing the role of the german intelligence service in iraq are dissatisfied with the government 's report on the issue .
members of the green and left parties said the official response to their questions was inadequate .
the german government handed over its report to the control commission earlier this week .
the commission is discussing the report behind closed doors on wednesday . the body 's green party representative , christian ströbele , said prior to the meeting he would seek a minority vote on the report . " the report does not meet my approval , " ströbele told the newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" we have to clarify if something is still open . " the report looks at the role of the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- in iraq , the cia 's abduction of german citizen khaled el-masri and secret cia flights in europe , as well as prisoner interrogations abroad by german investigators . commission seeks maximum transparency the commission will decide whether to call for a formal parliamentary probe after they 've discussed the report . but the commission 's left party representative , wolfgang neskovic , said a parliamentary inquiry to clarify the bnd affair was necessary .
he told german radio rbb-inforadio that the commission did not have " the necessary clarification instruments " that an inquiry would .
the commission could only draw on that information relinquished by the government , neskovic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission needs to clarify what the bnd did in iraq the federal government and the commission will jointly decide how much of the report will be made public .
but the opposition would like as much transparency as possible .
should the government 's information not satisfy the commission , a formal parliamentary probe is still an option . berlin failed to provide a clear answer on masri german prosecutors said they were investigating whether the government knew - sooner than it admitted - that the cia had wrongfully detained el-masri . " we are investigating this , " said christian schmidt-sommerfeld , chief state prosecutor in the southern city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri said undercover us agents mistakenly detained him the german government has for months faced allegations that it may have joined forces with the cia in the case of 42-year-old masri , who was held in afghanistan for five months as a suspected terrorist .
but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied a cover-up , saying late last year that berlin only learnt of the episode after the cia released masri in may 2004 . schmidt-sommerfeld said the government has been asked to clarify the matter .
although it has responded , it has so far failed to provide a clear answer , he said . masri has meanwhile claimed that one of the men who interrogated him while he was in afghanistan was a high-ranking member of the german police .
schmidt-sommerfeld said masri identified the policeman from photographs .
but when they met face to face earlier this week in new ulm - the southern german town where the former detainee lives - he could not be " absolutely sure " that it was the man who questioned him . " we need absolute certainty , " the prosecutor said .
he said his office would also try to establish whether the policeman was in afghanistan at the time . masri , an unemployed car salesman , claims he was drugged , questioned and tortured in a prison camp in afghanistan and later released without explanation in albania .
he has filed a lawsuit against the cia , demanding at least $ 75,000 dollars in damages . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us intelligence allegedly bugged german agents in iraq a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 .

china has also indicated a harder line on iran . the question of copyright infringement is one of the west 's biggest concerns about investing in china . so when german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday won a pledge from his chinese counterpart to work harder at stemming the problem , the group of executives accompanying him must have breathed a sigh of relief . " the continuation of our economic relations must take place in a reliable environment , " steinmeier said at a news conference in peking during his first state trip to china . copyright concerns have grown in the past week following the announcement by a chinese company that it will build a magnetic levitation train to compete with the one siemens runs in shanghai . though no one accused the chinese of stealing the technology from siemens , european companies have often encountered outright theft when it comes to their technology patents . china issues strong iran statement li zhaoxing 's promise will be part of the discussion in a new bilateral commission created to encourage " strategic dialogue " between the two countries announced on wednesday . also part of the future dialogue would be china 's human rights situation , which steinmeier only briefly touched on , and china 's immense dependency on raw materials .

a russian and chinese veto stand in the way . earlier this week , a chinese foreign ministry spokesman issued the country 's strongest statement yet on iran - urging teheran to once again suspend uranium-enriching activities it had taken up in january , defying the international community . on wednesday , li appealed for a diplomatic solution but said that china would not rush in deciding how to best deal with iran .
he said they would wait until the report by the international atomic energy association at the beginning of march . merkel will visit in may " we have to use this time , " he said .
steinmeier , in japan on tuesday , did not rule out the possibility of sanctions . the repeal of the eu weapon 's embargo on china - a favorite demand by steinmeier 's former boss , chancellor gerhard schröder - is not supported by merkel 's government .
but china said it will continue to press germany for its support .

germany launches world cup charm offensive germans gloomy about the future current affairs -pipe- 22.02.2006 germany ends nationwide pep talk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was everyone this excited ?
germany 's national pep talk campaign " du bist deutschland " has come to an end .
to its creators , it was an unparalleled success .
to comedians , a bottomless well of material . after thousands of minutes of air time , as many pages of newsprint , and - likely - as many people who took delight in trashing its message , germany 's five-month nationwide pep talk campaign has come to an end . the privately-sponsored 30-million-euro -lrb- $ 25-million -rrb- campaign , " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- reached 58 percent of the population , according to a sample poll commissioned by the creators .
forty percent of those polled said they appreciated the television and print spots in which sports , literary , tv and film personalities urged germans to take a personal stake in lifting the country ' spirits . but have they ? journalists and late-night show hosts , who took delight in slamming the feel-good vibe of the campaign , certainly have n't .
a campaign spokesman said it had been caricatured at least 300 times .
the labor union ig metall even printed postcards using the slogan to criticize changes in the labor market .
it was mocked for being everything from " kindergarten-like " to nazi-like , and got little support from the very industry responsible for its incarnation . mission accomplished creators jung von matt appear unperturbed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : du bist deutschland placard featuring albert einstein " we reached our goal , " wrote oliver voss , the creative head of the german pr agency in last sunday 's welt am sonntag .
" we wanted nothing else than that germany talks with itself and about itself . " but are germans more motivated about solving the country 's problems - from bad attitudes to unemployment - than before ?
the answer was nowhere to be found in the analysis by consumer-research group gfk - and likely never will be determined by any study . the creators do n't seem to mind .
after all , all publicity is good publicity .
and with close to 40 million people happy with its message , bertelsmann manager gunter thielen - the campaign 's originator - thinks it 's worth a second run . but thielen said he would n't continue to lead it .
" it 's time for others to push it forward , " he said . given the study results , it should n't be that difficult to find someone . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi photo trips up confidence campaign the " du bist deutschland " media campaign was intended to inspire germans to feel positive about their country .
a photo showing nazis using a similar slogan in the 1930 's has caused more than a few red faces .

24 , 2005 -rrb- do n't worry , be happy … or you 're fired !
some say germany is a nation of complainers .
one company in leipzig got tired of all the bellyaching and instituted a " no grumbling " policy .
experts say a little less whining could be good for the country .

but now leading german media organizations have launched a new initiative to help lift their spirits .

china has also indicated a harder line on iran . the question of copyright infringement is one of the west 's biggest concerns about investing in china . so when german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday won a pledge from his chinese counterpart to work harder at stemming the problem , the group of executives accompanying him must have breathed a sigh of relief . " the continuation of our economic relations must take place in a reliable environment , " steinmeier said at a news conference in peking during his first state trip to china . copyright concerns have grown in the past week following the announcement by a chinese company that it will build a magnetic levitation train to compete with the one siemens runs in shanghai . though no one accused the chinese of stealing the technology from siemens , european companies have often encountered outright theft when it comes to their technology patents . china issues strong iran statement li zhaoxing 's promise will be part of the discussion in a new bilateral commission created to encourage " strategic dialogue " between the two countries announced on wednesday . also part of the future dialogue would be china 's human rights situation , which steinmeier only briefly touched on , and china 's immense dependency on raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier and li zhaoxing steinmeier was unable to get as much commitment on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
should all diplomatic avenues shut down , the us and eu-3 support referring the matter of iran 's nuclear program to the un security council where they would seek economic sanctions against the islamic republic .
a russian and chinese veto stand in the way . earlier this week , a chinese foreign ministry spokesman issued the country 's strongest statement yet on iran - urging teheran to once again suspend uranium-enriching activities it had taken up in january , defying the international community . on wednesday , li appealed for a diplomatic solution but said that china would not rush in deciding how to best deal with iran .
he said they would wait until the report by the international atomic energy association at the beginning of march . merkel will visit in may " we have to use this time , " he said .
steinmeier , in japan on tuesday , did not rule out the possibility of sanctions . the repeal of the eu weapon 's embargo on china - a favorite demand by steinmeier 's former boss , chancellor gerhard schröder - is not supported by merkel 's government .
but china said it will continue to press germany for its support .

since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .

china has also indicated a harder line on iran . the question of copyright infringement is one of the west 's biggest concerns about investing in china . so when german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday won a pledge from his chinese counterpart to work harder at stemming the problem , the group of executives accompanying him must have breathed a sigh of relief . " the continuation of our economic relations must take place in a reliable environment , " steinmeier said at a news conference in peking during his first state trip to china . copyright concerns have grown in the past week following the announcement by a chinese company that it will build a magnetic levitation train to compete with the one siemens runs in shanghai . though no one accused the chinese of stealing the technology from siemens , european companies have often encountered outright theft when it comes to their technology patents . china issues strong iran statement li zhaoxing 's promise will be part of the discussion in a new bilateral commission created to encourage " strategic dialogue " between the two countries announced on wednesday . also part of the future dialogue would be china 's human rights situation , which steinmeier only briefly touched on , and china 's immense dependency on raw materials .

a russian and chinese veto stand in the way . earlier this week , a chinese foreign ministry spokesman issued the country 's strongest statement yet on iran - urging teheran to once again suspend uranium-enriching activities it had taken up in january , defying the international community . on wednesday , li appealed for a diplomatic solution but said that china would not rush in deciding how to best deal with iran .
he said they would wait until the report by the international atomic energy association at the beginning of march . merkel will visit in may " we have to use this time , " he said .
steinmeier , in japan on tuesday , did not rule out the possibility of sanctions . the repeal of the eu weapon 's embargo on china - a favorite demand by steinmeier 's former boss , chancellor gerhard schröder - is not supported by merkel 's government .

beate wagner from the human rights forum told dw-world what the critical issues are . beate wagner is a member of the human rights forum 's coordination group and secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
the human rights forum is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . dw-world : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is visiting beijing .
the question of human rights will also be taken up , as is always the case when a high-ranking german politician travels to china .
in what form should steinmeier address the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beate wagner says more has to be done to step pressure on china to improve human rights beate wagner : human rights should be an integral part of german foreign policy .
the issue should be dealt with on various levels .
on the one hand , it could be addressed publicly during a press conference with the president .
but there should also be pressure on the level of existing dialogue that the topic is taken seriously .
there is the human rights dialogue - which has existed between the european union and china for years - and the dialogue on the bilateral level between germany and china .
there have to be questions about progress , in order for a true dialogue to develop .
this is apparently not the case at present . to what extent ?
where are the shortcomings ? the human rights situation in china is well known .
the number of people executed in china equals the amount executed in all other countries of the world put together .
you can even be executed there for tax crimes .
there is no freedom of the press or freedom of expression .
the human rights situation has not improved . in view of these facts , dialogue does n't appear to have really helped .
does n't there need to be more pressure ? these forms of dialogue should only be continued when they bring results after a certain period of time .
the bilateral dialogue has to be settled .
it has to be clearly stated what sort of progress has to be achieved .
otherwise , there is no justification to continue it .
it just glosses over a situation in china which is very bad for human rights . former chancellor gerhard schröder was very reserved when it came to criticizing the human rights situation in china and russia .
his former director of the chancellery steinmeier is now foreign minister .
will he set other priorities ? i ca n't judge that yet .
the human rights forum has positively noted that the new government with chancellor merkel 's statements has placed a different emphasis when it comes to russia and the united states .
we 'll have to see how that translates into concrete policies . honestly , though , are human rights really even a priority in china ?
are n't economic interests given greater significance ? of course , that 's something we fear .
and you have to continuously demand that human rights are an integral part of german foreign policy .
that is also part of various demands by the human rights forum .
we are not satisfied with the level which human rights have in german foreign policy .
we continue to see significant deficits , also concerning china . steffen leidel interviewed beate wagner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday .

22 , 2006 -rrb- choosing markets over morals chancellor schröder 's trips to china , turkey and russia mostly involve banging the drum for big business .

beate wagner from the human rights forum told dw-world what the critical issues are . beate wagner is a member of the human rights forum 's coordination group and secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
the human rights forum is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . dw-world : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is visiting beijing .
the question of human rights will also be taken up , as is always the case when a high-ranking german politician travels to china .
in what form should steinmeier address the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beate wagner says more has to be done to step pressure on china to improve human rights beate wagner : human rights should be an integral part of german foreign policy .
the issue should be dealt with on various levels .
on the one hand , it could be addressed publicly during a press conference with the president .
but there should also be pressure on the level of existing dialogue that the topic is taken seriously .
there is the human rights dialogue - which has existed between the european union and china for years - and the dialogue on the bilateral level between germany and china .
there have to be questions about progress , in order for a true dialogue to develop .
this is apparently not the case at present . to what extent ?
where are the shortcomings ? the human rights situation in china is well known .
the number of people executed in china equals the amount executed in all other countries of the world put together .
you can even be executed there for tax crimes .
there is no freedom of the press or freedom of expression .
the human rights situation has not improved . in view of these facts , dialogue does n't appear to have really helped .
does n't there need to be more pressure ? these forms of dialogue should only be continued when they bring results after a certain period of time .
the bilateral dialogue has to be settled .
it has to be clearly stated what sort of progress has to be achieved .
otherwise , there is no justification to continue it .
it just glosses over a situation in china which is very bad for human rights . former chancellor gerhard schröder was very reserved when it came to criticizing the human rights situation in china and russia .
his former director of the chancellery steinmeier is now foreign minister .
will he set other priorities ? i ca n't judge that yet .
the human rights forum has positively noted that the new government with chancellor merkel 's statements has placed a different emphasis when it comes to russia and the united states .
we 'll have to see how that translates into concrete policies . honestly , though , are human rights really even a priority in china ?
are n't economic interests given greater significance ? of course , that 's something we fear .
and you have to continuously demand that human rights are an integral part of german foreign policy .
that is also part of various demands by the human rights forum .
we are not satisfied with the level which human rights have in german foreign policy .

but the government denied his arrest . conflicting reports dominated newspapers in the serbian capital on wednesday that the former bosnian serb general ratko mladic had been located , arrested and was even already on his way to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague . but the serbian government and police denied he was arrested , as did the tribunal 's chief prosecutor , carla del ponte . " mladic arrested , " read the only headline on the front page of nationalist daily glas javnosti with the general 's picture across the page . " ratko mladic and his bodyguard were arrested in a belgrade apartment , where negotiations on his voluntary surrender had been previously held , " the daily said , quoting a source close to serbian authorities . but the largest-circulation daily vecernje novosti only said that the noose had tightened on the fugitive , as " all political preparations for the arrest are completed and mladic is given only a little bit more time to decide to surrender . "
otherwise , he would be arrested by special police forces , the paper said . the influential pro-government politika daily cited anonymous sources as saying " the operation of capturing mladic started around 3:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0230 gmt -rrb- on tuesday in new belgrade , near a luxurious hotel . "
but it did not report on the end of the operation . reports of mladic 's arrest are " manipulation " some serbian and bosnian serb media reported that mladic had been located at cer mountain , some 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- west of belgrade .
negotiations were now underway on his surrender , they said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic allegedly ordered the murder of thousands of muslims all media , however , published the government spokesman 's denial that the fugitive had been apprehended . " the news that mladic was arrested is not true , " srdjan djuric said .
he said the report was " manipulation that harms , as well as hinders the serbian government 's efforts to bring the cooperation with the hague tribunal to a close . " previously , the independent serbian b92 radio quoted several unofficial sources that mladic had been captured in belgrade before being transferred to an air base at the northern bosnian town of tuzla .
the station on wednesday still stood by its report despite all the denials . a former senior secret police official told afp late on tuesday that an operation to locate and catch mladic was still underway , but " so far without any result . " pressure to capture mladic mounts from international community the 62-year-old former bosnian serb military chief is wanted for some of the worst atrocities committed during the 1992-95 war in bosnia .
mladic was indicted in 1995 over the three-and-a-half year siege of sarajevo and the july 1995 srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and boys .
it is considered the single worst atrocity in europe since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands were executed in srebrenica besides mladic , the only remaining war crimes suspects from the yugoslav wars in the mid-1990s are his wartime political leader , radovan karadzic , and four other ethnic serbs . reports of his impending capture follow mounting pressure from the international community for serbia to bring him before the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague . the serbian government has been giving strong signals that the net is closing on mladic after being clearly told by top international officials that talks on its closer ties with the european union would be frozen if belgrade failed to deliver him by the end of february . mladic had lived almost openly in belgrade until the october 2000 ouster of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
he then hid throughout the country under military protection until 2002 , according to a recent admission of the authorities . del ponte has said that he was still in hiding on serbian soil with the help of the military .
belgrade authorities have persistently denied any knowledge of his whereabouts . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war crimes suspect arrested in canaries croatian general ante gotovina , a fugitive accused of war crimes in the former yugoslavia , has been arrested at a luxury hotel in the canary islands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bird flu : the continuing threat germany 's media tangle with bird flu bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion the westward migration of bird flu bird flu : the facts europe -pipe- 22.02.2006 europe diverges on how to stop spread of bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and the netherlands want to go ahead with bird vaccinations past brushes and the devastation wreaked in asia have taught europe the dangers that bird flu brings with it .
but there are differing notions in the eu on how best to stop its march . given europe 's difficulty on agreeing on most things , it should probably come as no surprise that eu members have different ideas on how best to stop the spread of bird flu . on wednesday , france and the netherlands received permission from the eu to begin vaccinating their bird populations against the avian virus h5n1 .
the strategy is highly controversial among experts and had previously been rejected by the eu as an appropriate way to stop the spread of the virus in domesticated bird populations . " our current methods of vaccination only mask the disease , " german agriculture minister horst seehofer told reporters outside of a meeting of eu agricultural ministers this week . critics argue that the vaccine does n't prevent the poultry from catching the virus , though the vaccine does enable the virus to spread undetected through bird populations because the symptoms are reduced . sparing the poultry industry but french and dutch officials remain resolute .
holland 's poultry industry was devastated by an outbreak of a similar virus in 2003 .
after starting in belgium , the virus forced poultry farmers to cull 30 million birds in order to avoid further contamination . " each decision is a weighing of the advantages and the disadvantages , " said johan bongers , a veterinarian at the central institute for animal disease control in lelystad , the netherlands .
" we know what it is to have avian influenza , we know how difficult it is to eradicate it .
that 's why we are in favor of vaccination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preventative measures are being undertaken in germany bongers admits that the vaccines are not optimal .
but he says improvements are being worked on at the moment .
vaccines have been used effectively in southeast asia - where h5n1 has been wreaking havoc since 2003 - but only as an additional measure to culling . european union regulations at the moment continue to favor culling . once a domesticated bird has been infected , health officials are required to set up a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- buffer zone around the affected farm .
owners of that farm , as well as any other farm with potential for infection are required to kill their poultry stocks . farmers in germany on the northern island of rügen , where the first infected swan was discovered , have already killed 2,500 birds as a precautionary measure . bad times ahead for kliewe 's farm " that is a hard measure maybe , but there should be no hesitation , " said cees vermeeren , of the brussels-based european poultry lobbying organization avec , which does n't recommend vaccination .
" if you hesitate at the beginning , then you have lost the battle . " but culling also means massive economic losses for poultry farmers , something france - ­ the world 's fourth-largest poultry producer - ­ is eager to avoid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culling could cost the poultry industry tens of millions of euros poultry farmers in northern germany are already feeling the impact .
on sunday , holger kliewe was forced to kill 2,000 of the geese , ducks and chickens he breeds to sell to the tourists who come to his farm and hotel . " i can understand these measures because we have regular visitors , products that we sell from our farm , and we have a restaurant , " said kliewe . but , he added , " our means of production have been taken away completely . "
for a farmer like kliewe , that means a loss of 70 percent of his income .
the other 30 percent , tourism , is taking a hit as well . no alarm , yet " all of us on rügen are suffering from a tarnished image , " kliewe said , adding that guests have already called to cancel their easter vacation reservations .
" the anti-flu measures will convince no one to come to the island in the near future .
that 's why we need this crisis to be contained as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen is worried about a tarnished image eu officials remain confident exactly that will happen .
for all the sensational headlines european editorialists have indulged in since the discovery of infected swans -lrb- germany 's bild tabloid splashed " the fear is growing " across its front page on tuesday -rrb- , the virus has yet to make the dangerous jump from wild fowl to domesticated birds . " it will be a problem when the first domesticated poultry are infected , " said uwe truyen , managing director of the institute of animal hygiene and veterinary health at the university of leipzig .
" at the moment , we can still observe cautiously , but calmly . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear borders on hysteria as bird flu hits europe while european governments are n't hitting the panic button as yet , the spread of bird flu has definitely got a lot of people fearing that the end is nigh .

but there are differing notions in the eu on how best to stop its march . given europe 's difficulty on agreeing on most things , it should probably come as no surprise that eu members have different ideas on how best to stop the spread of bird flu . on wednesday , france and the netherlands received permission from the eu to begin vaccinating their bird populations against the avian virus h5n1 .
the strategy is highly controversial among experts and had previously been rejected by the eu as an appropriate way to stop the spread of the virus in domesticated bird populations . " our current methods of vaccination only mask the disease , " german agriculture minister horst seehofer told reporters outside of a meeting of eu agricultural ministers this week . critics argue that the vaccine does n't prevent the poultry from catching the virus , though the vaccine does enable the virus to spread undetected through bird populations because the symptoms are reduced . sparing the poultry industry but french and dutch officials remain resolute .
holland 's poultry industry was devastated by an outbreak of a similar virus in 2003 .
after starting in belgium , the virus forced poultry farmers to cull 30 million birds in order to avoid further contamination .

but he says improvements are being worked on at the moment .
vaccines have been used effectively in southeast asia - where h5n1 has been wreaking havoc since 2003 - but only as an additional measure to culling . european union regulations at the moment continue to favor culling . once a domesticated bird has been infected , health officials are required to set up a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- buffer zone around the affected farm .
owners of that farm , as well as any other farm with potential for infection are required to kill their poultry stocks . farmers in germany on the northern island of rügen , where the first infected swan was discovered , have already killed 2,500 birds as a precautionary measure . bad times ahead for kliewe 's farm " that is a hard measure maybe , but there should be no hesitation , " said cees vermeeren , of the brussels-based european poultry lobbying organization avec , which does n't recommend vaccination .
" if you hesitate at the beginning , then you have lost the battle . " but culling also means massive economic losses for poultry farmers , something france - ­ the world 's fourth-largest poultry producer - ­ is eager to avoid .

on sunday , holger kliewe was forced to kill 2,000 of the geese , ducks and chickens he breeds to sell to the tourists who come to his farm and hotel . " i can understand these measures because we have regular visitors , products that we sell from our farm , and we have a restaurant , " said kliewe . but , he added , " our means of production have been taken away completely . "
for a farmer like kliewe , that means a loss of 70 percent of his income .
the other 30 percent , tourism , is taking a hit as well . no alarm , yet " all of us on rügen are suffering from a tarnished image , " kliewe said , adding that guests have already called to cancel their easter vacation reservations .

he said the structure of the german education system fosters inequalities . the investigation was prompted by allegations that school students with immigrant and low-income backgrounds are hugely disadvantaged in primary schools in germany and that they have little chance to obtain academic qualifications . munoz said that it was difficult for outsiders to see through the german school system .
since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .
" but here as anywhere else poor people tend to care less about education .
in germany , however , this tendency is further aggravated by the fact that individual selection of specific schools starts very early in life . " oecd study highlights problems munoz pointed to an oecd study in the year 2000 that in his view showed a correlation between the german school system and poor results of its pupils .
in the study , german 15-year-olds were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will their backgrounds decide their academic future ?
the study also highlighted major inequalities in the school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers .
munoz said that compared with other countries strikingly few of these children would be able reach academic qualifications . also , stringent school selection procedures , starting at as young an age as eight or nine , foster school careers based on the will of parents rather than pupils ' merits , he said . " i would recommend a careful rethinking of the federal structures in the german school system , " he said .
" they are inhomogeneous and lead to inequalities .
the same applies to the school selection process .
at such an early stage it is unable to use the full potentials of pupils to their best . " reforms already under way germany 's education minister , anette schavan , underlined that major reforms to the system were already underway in all federal states .
they would resolve some of the problems touched on by munoz , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will school uniforms serve as equalizers ?
" our education system will change so that all pupils can decide on their school careers at every age , " schavan said .
" this will overcome the differences and inequalities that still exist today . " german parents organizations welcomed munoz 's visit and said that hints from outside were needed at this stage .
the parents also said that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un probes german school inequality the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .

he said the structure of the german education system fosters inequalities . the investigation was prompted by allegations that school students with immigrant and low-income backgrounds are hugely disadvantaged in primary schools in germany and that they have little chance to obtain academic qualifications . munoz said that it was difficult for outsiders to see through the german school system .
since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .

china has also indicated a harder line on iran . the question of copyright infringement is one of the west 's biggest concerns about investing in china . so when german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday won a pledge from his chinese counterpart to work harder at stemming the problem , the group of executives accompanying him must have breathed a sigh of relief . " the continuation of our economic relations must take place in a reliable environment , " steinmeier said at a news conference in peking during his first state trip to china . copyright concerns have grown in the past week following the announcement by a chinese company that it will build a magnetic levitation train to compete with the one siemens runs in shanghai . though no one accused the chinese of stealing the technology from siemens , european companies have often encountered outright theft when it comes to their technology patents . china issues strong iran statement li zhaoxing 's promise will be part of the discussion in a new bilateral commission created to encourage " strategic dialogue " between the two countries announced on wednesday . also part of the future dialogue would be china 's human rights situation , which steinmeier only briefly touched on , and china 's immense dependency on raw materials .

a russian and chinese veto stand in the way . earlier this week , a chinese foreign ministry spokesman issued the country 's strongest statement yet on iran - urging teheran to once again suspend uranium-enriching activities it had taken up in january , defying the international community . on wednesday , li appealed for a diplomatic solution but said that china would not rush in deciding how to best deal with iran .
he said they would wait until the report by the international atomic energy association at the beginning of march . merkel will visit in may " we have to use this time , " he said .
steinmeier , in japan on tuesday , did not rule out the possibility of sanctions . the repeal of the eu weapon 's embargo on china - a favorite demand by steinmeier 's former boss , chancellor gerhard schröder - is not supported by merkel 's government .
but china said it will continue to press germany for its support .

" the continuation of our economic relations must take place in a reliable environment , " steinmeier said at a news conference in peking during his first state trip to china . copyright concerns have grown in the past week following the announcement by a chinese company that it will build a magnetic levitation train to compete with the one siemens runs in shanghai . though no one accused the chinese of stealing the technology from siemens , european companies have often encountered outright theft when it comes to their technology patents . china issues strong iran statement li zhaoxing 's promise will be part of the discussion in a new bilateral commission created to encourage " strategic dialogue " between the two countries announced on wednesday . also part of the future dialogue would be china 's human rights situation , which steinmeier only briefly touched on , and china 's immense dependency on raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier and li zhaoxing steinmeier was unable to get as much commitment on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
should all diplomatic avenues shut down , the us and eu-3 support referring the matter of iran 's nuclear program to the un security council where they would seek economic sanctions against the islamic republic .
a russian and chinese veto stand in the way . earlier this week , a chinese foreign ministry spokesman issued the country 's strongest statement yet on iran - urging teheran to once again suspend uranium-enriching activities it had taken up in january , defying the international community . on wednesday , li appealed for a diplomatic solution but said that china would not rush in deciding how to best deal with iran .
he said they would wait until the report by the international atomic energy association at the beginning of march . merkel will visit in may " we have to use this time , " he said .
steinmeier , in japan on tuesday , did not rule out the possibility of sanctions . the repeal of the eu weapon 's embargo on china - a favorite demand by steinmeier 's former boss , chancellor gerhard schröder - is not supported by merkel 's government .
but china said it will continue to press germany for its support .

he said the structure of the german education system fosters inequalities . the investigation was prompted by allegations that school students with immigrant and low-income backgrounds are hugely disadvantaged in primary schools in germany and that they have little chance to obtain academic qualifications . munoz said that it was difficult for outsiders to see through the german school system .
since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .
" but here as anywhere else poor people tend to care less about education .
in germany , however , this tendency is further aggravated by the fact that individual selection of specific schools starts very early in life . " oecd study highlights problems munoz pointed to an oecd study in the year 2000 that in his view showed a correlation between the german school system and poor results of its pupils .
in the study , german 15-year-olds were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will their backgrounds decide their academic future ?
the study also highlighted major inequalities in the school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers .
munoz said that compared with other countries strikingly few of these children would be able reach academic qualifications . also , stringent school selection procedures , starting at as young an age as eight or nine , foster school careers based on the will of parents rather than pupils ' merits , he said . " i would recommend a careful rethinking of the federal structures in the german school system , " he said .
" they are inhomogeneous and lead to inequalities .
the same applies to the school selection process .
at such an early stage it is unable to use the full potentials of pupils to their best . " reforms already under way germany 's education minister , anette schavan , underlined that major reforms to the system were already underway in all federal states .
they would resolve some of the problems touched on by munoz , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will school uniforms serve as equalizers ?
" our education system will change so that all pupils can decide on their school careers at every age , " schavan said .
" this will overcome the differences and inequalities that still exist today . " german parents organizations welcomed munoz 's visit and said that hints from outside were needed at this stage .
the parents also said that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un probes german school inequality the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .

the answer was nowhere to be found in the analysis by consumer-research group gfk - and likely never will be determined by any study . the creators do n't seem to mind .
after all , all publicity is good publicity .
and with close to 40 million people happy with its message , bertelsmann manager gunter thielen - the campaign 's originator - thinks it 's worth a second run . but thielen said he would n't continue to lead it .

a german parliamentary commission is meeting wednesday behind closed doors to examine the role of the country 's secret service in the iraq war . opposition parties in the parliamentary control commission reviewing the role of the german intelligence service in iraq are dissatisfied with the government 's report on the issue .
members of the green and left parties said the official response to their questions was inadequate .
the german government handed over its report to the control commission earlier this week .
the commission is discussing the report behind closed doors on wednesday . the body 's green party representative , christian ströbele , said prior to the meeting he would seek a minority vote on the report . " the report does not meet my approval , " ströbele told the newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" we have to clarify if something is still open . " the report looks at the role of the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- in iraq , the cia 's abduction of german citizen khaled el-masri and secret cia flights in europe , as well as prisoner interrogations abroad by german investigators . commission seeks maximum transparency the commission will decide whether to call for a formal parliamentary probe after they 've discussed the report . but the commission 's left party representative , wolfgang neskovic , said a parliamentary inquiry to clarify the bnd affair was necessary .
he told german radio rbb-inforadio that the commission did not have " the necessary clarification instruments " that an inquiry would .
the commission could only draw on that information relinquished by the government , neskovic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission needs to clarify what the bnd did in iraq the federal government and the commission will jointly decide how much of the report will be made public .
but the opposition would like as much transparency as possible .
should the government 's information not satisfy the commission , a formal parliamentary probe is still an option . berlin failed to provide a clear answer on masri german prosecutors said they were investigating whether the government knew - sooner than it admitted - that the cia had wrongfully detained el-masri . " we are investigating this , " said christian schmidt-sommerfeld , chief state prosecutor in the southern city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri said undercover us agents mistakenly detained him the german government has for months faced allegations that it may have joined forces with the cia in the case of 42-year-old masri , who was held in afghanistan for five months as a suspected terrorist .
but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied a cover-up , saying late last year that berlin only learnt of the episode after the cia released masri in may 2004 . schmidt-sommerfeld said the government has been asked to clarify the matter .
although it has responded , it has so far failed to provide a clear answer , he said . masri has meanwhile claimed that one of the men who interrogated him while he was in afghanistan was a high-ranking member of the german police .
schmidt-sommerfeld said masri identified the policeman from photographs .
but when they met face to face earlier this week in new ulm - the southern german town where the former detainee lives - he could not be " absolutely sure " that it was the man who questioned him . " we need absolute certainty , " the prosecutor said .
he said his office would also try to establish whether the policeman was in afghanistan at the time . masri , an unemployed car salesman , claims he was drugged , questioned and tortured in a prison camp in afghanistan and later released without explanation in albania .
he has filed a lawsuit against the cia , demanding at least $ 75,000 dollars in damages . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us intelligence allegedly bugged german agents in iraq a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 .

a german parliamentary commission is meeting wednesday behind closed doors to examine the role of the country 's secret service in the iraq war . opposition parties in the parliamentary control commission reviewing the role of the german intelligence service in iraq are dissatisfied with the government 's report on the issue .
members of the green and left parties said the official response to their questions was inadequate .
the german government handed over its report to the control commission earlier this week .
the commission is discussing the report behind closed doors on wednesday . the body 's green party representative , christian ströbele , said prior to the meeting he would seek a minority vote on the report . " the report does not meet my approval , " ströbele told the newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" we have to clarify if something is still open . " the report looks at the role of the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- in iraq , the cia 's abduction of german citizen khaled el-masri and secret cia flights in europe , as well as prisoner interrogations abroad by german investigators . commission seeks maximum transparency the commission will decide whether to call for a formal parliamentary probe after they 've discussed the report . but the commission 's left party representative , wolfgang neskovic , said a parliamentary inquiry to clarify the bnd affair was necessary .
he told german radio rbb-inforadio that the commission did not have " the necessary clarification instruments " that an inquiry would .
the commission could only draw on that information relinquished by the government , neskovic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission needs to clarify what the bnd did in iraq the federal government and the commission will jointly decide how much of the report will be made public .
but the opposition would like as much transparency as possible .
should the government 's information not satisfy the commission , a formal parliamentary probe is still an option . berlin failed to provide a clear answer on masri german prosecutors said they were investigating whether the government knew - sooner than it admitted - that the cia had wrongfully detained el-masri . " we are investigating this , " said christian schmidt-sommerfeld , chief state prosecutor in the southern city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri said undercover us agents mistakenly detained him the german government has for months faced allegations that it may have joined forces with the cia in the case of 42-year-old masri , who was held in afghanistan for five months as a suspected terrorist .
but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied a cover-up , saying late last year that berlin only learnt of the episode after the cia released masri in may 2004 . schmidt-sommerfeld said the government has been asked to clarify the matter .
although it has responded , it has so far failed to provide a clear answer , he said . masri has meanwhile claimed that one of the men who interrogated him while he was in afghanistan was a high-ranking member of the german police .
schmidt-sommerfeld said masri identified the policeman from photographs .
but when they met face to face earlier this week in new ulm - the southern german town where the former detainee lives - he could not be " absolutely sure " that it was the man who questioned him . " we need absolute certainty , " the prosecutor said .
he said his office would also try to establish whether the policeman was in afghanistan at the time . masri , an unemployed car salesman , claims he was drugged , questioned and tortured in a prison camp in afghanistan and later released without explanation in albania .
he has filed a lawsuit against the cia , demanding at least $ 75,000 dollars in damages . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us intelligence allegedly bugged german agents in iraq a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 .

a german parliamentary commission is meeting wednesday behind closed doors to examine the role of the country 's secret service in the iraq war . opposition parties in the parliamentary control commission reviewing the role of the german intelligence service in iraq are dissatisfied with the government 's report on the issue .
members of the green and left parties said the official response to their questions was inadequate .
the german government handed over its report to the control commission earlier this week .
the commission is discussing the report behind closed doors on wednesday . the body 's green party representative , christian ströbele , said prior to the meeting he would seek a minority vote on the report . " the report does not meet my approval , " ströbele told the newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" we have to clarify if something is still open . " the report looks at the role of the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- in iraq , the cia 's abduction of german citizen khaled el-masri and secret cia flights in europe , as well as prisoner interrogations abroad by german investigators . commission seeks maximum transparency the commission will decide whether to call for a formal parliamentary probe after they 've discussed the report . but the commission 's left party representative , wolfgang neskovic , said a parliamentary inquiry to clarify the bnd affair was necessary .
he told german radio rbb-inforadio that the commission did not have " the necessary clarification instruments " that an inquiry would .
the commission could only draw on that information relinquished by the government , neskovic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission needs to clarify what the bnd did in iraq the federal government and the commission will jointly decide how much of the report will be made public .
but the opposition would like as much transparency as possible .
should the government 's information not satisfy the commission , a formal parliamentary probe is still an option . berlin failed to provide a clear answer on masri german prosecutors said they were investigating whether the government knew - sooner than it admitted - that the cia had wrongfully detained el-masri . " we are investigating this , " said christian schmidt-sommerfeld , chief state prosecutor in the southern city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri said undercover us agents mistakenly detained him the german government has for months faced allegations that it may have joined forces with the cia in the case of 42-year-old masri , who was held in afghanistan for five months as a suspected terrorist .
but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied a cover-up , saying late last year that berlin only learnt of the episode after the cia released masri in may 2004 . schmidt-sommerfeld said the government has been asked to clarify the matter .
although it has responded , it has so far failed to provide a clear answer , he said . masri has meanwhile claimed that one of the men who interrogated him while he was in afghanistan was a high-ranking member of the german police .
schmidt-sommerfeld said masri identified the policeman from photographs .
but when they met face to face earlier this week in new ulm - the southern german town where the former detainee lives - he could not be " absolutely sure " that it was the man who questioned him . " we need absolute certainty , " the prosecutor said .
he said his office would also try to establish whether the policeman was in afghanistan at the time . masri , an unemployed car salesman , claims he was drugged , questioned and tortured in a prison camp in afghanistan and later released without explanation in albania .
he has filed a lawsuit against the cia , demanding at least $ 75,000 dollars in damages . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us intelligence allegedly bugged german agents in iraq a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 .

she did not , at the present time , refer directly to the world cup in the current climate . who expert stöhr also qualified his previous statement , saying that he was referring to steps that would be taken in the event of a human bird flu pandemic .
in the case of the virus becoming a human-to-human infection " it would take a very , very brave person not to call off an event like the world cup , " he said . despite these moves to diffuse the row , danckert said that the best way to have avoided adding to the hysteria would have been to not have made the statements in the first place . the world cup organizing committee has not commented on the statements . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear borders on hysteria as bird flu hits europe while european governments are n't hitting the panic button as yet , the spread of bird flu has definitely got a lot of people fearing that the end is nigh .

zapatero late tuesday held lengthy talks with e.on chairman wulf bernotat to discuss the takeover offer for his country 's leading electricity group and insisted he wanted to see spanish energy utilities remain in spanish hands , according to spanish government sources . el mundo newspaper 's web site said zapatero had told bernotat he was " worried " about the bid . responding to zapatero 's concerns about maintaining key sectors in spanish hands , gas natural said it wanted to create a company " with the capacity to compete at european and world level and with the capacity to maintain its centre of decision-making in spain .

" the board considers that it -lrb- the offer -rrb- does not adequately reflect the true value of endesa , " the company said , while still welcoming the fact " the operation proposed by e.on maintains the integrity of endesa 's industrial project , without offloading shares . " the bid came after the spanish government had on feb .
3 given its blessing to a rival bid from spanish utility gas natural , which was 29 percent lower than e.on 's at 22.5-billion euros . gas natural responded to e.on 's entrance into the fray by saying it was continuing with its bid . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero threw the bid into further doubt when he said he wanted to retain national ownership of spain 's energy providers .
zapatero late tuesday held lengthy talks with e.on chairman wulf bernotat to discuss the takeover offer for his country 's leading electricity group and insisted he wanted to see spanish energy utilities remain in spanish hands , according to spanish government sources . el mundo newspaper 's web site said zapatero had told bernotat he was " worried " about the bid . responding to zapatero 's concerns about maintaining key sectors in spanish hands , gas natural said it wanted to create a company " with the capacity to compete at european and world level and with the capacity to maintain its centre of decision-making in spain . " combined energy giant would service 50 million clients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's takeover would create a world leader e.on 's all-cash offer , which would create the world 's leading power and gas supplier , risks upsetting zapatero 's plans to create a national champion in the spanish energy sector which could compete internationally in a consolidated market . the germans have offered 27.50 euros -lrb- $ 32.75 -rrb- per share compared with gas natural 's 21.30 euros per share , but the latter insisted tuesday that its own bid was in the interests of the electricity company 's shareholders and spain in general . the combination of e.on and endesa would create a group with 50 million customers and 107,000 employees , putting it ahead of companies such as electricite de france -lrb- edf -rrb- , tokyo electric , rwe , enel and suez , the german group said . the e.on takeover bid , announced tuesday in germany , had appeared to take madrid by surprise and analysts saw the cash bid as a blow to madrid 's support for " strong energy enterprises " at global level . a finance ministry spokesman earlier had told reporters it was " not very likely " the government would intervene , despite having a " golden share " in endesa through june 2007 that would enable it to block e.on. the spokesman said madrid was " totally neutral " on the german offer . the european union has ruled such state holdings illegal , and the ministry spokesman pointed out that madrid was debating the passage of legislation to bring spanish law in to line to meet the eu stricture . any obstruction could anger eu over liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy commissioner andris piebalgs wants more liberalization if the spanish government were to intervene and obstruct the bid it could spark a europe-wide political row .
some analysts believe the eu would accuse madrid of standing in the way of consolidation in europe 's energy markets . the european commission has been pushing for market liberalization reforms in the energy sector and has reportedly been getting increasingly impatient due to what it views as a widespread lack of progress in the implementation of reforms by member states . energy commissioner andris piebalgs said last week that the eu executive will issue warnings against three member states over slow implementation by the end of march without naming names , although unconfirmed reports suggest e.on and fellow german utility rwe ag as well as france 's edf , and italy 's enel spa have been accused of blocking competitors from operating on fair terms in their home markets . in its reaction , endesa 's board said " the price offered by e.on is clearly better than the rival gas natural bid but the board considers that it -lrb- the offer -rrb- does not adequately reflect the true value of endesa , " endesa said . madrid wants strong spanish enterprises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's government would respect the energy sector 's rules spanish secretary of state for communication fernando moraleda said madrid wanted to see the creation of " strong enterprises with spanish capital on board and with a capacity to compete on international markets . " asked about future government policy regarding endesa , moraleda added that madrid respected the rules of the market . senior ruling socialist party official alfredo perez rubalcaba said madrid would apply " the same criteria " to the case as it had earlier with gas natural , saying that what counted was " the general interest , the interests of consumers and the strategic character of the sector . " however , the main conservative opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which said it had detected regional politicking in the original deal since the government has allies in the catalan region that is home to gas natural , accused the government of being " the only ones responsible " for the german counter-bid . there had been contradictory signs in spain concerning the gas natural bid .
the market regulator approved the deal but with conditions while the competition regulator was opposed . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany not affected by russian gas dispute even though russia is the largest supplier of natural gas to germany , consumers here have no reason to worry that their supplies will suffer as a consequence of the russian-ukrainian dispute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bird flu : the continuing threat germany 's media tangle with bird flu bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion the westward migration of bird flu bird flu : the facts europe -pipe- 22.02.2006 europe diverges on how to stop spread of bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and the netherlands want to go ahead with bird vaccinations past brushes and the devastation wreaked in asia have taught europe the dangers that bird flu brings with it .
but there are differing notions in the eu on how best to stop its march . given europe 's difficulty on agreeing on most things , it should probably come as no surprise that eu members have different ideas on how best to stop the spread of bird flu . on wednesday , france and the netherlands received permission from the eu to begin vaccinating their bird populations against the avian virus h5n1 .
the strategy is highly controversial among experts and had previously been rejected by the eu as an appropriate way to stop the spread of the virus in domesticated bird populations . " our current methods of vaccination only mask the disease , " german agriculture minister horst seehofer told reporters outside of a meeting of eu agricultural ministers this week . critics argue that the vaccine does n't prevent the poultry from catching the virus , though the vaccine does enable the virus to spread undetected through bird populations because the symptoms are reduced . sparing the poultry industry but french and dutch officials remain resolute .
holland 's poultry industry was devastated by an outbreak of a similar virus in 2003 .
after starting in belgium , the virus forced poultry farmers to cull 30 million birds in order to avoid further contamination . " each decision is a weighing of the advantages and the disadvantages , " said johan bongers , a veterinarian at the central institute for animal disease control in lelystad , the netherlands .
" we know what it is to have avian influenza , we know how difficult it is to eradicate it .
that 's why we are in favor of vaccination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preventative measures are being undertaken in germany bongers admits that the vaccines are not optimal .
but he says improvements are being worked on at the moment .
vaccines have been used effectively in southeast asia - where h5n1 has been wreaking havoc since 2003 - but only as an additional measure to culling . european union regulations at the moment continue to favor culling . once a domesticated bird has been infected , health officials are required to set up a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- buffer zone around the affected farm .
owners of that farm , as well as any other farm with potential for infection are required to kill their poultry stocks . farmers in germany on the northern island of rügen , where the first infected swan was discovered , have already killed 2,500 birds as a precautionary measure . bad times ahead for kliewe 's farm " that is a hard measure maybe , but there should be no hesitation , " said cees vermeeren , of the brussels-based european poultry lobbying organization avec , which does n't recommend vaccination .
" if you hesitate at the beginning , then you have lost the battle . " but culling also means massive economic losses for poultry farmers , something france - ­ the world 's fourth-largest poultry producer - ­ is eager to avoid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culling could cost the poultry industry tens of millions of euros poultry farmers in northern germany are already feeling the impact .
on sunday , holger kliewe was forced to kill 2,000 of the geese , ducks and chickens he breeds to sell to the tourists who come to his farm and hotel . " i can understand these measures because we have regular visitors , products that we sell from our farm , and we have a restaurant , " said kliewe . but , he added , " our means of production have been taken away completely . "
for a farmer like kliewe , that means a loss of 70 percent of his income .
the other 30 percent , tourism , is taking a hit as well . no alarm , yet " all of us on rügen are suffering from a tarnished image , " kliewe said , adding that guests have already called to cancel their easter vacation reservations .
" the anti-flu measures will convince no one to come to the island in the near future .
that 's why we need this crisis to be contained as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen is worried about a tarnished image eu officials remain confident exactly that will happen .
for all the sensational headlines european editorialists have indulged in since the discovery of infected swans -lrb- germany 's bild tabloid splashed " the fear is growing " across its front page on tuesday -rrb- , the virus has yet to make the dangerous jump from wild fowl to domesticated birds . " it will be a problem when the first domesticated poultry are infected , " said uwe truyen , managing director of the institute of animal hygiene and veterinary health at the university of leipzig .
" at the moment , we can still observe cautiously , but calmly . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear borders on hysteria as bird flu hits europe while european governments are n't hitting the panic button as yet , the spread of bird flu has definitely got a lot of people fearing that the end is nigh .

the strategy is highly controversial among experts and had previously been rejected by the eu as an appropriate way to stop the spread of the virus in domesticated bird populations .

but there are differing notions in the eu on how best to stop its march . given europe 's difficulty on agreeing on most things , it should probably come as no surprise that eu members have different ideas on how best to stop the spread of bird flu . on wednesday , france and the netherlands received permission from the eu to begin vaccinating their bird populations against the avian virus h5n1 .
the strategy is highly controversial among experts and had previously been rejected by the eu as an appropriate way to stop the spread of the virus in domesticated bird populations . " our current methods of vaccination only mask the disease , " german agriculture minister horst seehofer told reporters outside of a meeting of eu agricultural ministers this week . critics argue that the vaccine does n't prevent the poultry from catching the virus , though the vaccine does enable the virus to spread undetected through bird populations because the symptoms are reduced . sparing the poultry industry but french and dutch officials remain resolute .
holland 's poultry industry was devastated by an outbreak of a similar virus in 2003 .
after starting in belgium , the virus forced poultry farmers to cull 30 million birds in order to avoid further contamination . " each decision is a weighing of the advantages and the disadvantages , " said johan bongers , a veterinarian at the central institute for animal disease control in lelystad , the netherlands .
" we know what it is to have avian influenza , we know how difficult it is to eradicate it .
that 's why we are in favor of vaccination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preventative measures are being undertaken in germany bongers admits that the vaccines are not optimal .
but he says improvements are being worked on at the moment .
vaccines have been used effectively in southeast asia - where h5n1 has been wreaking havoc since 2003 - but only as an additional measure to culling . european union regulations at the moment continue to favor culling . once a domesticated bird has been infected , health officials are required to set up a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- buffer zone around the affected farm .
owners of that farm , as well as any other farm with potential for infection are required to kill their poultry stocks . farmers in germany on the northern island of rügen , where the first infected swan was discovered , have already killed 2,500 birds as a precautionary measure . bad times ahead for kliewe 's farm " that is a hard measure maybe , but there should be no hesitation , " said cees vermeeren , of the brussels-based european poultry lobbying organization avec , which does n't recommend vaccination .
" if you hesitate at the beginning , then you have lost the battle . " but culling also means massive economic losses for poultry farmers , something france - ­ the world 's fourth-largest poultry producer - ­ is eager to avoid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culling could cost the poultry industry tens of millions of euros poultry farmers in northern germany are already feeling the impact .
on sunday , holger kliewe was forced to kill 2,000 of the geese , ducks and chickens he breeds to sell to the tourists who come to his farm and hotel . " i can understand these measures because we have regular visitors , products that we sell from our farm , and we have a restaurant , " said kliewe . but , he added , " our means of production have been taken away completely . "
for a farmer like kliewe , that means a loss of 70 percent of his income .
the other 30 percent , tourism , is taking a hit as well . no alarm , yet " all of us on rügen are suffering from a tarnished image , " kliewe said , adding that guests have already called to cancel their easter vacation reservations .
" the anti-flu measures will convince no one to come to the island in the near future .
that 's why we need this crisis to be contained as soon as possible . "

since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .

he said the structure of the german education system fosters inequalities . the investigation was prompted by allegations that school students with immigrant and low-income backgrounds are hugely disadvantaged in primary schools in germany and that they have little chance to obtain academic qualifications . munoz said that it was difficult for outsiders to see through the german school system .
since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .
" but here as anywhere else poor people tend to care less about education .
in germany , however , this tendency is further aggravated by the fact that individual selection of specific schools starts very early in life . " oecd study highlights problems munoz pointed to an oecd study in the year 2000 that in his view showed a correlation between the german school system and poor results of its pupils .
in the study , german 15-year-olds were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will their backgrounds decide their academic future ?
the study also highlighted major inequalities in the school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers .
munoz said that compared with other countries strikingly few of these children would be able reach academic qualifications . also , stringent school selection procedures , starting at as young an age as eight or nine , foster school careers based on the will of parents rather than pupils ' merits , he said . " i would recommend a careful rethinking of the federal structures in the german school system , " he said .
" they are inhomogeneous and lead to inequalities .
the same applies to the school selection process .
at such an early stage it is unable to use the full potentials of pupils to their best . " reforms already under way germany 's education minister , anette schavan , underlined that major reforms to the system were already underway in all federal states .
they would resolve some of the problems touched on by munoz , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will school uniforms serve as equalizers ?
" our education system will change so that all pupils can decide on their school careers at every age , " schavan said .
" this will overcome the differences and inequalities that still exist today . " german parents organizations welcomed munoz 's visit and said that hints from outside were needed at this stage .

china has also indicated a harder line on iran . the question of copyright infringement is one of the west 's biggest concerns about investing in china . so when german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday won a pledge from his chinese counterpart to work harder at stemming the problem , the group of executives accompanying him must have breathed a sigh of relief . " the continuation of our economic relations must take place in a reliable environment , " steinmeier said at a news conference in peking during his first state trip to china . copyright concerns have grown in the past week following the announcement by a chinese company that it will build a magnetic levitation train to compete with the one siemens runs in shanghai . though no one accused the chinese of stealing the technology from siemens , european companies have often encountered outright theft when it comes to their technology patents . china issues strong iran statement li zhaoxing 's promise will be part of the discussion in a new bilateral commission created to encourage " strategic dialogue " between the two countries announced on wednesday . also part of the future dialogue would be china 's human rights situation , which steinmeier only briefly touched on , and china 's immense dependency on raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier and li zhaoxing steinmeier was unable to get as much commitment on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
should all diplomatic avenues shut down , the us and eu-3 support referring the matter of iran 's nuclear program to the un security council where they would seek economic sanctions against the islamic republic .
a russian and chinese veto stand in the way . earlier this week , a chinese foreign ministry spokesman issued the country 's strongest statement yet on iran - urging teheran to once again suspend uranium-enriching activities it had taken up in january , defying the international community . on wednesday , li appealed for a diplomatic solution but said that china would not rush in deciding how to best deal with iran .
he said they would wait until the report by the international atomic energy association at the beginning of march . merkel will visit in may " we have to use this time , " he said .
steinmeier , in japan on tuesday , did not rule out the possibility of sanctions . the repeal of the eu weapon 's embargo on china - a favorite demand by steinmeier 's former boss , chancellor gerhard schröder - is not supported by merkel 's government .

beate wagner from the human rights forum told dw-world what the critical issues are . beate wagner is a member of the human rights forum 's coordination group and secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
the human rights forum is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . dw-world : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is visiting beijing .
the question of human rights will also be taken up , as is always the case when a high-ranking german politician travels to china .
in what form should steinmeier address the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beate wagner says more has to be done to step pressure on china to improve human rights beate wagner : human rights should be an integral part of german foreign policy .
the issue should be dealt with on various levels .
on the one hand , it could be addressed publicly during a press conference with the president .
but there should also be pressure on the level of existing dialogue that the topic is taken seriously .
there is the human rights dialogue - which has existed between the european union and china for years - and the dialogue on the bilateral level between germany and china .
there have to be questions about progress , in order for a true dialogue to develop .
this is apparently not the case at present . to what extent ?
where are the shortcomings ? the human rights situation in china is well known .
the number of people executed in china equals the amount executed in all other countries of the world put together .
you can even be executed there for tax crimes .
there is no freedom of the press or freedom of expression .
the human rights situation has not improved . in view of these facts , dialogue does n't appear to have really helped .
does n't there need to be more pressure ? these forms of dialogue should only be continued when they bring results after a certain period of time .
the bilateral dialogue has to be settled .
it has to be clearly stated what sort of progress has to be achieved .
otherwise , there is no justification to continue it .
it just glosses over a situation in china which is very bad for human rights . former chancellor gerhard schröder was very reserved when it came to criticizing the human rights situation in china and russia .
his former director of the chancellery steinmeier is now foreign minister .
will he set other priorities ? i ca n't judge that yet .
the human rights forum has positively noted that the new government with chancellor merkel 's statements has placed a different emphasis when it comes to russia and the united states .
we 'll have to see how that translates into concrete policies . honestly , though , are human rights really even a priority in china ?
are n't economic interests given greater significance ? of course , that 's something we fear .
and you have to continuously demand that human rights are an integral part of german foreign policy .
that is also part of various demands by the human rights forum .
we are not satisfied with the level which human rights have in german foreign policy .
we continue to see significant deficits , also concerning china . steffen leidel interviewed beate wagner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday .

but there are differing notions in the eu on how best to stop its march . given europe 's difficulty on agreeing on most things , it should probably come as no surprise that eu members have different ideas on how best to stop the spread of bird flu . on wednesday , france and the netherlands received permission from the eu to begin vaccinating their bird populations against the avian virus h5n1 .
the strategy is highly controversial among experts and had previously been rejected by the eu as an appropriate way to stop the spread of the virus in domesticated bird populations . " our current methods of vaccination only mask the disease , " german agriculture minister horst seehofer told reporters outside of a meeting of eu agricultural ministers this week . critics argue that the vaccine does n't prevent the poultry from catching the virus , though the vaccine does enable the virus to spread undetected through bird populations because the symptoms are reduced . sparing the poultry industry but french and dutch officials remain resolute .
holland 's poultry industry was devastated by an outbreak of a similar virus in 2003 .
after starting in belgium , the virus forced poultry farmers to cull 30 million birds in order to avoid further contamination . " each decision is a weighing of the advantages and the disadvantages , " said johan bongers , a veterinarian at the central institute for animal disease control in lelystad , the netherlands .
" we know what it is to have avian influenza , we know how difficult it is to eradicate it .
that 's why we are in favor of vaccination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preventative measures are being undertaken in germany bongers admits that the vaccines are not optimal .
but he says improvements are being worked on at the moment .
vaccines have been used effectively in southeast asia - where h5n1 has been wreaking havoc since 2003 - but only as an additional measure to culling . european union regulations at the moment continue to favor culling . once a domesticated bird has been infected , health officials are required to set up a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- buffer zone around the affected farm .
owners of that farm , as well as any other farm with potential for infection are required to kill their poultry stocks . farmers in germany on the northern island of rügen , where the first infected swan was discovered , have already killed 2,500 birds as a precautionary measure . bad times ahead for kliewe 's farm " that is a hard measure maybe , but there should be no hesitation , " said cees vermeeren , of the brussels-based european poultry lobbying organization avec , which does n't recommend vaccination .
" if you hesitate at the beginning , then you have lost the battle . " but culling also means massive economic losses for poultry farmers , something france - ­ the world 's fourth-largest poultry producer - ­ is eager to avoid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culling could cost the poultry industry tens of millions of euros poultry farmers in northern germany are already feeling the impact .
on sunday , holger kliewe was forced to kill 2,000 of the geese , ducks and chickens he breeds to sell to the tourists who come to his farm and hotel . " i can understand these measures because we have regular visitors , products that we sell from our farm , and we have a restaurant , " said kliewe . but , he added , " our means of production have been taken away completely . "
for a farmer like kliewe , that means a loss of 70 percent of his income .
the other 30 percent , tourism , is taking a hit as well . no alarm , yet " all of us on rügen are suffering from a tarnished image , " kliewe said , adding that guests have already called to cancel their easter vacation reservations .
" the anti-flu measures will convince no one to come to the island in the near future .
that 's why we need this crisis to be contained as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen is worried about a tarnished image eu officials remain confident exactly that will happen .
for all the sensational headlines european editorialists have indulged in since the discovery of infected swans -lrb- germany 's bild tabloid splashed " the fear is growing " across its front page on tuesday -rrb- , the virus has yet to make the dangerous jump from wild fowl to domesticated birds . " it will be a problem when the first domesticated poultry are infected , " said uwe truyen , managing director of the institute of animal hygiene and veterinary health at the university of leipzig .

vaccines have been used effectively in southeast asia - where h5n1 has been wreaking havoc since 2003 - but only as an additional measure to culling . european union regulations at the moment continue to favor culling . once a domesticated bird has been infected , health officials are required to set up a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- buffer zone around the affected farm .
owners of that farm , as well as any other farm with potential for infection are required to kill their poultry stocks . farmers in germany on the northern island of rügen , where the first infected swan was discovered , have already killed 2,500 birds as a precautionary measure . bad times ahead for kliewe 's farm " that is a hard measure maybe , but there should be no hesitation , " said cees vermeeren , of the brussels-based european poultry lobbying organization avec , which does n't recommend vaccination .
" if you hesitate at the beginning , then you have lost the battle . " but culling also means massive economic losses for poultry farmers , something france - ­ the world 's fourth-largest poultry producer - ­ is eager to avoid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culling could cost the poultry industry tens of millions of euros poultry farmers in northern germany are already feeling the impact .
on sunday , holger kliewe was forced to kill 2,000 of the geese , ducks and chickens he breeds to sell to the tourists who come to his farm and hotel . " i can understand these measures because we have regular visitors , products that we sell from our farm , and we have a restaurant , " said kliewe . but , he added , " our means of production have been taken away completely . "
for a farmer like kliewe , that means a loss of 70 percent of his income .
the other 30 percent , tourism , is taking a hit as well . no alarm , yet " all of us on rügen are suffering from a tarnished image , " kliewe said , adding that guests have already called to cancel their easter vacation reservations .
" the anti-flu measures will convince no one to come to the island in the near future .
that 's why we need this crisis to be contained as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen is worried about a tarnished image eu officials remain confident exactly that will happen .
for all the sensational headlines european editorialists have indulged in since the discovery of infected swans -lrb- germany 's bild tabloid splashed " the fear is growing " across its front page on tuesday -rrb- , the virus has yet to make the dangerous jump from wild fowl to domesticated birds . " it will be a problem when the first domesticated poultry are infected , " said uwe truyen , managing director of the institute of animal hygiene and veterinary health at the university of leipzig .

the issue should be dealt with on various levels .
on the one hand , it could be addressed publicly during a press conference with the president .
but there should also be pressure on the level of existing dialogue that the topic is taken seriously .
there is the human rights dialogue - which has existed between the european union and china for years - and the dialogue on the bilateral level between germany and china .

does n't there need to be more pressure ? these forms of dialogue should only be continued when they bring results after a certain period of time .
the bilateral dialogue has to be settled .
it has to be clearly stated what sort of progress has to be achieved .
otherwise , there is no justification to continue it .
it just glosses over a situation in china which is very bad for human rights . former chancellor gerhard schröder was very reserved when it came to criticizing the human rights situation in china and russia .

beate wagner from the human rights forum told dw-world what the critical issues are . beate wagner is a member of the human rights forum 's coordination group and secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
the human rights forum is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . dw-world : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is visiting beijing .
the question of human rights will also be taken up , as is always the case when a high-ranking german politician travels to china .
in what form should steinmeier address the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beate wagner says more has to be done to step pressure on china to improve human rights beate wagner : human rights should be an integral part of german foreign policy .
the issue should be dealt with on various levels .
on the one hand , it could be addressed publicly during a press conference with the president .
but there should also be pressure on the level of existing dialogue that the topic is taken seriously .
there is the human rights dialogue - which has existed between the european union and china for years - and the dialogue on the bilateral level between germany and china .
there have to be questions about progress , in order for a true dialogue to develop .
this is apparently not the case at present . to what extent ?
where are the shortcomings ? the human rights situation in china is well known .
the number of people executed in china equals the amount executed in all other countries of the world put together .
you can even be executed there for tax crimes .
there is no freedom of the press or freedom of expression .
the human rights situation has not improved . in view of these facts , dialogue does n't appear to have really helped .
does n't there need to be more pressure ? these forms of dialogue should only be continued when they bring results after a certain period of time .
the bilateral dialogue has to be settled .
it has to be clearly stated what sort of progress has to be achieved .
otherwise , there is no justification to continue it .
it just glosses over a situation in china which is very bad for human rights . former chancellor gerhard schröder was very reserved when it came to criticizing the human rights situation in china and russia .
his former director of the chancellery steinmeier is now foreign minister .
will he set other priorities ? i ca n't judge that yet .
the human rights forum has positively noted that the new government with chancellor merkel 's statements has placed a different emphasis when it comes to russia and the united states .
we 'll have to see how that translates into concrete policies . honestly , though , are human rights really even a priority in china ?
are n't economic interests given greater significance ? of course , that 's something we fear .
and you have to continuously demand that human rights are an integral part of german foreign policy .
that is also part of various demands by the human rights forum .
we are not satisfied with the level which human rights have in german foreign policy .
we continue to see significant deficits , also concerning china . steffen leidel interviewed beate wagner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday .

this is apparently not the case at present . to what extent ?
where are the shortcomings ? the human rights situation in china is well known .
the number of people executed in china equals the amount executed in all other countries of the world put together .
you can even be executed there for tax crimes .
there is no freedom of the press or freedom of expression .
the human rights situation has not improved . in view of these facts , dialogue does n't appear to have really helped .
does n't there need to be more pressure ? these forms of dialogue should only be continued when they bring results after a certain period of time .
the bilateral dialogue has to be settled .
it has to be clearly stated what sort of progress has to be achieved .
otherwise , there is no justification to continue it .
it just glosses over a situation in china which is very bad for human rights . former chancellor gerhard schröder was very reserved when it came to criticizing the human rights situation in china and russia .
his former director of the chancellery steinmeier is now foreign minister .
will he set other priorities ? i ca n't judge that yet .
the human rights forum has positively noted that the new government with chancellor merkel 's statements has placed a different emphasis when it comes to russia and the united states .
we 'll have to see how that translates into concrete policies . honestly , though , are human rights really even a priority in china ?
are n't economic interests given greater significance ? of course , that 's something we fear .
and you have to continuously demand that human rights are an integral part of german foreign policy .
that is also part of various demands by the human rights forum .
we are not satisfied with the level which human rights have in german foreign policy .
we continue to see significant deficits , also concerning china . steffen leidel interviewed beate wagner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday .

22 , 2006 -rrb- choosing markets over morals chancellor schröder 's trips to china , turkey and russia mostly involve banging the drum for big business .

china has also indicated a harder line on iran . the question of copyright infringement is one of the west 's biggest concerns about investing in china . so when german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday won a pledge from his chinese counterpart to work harder at stemming the problem , the group of executives accompanying him must have breathed a sigh of relief . " the continuation of our economic relations must take place in a reliable environment , " steinmeier said at a news conference in peking during his first state trip to china . copyright concerns have grown in the past week following the announcement by a chinese company that it will build a magnetic levitation train to compete with the one siemens runs in shanghai . though no one accused the chinese of stealing the technology from siemens , european companies have often encountered outright theft when it comes to their technology patents . china issues strong iran statement li zhaoxing 's promise will be part of the discussion in a new bilateral commission created to encourage " strategic dialogue " between the two countries announced on wednesday . also part of the future dialogue would be china 's human rights situation , which steinmeier only briefly touched on , and china 's immense dependency on raw materials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank-walter steinmeier and li zhaoxing steinmeier was unable to get as much commitment on the question of iran 's nuclear program .
should all diplomatic avenues shut down , the us and eu-3 support referring the matter of iran 's nuclear program to the un security council where they would seek economic sanctions against the islamic republic .
a russian and chinese veto stand in the way . earlier this week , a chinese foreign ministry spokesman issued the country 's strongest statement yet on iran - urging teheran to once again suspend uranium-enriching activities it had taken up in january , defying the international community . on wednesday , li appealed for a diplomatic solution but said that china would not rush in deciding how to best deal with iran .
he said they would wait until the report by the international atomic energy association at the beginning of march . merkel will visit in may " we have to use this time , " he said .
steinmeier , in japan on tuesday , did not rule out the possibility of sanctions . the repeal of the eu weapon 's embargo on china - a favorite demand by steinmeier 's former boss , chancellor gerhard schröder - is not supported by merkel 's government .
but china said it will continue to press germany for its support .

" no one would be crazy enough to go into a stadium anyway , " he concluded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bird flu has already hit germany 's northern baltic island of rügen franz-josef holzenkamp , an agriculture policy expert with the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , also jumped on the bandwagon .
" if the virus becomes that dangerous , our priority must be people , not the world cup . " the debate started after the green party 's agriculture expert , bärbel höhn , and the leader of the world health organization 's flu program , klaus stöhr , both spoke of emergency measures regarding mass public gatherings in the event of a pandemic . " absurd " suggestion only fuels panic , says sports head # b # however , peter danckert , the chairman of the sports committee in the bundestag , called the idea " preposterous " and " absurd , " adding that spreading such paranoid speculation was " very unhelpful . " höhn later said that her statements were made in the context of a potential mutation in the h5n1 virus into a communicable variation between humans and that she was referring to all major events in the instance of such an outbreak .
she did not , at the present time , refer directly to the world cup in the current climate . who expert stöhr also qualified his previous statement , saying that he was referring to steps that would be taken in the event of a human bird flu pandemic .
in the case of the virus becoming a human-to-human infection " it would take a very , very brave person not to call off an event like the world cup , " he said . despite these moves to diffuse the row , danckert said that the best way to have avoided adding to the hysteria would have been to not have made the statements in the first place . the world cup organizing committee has not commented on the statements . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear borders on hysteria as bird flu hits europe while european governments are n't hitting the panic button as yet , the spread of bird flu has definitely got a lot of people fearing that the end is nigh .

a german parliamentary commission is meeting wednesday behind closed doors to examine the role of the country 's secret service in the iraq war . opposition parties in the parliamentary control commission reviewing the role of the german intelligence service in iraq are dissatisfied with the government 's report on the issue .

a german parliamentary commission is meeting wednesday behind closed doors to examine the role of the country 's secret service in the iraq war . opposition parties in the parliamentary control commission reviewing the role of the german intelligence service in iraq are dissatisfied with the government 's report on the issue .
members of the green and left parties said the official response to their questions was inadequate .
the german government handed over its report to the control commission earlier this week .
the commission is discussing the report behind closed doors on wednesday . the body 's green party representative , christian ströbele , said prior to the meeting he would seek a minority vote on the report . " the report does not meet my approval , " ströbele told the newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" we have to clarify if something is still open . " the report looks at the role of the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- in iraq , the cia 's abduction of german citizen khaled el-masri and secret cia flights in europe , as well as prisoner interrogations abroad by german investigators . commission seeks maximum transparency the commission will decide whether to call for a formal parliamentary probe after they 've discussed the report . but the commission 's left party representative , wolfgang neskovic , said a parliamentary inquiry to clarify the bnd affair was necessary .
he told german radio rbb-inforadio that the commission did not have " the necessary clarification instruments " that an inquiry would .
the commission could only draw on that information relinquished by the government , neskovic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission needs to clarify what the bnd did in iraq the federal government and the commission will jointly decide how much of the report will be made public .
but the opposition would like as much transparency as possible .
should the government 's information not satisfy the commission , a formal parliamentary probe is still an option . berlin failed to provide a clear answer on masri german prosecutors said they were investigating whether the government knew - sooner than it admitted - that the cia had wrongfully detained el-masri . " we are investigating this , " said christian schmidt-sommerfeld , chief state prosecutor in the southern city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri said undercover us agents mistakenly detained him the german government has for months faced allegations that it may have joined forces with the cia in the case of 42-year-old masri , who was held in afghanistan for five months as a suspected terrorist .
but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied a cover-up , saying late last year that berlin only learnt of the episode after the cia released masri in may 2004 . schmidt-sommerfeld said the government has been asked to clarify the matter .
although it has responded , it has so far failed to provide a clear answer , he said . masri has meanwhile claimed that one of the men who interrogated him while he was in afghanistan was a high-ranking member of the german police .
schmidt-sommerfeld said masri identified the policeman from photographs .
but when they met face to face earlier this week in new ulm - the southern german town where the former detainee lives - he could not be " absolutely sure " that it was the man who questioned him . " we need absolute certainty , " the prosecutor said .
he said his office would also try to establish whether the policeman was in afghanistan at the time . masri , an unemployed car salesman , claims he was drugged , questioned and tortured in a prison camp in afghanistan and later released without explanation in albania .
he has filed a lawsuit against the cia , demanding at least $ 75,000 dollars in damages . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us intelligence allegedly bugged german agents in iraq a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 .

germany 's national pep talk campaign " du bist deutschland " has come to an end .
to its creators , it was an unparalleled success .
to comedians , a bottomless well of material . after thousands of minutes of air time , as many pages of newsprint , and - likely - as many people who took delight in trashing its message , germany 's five-month nationwide pep talk campaign has come to an end . the privately-sponsored 30-million-euro -lrb- $ 25-million -rrb- campaign , " du bist deutschland " -lrb- you are germany -rrb- reached 58 percent of the population , according to a sample poll commissioned by the creators .

a campaign spokesman said it had been caricatured at least 300 times .
the labor union ig metall even printed postcards using the slogan to criticize changes in the labor market .
it was mocked for being everything from " kindergarten-like " to nazi-like , and got little support from the very industry responsible for its incarnation . mission accomplished creators jung von matt appear unperturbed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : du bist deutschland placard featuring albert einstein " we reached our goal , " wrote oliver voss , the creative head of the german pr agency in last sunday 's welt am sonntag .

after all , all publicity is good publicity .
and with close to 40 million people happy with its message , bertelsmann manager gunter thielen - the campaign 's originator - thinks it 's worth a second run . but thielen said he would n't continue to lead it .

china has also indicated a harder line on iran . the question of copyright infringement is one of the west 's biggest concerns about investing in china . so when german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday won a pledge from his chinese counterpart to work harder at stemming the problem , the group of executives accompanying him must have breathed a sigh of relief . " the continuation of our economic relations must take place in a reliable environment , " steinmeier said at a news conference in peking during his first state trip to china . copyright concerns have grown in the past week following the announcement by a chinese company that it will build a magnetic levitation train to compete with the one siemens runs in shanghai . though no one accused the chinese of stealing the technology from siemens , european companies have often encountered outright theft when it comes to their technology patents . china issues strong iran statement li zhaoxing 's promise will be part of the discussion in a new bilateral commission created to encourage " strategic dialogue " between the two countries announced on wednesday . also part of the future dialogue would be china 's human rights situation , which steinmeier only briefly touched on , and china 's immense dependency on raw materials .

a russian and chinese veto stand in the way . earlier this week , a chinese foreign ministry spokesman issued the country 's strongest statement yet on iran - urging teheran to once again suspend uranium-enriching activities it had taken up in january , defying the international community . on wednesday , li appealed for a diplomatic solution but said that china would not rush in deciding how to best deal with iran .
he said they would wait until the report by the international atomic energy association at the beginning of march . merkel will visit in may " we have to use this time , " he said .
steinmeier , in japan on tuesday , did not rule out the possibility of sanctions . the repeal of the eu weapon 's embargo on china - a favorite demand by steinmeier 's former boss , chancellor gerhard schröder - is not supported by merkel 's government .
but china said it will continue to press germany for its support .

but the government denied his arrest . conflicting reports dominated newspapers in the serbian capital on wednesday that the former bosnian serb general ratko mladic had been located , arrested and was even already on his way to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague . but the serbian government and police denied he was arrested , as did the tribunal 's chief prosecutor , carla del ponte . " mladic arrested , " read the only headline on the front page of nationalist daily glas javnosti with the general 's picture across the page . " ratko mladic and his bodyguard were arrested in a belgrade apartment , where negotiations on his voluntary surrender had been previously held , " the daily said , quoting a source close to serbian authorities . but the largest-circulation daily vecernje novosti only said that the noose had tightened on the fugitive , as " all political preparations for the arrest are completed and mladic is given only a little bit more time to decide to surrender . "
otherwise , he would be arrested by special police forces , the paper said . the influential pro-government politika daily cited anonymous sources as saying " the operation of capturing mladic started around 3:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0230 gmt -rrb- on tuesday in new belgrade , near a luxurious hotel . "
but it did not report on the end of the operation . reports of mladic 's arrest are " manipulation " some serbian and bosnian serb media reported that mladic had been located at cer mountain , some 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- west of belgrade .
negotiations were now underway on his surrender , they said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic allegedly ordered the murder of thousands of muslims all media , however , published the government spokesman 's denial that the fugitive had been apprehended . " the news that mladic was arrested is not true , " srdjan djuric said .
he said the report was " manipulation that harms , as well as hinders the serbian government 's efforts to bring the cooperation with the hague tribunal to a close . " previously , the independent serbian b92 radio quoted several unofficial sources that mladic had been captured in belgrade before being transferred to an air base at the northern bosnian town of tuzla .
the station on wednesday still stood by its report despite all the denials . a former senior secret police official told afp late on tuesday that an operation to locate and catch mladic was still underway , but " so far without any result . " pressure to capture mladic mounts from international community the 62-year-old former bosnian serb military chief is wanted for some of the worst atrocities committed during the 1992-95 war in bosnia .
mladic was indicted in 1995 over the three-and-a-half year siege of sarajevo and the july 1995 srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and boys .
it is considered the single worst atrocity in europe since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands were executed in srebrenica besides mladic , the only remaining war crimes suspects from the yugoslav wars in the mid-1990s are his wartime political leader , radovan karadzic , and four other ethnic serbs . reports of his impending capture follow mounting pressure from the international community for serbia to bring him before the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague . the serbian government has been giving strong signals that the net is closing on mladic after being clearly told by top international officials that talks on its closer ties with the european union would be frozen if belgrade failed to deliver him by the end of february . mladic had lived almost openly in belgrade until the october 2000 ouster of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
he then hid throughout the country under military protection until 2002 , according to a recent admission of the authorities . del ponte has said that he was still in hiding on serbian soil with the help of the military .
belgrade authorities have persistently denied any knowledge of his whereabouts . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war crimes suspect arrested in canaries croatian general ante gotovina , a fugitive accused of war crimes in the former yugoslavia , has been arrested at a luxury hotel in the canary islands .

he said the structure of the german education system fosters inequalities . the investigation was prompted by allegations that school students with immigrant and low-income backgrounds are hugely disadvantaged in primary schools in germany and that they have little chance to obtain academic qualifications . munoz said that it was difficult for outsiders to see through the german school system .
since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .
" but here as anywhere else poor people tend to care less about education .
in germany , however , this tendency is further aggravated by the fact that individual selection of specific schools starts very early in life .

" i would recommend a careful rethinking of the federal structures in the german school system , " he said .
" they are inhomogeneous and lead to inequalities .

" this will overcome the differences and inequalities that still exist today . " german parents organizations welcomed munoz 's visit and said that hints from outside were needed at this stage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.02.2006 spain 's endesa says germany 's e.on takeover bid too low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the e.on bid is successful , it will become a formidable force in the energy sector spanish electricity group endesa on tuesday dubbed a surprise 29.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 34.6 billion -rrb- takeover bid from german giant e.on insufficient . " the board considers that it -lrb- the offer -rrb- does not adequately reflect the true value of endesa , " the company said , while still welcoming the fact " the operation proposed by e.on maintains the integrity of endesa 's industrial project , without offloading shares . " the bid came after the spanish government had on feb .
3 given its blessing to a rival bid from spanish utility gas natural , which was 29 percent lower than e.on 's at 22.5-billion euros . gas natural responded to e.on 's entrance into the fray by saying it was continuing with its bid . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero threw the bid into further doubt when he said he wanted to retain national ownership of spain 's energy providers .
zapatero late tuesday held lengthy talks with e.on chairman wulf bernotat to discuss the takeover offer for his country 's leading electricity group and insisted he wanted to see spanish energy utilities remain in spanish hands , according to spanish government sources . el mundo newspaper 's web site said zapatero had told bernotat he was " worried " about the bid . responding to zapatero 's concerns about maintaining key sectors in spanish hands , gas natural said it wanted to create a company " with the capacity to compete at european and world level and with the capacity to maintain its centre of decision-making in spain . " combined energy giant would service 50 million clients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's takeover would create a world leader e.on 's all-cash offer , which would create the world 's leading power and gas supplier , risks upsetting zapatero 's plans to create a national champion in the spanish energy sector which could compete internationally in a consolidated market . the germans have offered 27.50 euros -lrb- $ 32.75 -rrb- per share compared with gas natural 's 21.30 euros per share , but the latter insisted tuesday that its own bid was in the interests of the electricity company 's shareholders and spain in general . the combination of e.on and endesa would create a group with 50 million customers and 107,000 employees , putting it ahead of companies such as electricite de france -lrb- edf -rrb- , tokyo electric , rwe , enel and suez , the german group said . the e.on takeover bid , announced tuesday in germany , had appeared to take madrid by surprise and analysts saw the cash bid as a blow to madrid 's support for " strong energy enterprises " at global level . a finance ministry spokesman earlier had told reporters it was " not very likely " the government would intervene , despite having a " golden share " in endesa through june 2007 that would enable it to block e.on. the spokesman said madrid was " totally neutral " on the german offer . the european union has ruled such state holdings illegal , and the ministry spokesman pointed out that madrid was debating the passage of legislation to bring spanish law in to line to meet the eu stricture . any obstruction could anger eu over liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy commissioner andris piebalgs wants more liberalization if the spanish government were to intervene and obstruct the bid it could spark a europe-wide political row .
some analysts believe the eu would accuse madrid of standing in the way of consolidation in europe 's energy markets . the european commission has been pushing for market liberalization reforms in the energy sector and has reportedly been getting increasingly impatient due to what it views as a widespread lack of progress in the implementation of reforms by member states . energy commissioner andris piebalgs said last week that the eu executive will issue warnings against three member states over slow implementation by the end of march without naming names , although unconfirmed reports suggest e.on and fellow german utility rwe ag as well as france 's edf , and italy 's enel spa have been accused of blocking competitors from operating on fair terms in their home markets . in its reaction , endesa 's board said " the price offered by e.on is clearly better than the rival gas natural bid but the board considers that it -lrb- the offer -rrb- does not adequately reflect the true value of endesa , " endesa said . madrid wants strong spanish enterprises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's government would respect the energy sector 's rules spanish secretary of state for communication fernando moraleda said madrid wanted to see the creation of " strong enterprises with spanish capital on board and with a capacity to compete on international markets .

he said the structure of the german education system fosters inequalities . the investigation was prompted by allegations that school students with immigrant and low-income backgrounds are hugely disadvantaged in primary schools in germany and that they have little chance to obtain academic qualifications . munoz said that it was difficult for outsiders to see through the german school system .
since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .
" but here as anywhere else poor people tend to care less about education .
in germany , however , this tendency is further aggravated by the fact that individual selection of specific schools starts very early in life . " oecd study highlights problems munoz pointed to an oecd study in the year 2000 that in his view showed a correlation between the german school system and poor results of its pupils .
in the study , german 15-year-olds were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will their backgrounds decide their academic future ?
the study also highlighted major inequalities in the school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers .
munoz said that compared with other countries strikingly few of these children would be able reach academic qualifications . also , stringent school selection procedures , starting at as young an age as eight or nine , foster school careers based on the will of parents rather than pupils ' merits , he said . " i would recommend a careful rethinking of the federal structures in the german school system , " he said .
" they are inhomogeneous and lead to inequalities .
the same applies to the school selection process .
at such an early stage it is unable to use the full potentials of pupils to their best . " reforms already under way germany 's education minister , anette schavan , underlined that major reforms to the system were already underway in all federal states .
they would resolve some of the problems touched on by munoz , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will school uniforms serve as equalizers ?
" our education system will change so that all pupils can decide on their school careers at every age , " schavan said .
" this will overcome the differences and inequalities that still exist today . " german parents organizations welcomed munoz 's visit and said that hints from outside were needed at this stage .
the parents also said that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un probes german school inequality the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .

china has also indicated a harder line on iran . the question of copyright infringement is one of the west 's biggest concerns about investing in china . so when german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday won a pledge from his chinese counterpart to work harder at stemming the problem , the group of executives accompanying him must have breathed a sigh of relief . " the continuation of our economic relations must take place in a reliable environment , " steinmeier said at a news conference in peking during his first state trip to china . copyright concerns have grown in the past week following the announcement by a chinese company that it will build a magnetic levitation train to compete with the one siemens runs in shanghai . though no one accused the chinese of stealing the technology from siemens , european companies have often encountered outright theft when it comes to their technology patents . china issues strong iran statement li zhaoxing 's promise will be part of the discussion in a new bilateral commission created to encourage " strategic dialogue " between the two countries announced on wednesday . also part of the future dialogue would be china 's human rights situation , which steinmeier only briefly touched on , and china 's immense dependency on raw materials .

a russian and chinese veto stand in the way . earlier this week , a chinese foreign ministry spokesman issued the country 's strongest statement yet on iran - urging teheran to once again suspend uranium-enriching activities it had taken up in january , defying the international community . on wednesday , li appealed for a diplomatic solution but said that china would not rush in deciding how to best deal with iran .
he said they would wait until the report by the international atomic energy association at the beginning of march . merkel will visit in may " we have to use this time , " he said .
steinmeier , in japan on tuesday , did not rule out the possibility of sanctions . the repeal of the eu weapon 's embargo on china - a favorite demand by steinmeier 's former boss , chancellor gerhard schröder - is not supported by merkel 's government .
but china said it will continue to press germany for its support .

" the bid came after the spanish government had on feb .
3 given its blessing to a rival bid from spanish utility gas natural , which was 29 percent lower than e.on 's at 22.5-billion euros . gas natural responded to e.on 's entrance into the fray by saying it was continuing with its bid . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero threw the bid into further doubt when he said he wanted to retain national ownership of spain 's energy providers .
zapatero late tuesday held lengthy talks with e.on chairman wulf bernotat to discuss the takeover offer for his country 's leading electricity group and insisted he wanted to see spanish energy utilities remain in spanish hands , according to spanish government sources . el mundo newspaper 's web site said zapatero had told bernotat he was " worried " about the bid . responding to zapatero 's concerns about maintaining key sectors in spanish hands , gas natural said it wanted to create a company " with the capacity to compete at european and world level and with the capacity to maintain its centre of decision-making in spain .

some analysts believe the eu would accuse madrid of standing in the way of consolidation in europe 's energy markets . the european commission has been pushing for market liberalization reforms in the energy sector and has reportedly been getting increasingly impatient due to what it views as a widespread lack of progress in the implementation of reforms by member states . energy commissioner andris piebalgs said last week that the eu executive will issue warnings against three member states over slow implementation by the end of march without naming names , although unconfirmed reports suggest e.on and fellow german utility rwe ag as well as france 's edf , and italy 's enel spa have been accused of blocking competitors from operating on fair terms in their home markets . in its reaction , endesa 's board said " the price offered by e.on is clearly better than the rival gas natural bid but the board considers that it -lrb- the offer -rrb- does not adequately reflect the true value of endesa , " endesa said . madrid wants strong spanish enterprises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's government would respect the energy sector 's rules spanish secretary of state for communication fernando moraleda said madrid wanted to see the creation of " strong enterprises with spanish capital on board and with a capacity to compete on international markets .

" however , the main conservative opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which said it had detected regional politicking in the original deal since the government has allies in the catalan region that is home to gas natural , accused the government of being " the only ones responsible " for the german counter-bid . there had been contradictory signs in spain concerning the gas natural bid .

a german parliamentary commission is meeting wednesday behind closed doors to examine the role of the country 's secret service in the iraq war . opposition parties in the parliamentary control commission reviewing the role of the german intelligence service in iraq are dissatisfied with the government 's report on the issue .
members of the green and left parties said the official response to their questions was inadequate .
the german government handed over its report to the control commission earlier this week .
the commission is discussing the report behind closed doors on wednesday . the body 's green party representative , christian ströbele , said prior to the meeting he would seek a minority vote on the report . " the report does not meet my approval , " ströbele told the newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" we have to clarify if something is still open . " the report looks at the role of the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- in iraq , the cia 's abduction of german citizen khaled el-masri and secret cia flights in europe , as well as prisoner interrogations abroad by german investigators . commission seeks maximum transparency the commission will decide whether to call for a formal parliamentary probe after they 've discussed the report . but the commission 's left party representative , wolfgang neskovic , said a parliamentary inquiry to clarify the bnd affair was necessary .
he told german radio rbb-inforadio that the commission did not have " the necessary clarification instruments " that an inquiry would .
the commission could only draw on that information relinquished by the government , neskovic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission needs to clarify what the bnd did in iraq the federal government and the commission will jointly decide how much of the report will be made public .
but the opposition would like as much transparency as possible .
should the government 's information not satisfy the commission , a formal parliamentary probe is still an option . berlin failed to provide a clear answer on masri german prosecutors said they were investigating whether the government knew - sooner than it admitted - that the cia had wrongfully detained el-masri . " we are investigating this , " said christian schmidt-sommerfeld , chief state prosecutor in the southern city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri said undercover us agents mistakenly detained him the german government has for months faced allegations that it may have joined forces with the cia in the case of 42-year-old masri , who was held in afghanistan for five months as a suspected terrorist .
but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied a cover-up , saying late last year that berlin only learnt of the episode after the cia released masri in may 2004 . schmidt-sommerfeld said the government has been asked to clarify the matter .
although it has responded , it has so far failed to provide a clear answer , he said . masri has meanwhile claimed that one of the men who interrogated him while he was in afghanistan was a high-ranking member of the german police .
schmidt-sommerfeld said masri identified the policeman from photographs .
but when they met face to face earlier this week in new ulm - the southern german town where the former detainee lives - he could not be " absolutely sure " that it was the man who questioned him . " we need absolute certainty , " the prosecutor said .
he said his office would also try to establish whether the policeman was in afghanistan at the time . masri , an unemployed car salesman , claims he was drugged , questioned and tortured in a prison camp in afghanistan and later released without explanation in albania .
he has filed a lawsuit against the cia , demanding at least $ 75,000 dollars in damages . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us intelligence allegedly bugged german agents in iraq a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 .

a german parliamentary commission is meeting wednesday behind closed doors to examine the role of the country 's secret service in the iraq war . opposition parties in the parliamentary control commission reviewing the role of the german intelligence service in iraq are dissatisfied with the government 's report on the issue .
members of the green and left parties said the official response to their questions was inadequate .
the german government handed over its report to the control commission earlier this week .
the commission is discussing the report behind closed doors on wednesday . the body 's green party representative , christian ströbele , said prior to the meeting he would seek a minority vote on the report . " the report does not meet my approval , " ströbele told the newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" we have to clarify if something is still open . " the report looks at the role of the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- in iraq , the cia 's abduction of german citizen khaled el-masri and secret cia flights in europe , as well as prisoner interrogations abroad by german investigators . commission seeks maximum transparency the commission will decide whether to call for a formal parliamentary probe after they 've discussed the report . but the commission 's left party representative , wolfgang neskovic , said a parliamentary inquiry to clarify the bnd affair was necessary .
he told german radio rbb-inforadio that the commission did not have " the necessary clarification instruments " that an inquiry would .
the commission could only draw on that information relinquished by the government , neskovic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission needs to clarify what the bnd did in iraq the federal government and the commission will jointly decide how much of the report will be made public .
but the opposition would like as much transparency as possible .
should the government 's information not satisfy the commission , a formal parliamentary probe is still an option . berlin failed to provide a clear answer on masri german prosecutors said they were investigating whether the government knew - sooner than it admitted - that the cia had wrongfully detained el-masri . " we are investigating this , " said christian schmidt-sommerfeld , chief state prosecutor in the southern city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri said undercover us agents mistakenly detained him the german government has for months faced allegations that it may have joined forces with the cia in the case of 42-year-old masri , who was held in afghanistan for five months as a suspected terrorist .
but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied a cover-up , saying late last year that berlin only learnt of the episode after the cia released masri in may 2004 . schmidt-sommerfeld said the government has been asked to clarify the matter .
although it has responded , it has so far failed to provide a clear answer , he said . masri has meanwhile claimed that one of the men who interrogated him while he was in afghanistan was a high-ranking member of the german police .
schmidt-sommerfeld said masri identified the policeman from photographs .
but when they met face to face earlier this week in new ulm - the southern german town where the former detainee lives - he could not be " absolutely sure " that it was the man who questioned him . " we need absolute certainty , " the prosecutor said .
he said his office would also try to establish whether the policeman was in afghanistan at the time . masri , an unemployed car salesman , claims he was drugged , questioned and tortured in a prison camp in afghanistan and later released without explanation in albania .
he has filed a lawsuit against the cia , demanding at least $ 75,000 dollars in damages . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us intelligence allegedly bugged german agents in iraq a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 .

a german parliamentary commission is meeting wednesday behind closed doors to examine the role of the country 's secret service in the iraq war . opposition parties in the parliamentary control commission reviewing the role of the german intelligence service in iraq are dissatisfied with the government 's report on the issue .
members of the green and left parties said the official response to their questions was inadequate .
the german government handed over its report to the control commission earlier this week .
the commission is discussing the report behind closed doors on wednesday . the body 's green party representative , christian ströbele , said prior to the meeting he would seek a minority vote on the report . " the report does not meet my approval , " ströbele told the newspaper mitteldeutsche zeitung .
" we have to clarify if something is still open . " the report looks at the role of the bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- in iraq , the cia 's abduction of german citizen khaled el-masri and secret cia flights in europe , as well as prisoner interrogations abroad by german investigators . commission seeks maximum transparency the commission will decide whether to call for a formal parliamentary probe after they 've discussed the report . but the commission 's left party representative , wolfgang neskovic , said a parliamentary inquiry to clarify the bnd affair was necessary .
he told german radio rbb-inforadio that the commission did not have " the necessary clarification instruments " that an inquiry would .
the commission could only draw on that information relinquished by the government , neskovic said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the commission needs to clarify what the bnd did in iraq the federal government and the commission will jointly decide how much of the report will be made public .
but the opposition would like as much transparency as possible .
should the government 's information not satisfy the commission , a formal parliamentary probe is still an option . berlin failed to provide a clear answer on masri german prosecutors said they were investigating whether the government knew - sooner than it admitted - that the cia had wrongfully detained el-masri . " we are investigating this , " said christian schmidt-sommerfeld , chief state prosecutor in the southern city of munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masri said undercover us agents mistakenly detained him the german government has for months faced allegations that it may have joined forces with the cia in the case of 42-year-old masri , who was held in afghanistan for five months as a suspected terrorist .
but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has denied a cover-up , saying late last year that berlin only learnt of the episode after the cia released masri in may 2004 . schmidt-sommerfeld said the government has been asked to clarify the matter .
although it has responded , it has so far failed to provide a clear answer , he said . masri has meanwhile claimed that one of the men who interrogated him while he was in afghanistan was a high-ranking member of the german police .
schmidt-sommerfeld said masri identified the policeman from photographs .
but when they met face to face earlier this week in new ulm - the southern german town where the former detainee lives - he could not be " absolutely sure " that it was the man who questioned him . " we need absolute certainty , " the prosecutor said .
he said his office would also try to establish whether the policeman was in afghanistan at the time . masri , an unemployed car salesman , claims he was drugged , questioned and tortured in a prison camp in afghanistan and later released without explanation in albania .
he has filed a lawsuit against the cia , demanding at least $ 75,000 dollars in damages . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us intelligence allegedly bugged german agents in iraq a german newspaper has written that us intelligence services spied on two german agents who remained in iraq during the us-led war in 2003 .

germany 's national pep talk campaign " du bist deutschland " has come to an end .

but there are differing notions in the eu on how best to stop its march . given europe 's difficulty on agreeing on most things , it should probably come as no surprise that eu members have different ideas on how best to stop the spread of bird flu . on wednesday , france and the netherlands received permission from the eu to begin vaccinating their bird populations against the avian virus h5n1 .
the strategy is highly controversial among experts and had previously been rejected by the eu as an appropriate way to stop the spread of the virus in domesticated bird populations . " our current methods of vaccination only mask the disease , " german agriculture minister horst seehofer told reporters outside of a meeting of eu agricultural ministers this week . critics argue that the vaccine does n't prevent the poultry from catching the virus , though the vaccine does enable the virus to spread undetected through bird populations because the symptoms are reduced . sparing the poultry industry but french and dutch officials remain resolute .
holland 's poultry industry was devastated by an outbreak of a similar virus in 2003 .
after starting in belgium , the virus forced poultry farmers to cull 30 million birds in order to avoid further contamination . " each decision is a weighing of the advantages and the disadvantages , " said johan bongers , a veterinarian at the central institute for animal disease control in lelystad , the netherlands .
" we know what it is to have avian influenza , we know how difficult it is to eradicate it .
that 's why we are in favor of vaccination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preventative measures are being undertaken in germany bongers admits that the vaccines are not optimal .
but he says improvements are being worked on at the moment .
vaccines have been used effectively in southeast asia - where h5n1 has been wreaking havoc since 2003 - but only as an additional measure to culling . european union regulations at the moment continue to favor culling . once a domesticated bird has been infected , health officials are required to set up a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- buffer zone around the affected farm .
owners of that farm , as well as any other farm with potential for infection are required to kill their poultry stocks . farmers in germany on the northern island of rügen , where the first infected swan was discovered , have already killed 2,500 birds as a precautionary measure . bad times ahead for kliewe 's farm " that is a hard measure maybe , but there should be no hesitation , " said cees vermeeren , of the brussels-based european poultry lobbying organization avec , which does n't recommend vaccination .
" if you hesitate at the beginning , then you have lost the battle . " but culling also means massive economic losses for poultry farmers , something france - ­ the world 's fourth-largest poultry producer - ­ is eager to avoid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culling could cost the poultry industry tens of millions of euros poultry farmers in northern germany are already feeling the impact .
on sunday , holger kliewe was forced to kill 2,000 of the geese , ducks and chickens he breeds to sell to the tourists who come to his farm and hotel . " i can understand these measures because we have regular visitors , products that we sell from our farm , and we have a restaurant , " said kliewe . but , he added , " our means of production have been taken away completely . "
for a farmer like kliewe , that means a loss of 70 percent of his income .
the other 30 percent , tourism , is taking a hit as well . no alarm , yet " all of us on rügen are suffering from a tarnished image , " kliewe said , adding that guests have already called to cancel their easter vacation reservations .
" the anti-flu measures will convince no one to come to the island in the near future .
that 's why we need this crisis to be contained as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen is worried about a tarnished image eu officials remain confident exactly that will happen .
for all the sensational headlines european editorialists have indulged in since the discovery of infected swans -lrb- germany 's bild tabloid splashed " the fear is growing " across its front page on tuesday -rrb- , the virus has yet to make the dangerous jump from wild fowl to domesticated birds . " it will be a problem when the first domesticated poultry are infected , " said uwe truyen , managing director of the institute of animal hygiene and veterinary health at the university of leipzig .

" the board considers that it -lrb- the offer -rrb- does not adequately reflect the true value of endesa , " the company said , while still welcoming the fact " the operation proposed by e.on maintains the integrity of endesa 's industrial project , without offloading shares . " the bid came after the spanish government had on feb .
3 given its blessing to a rival bid from spanish utility gas natural , which was 29 percent lower than e.on 's at 22.5-billion euros . gas natural responded to e.on 's entrance into the fray by saying it was continuing with its bid . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero threw the bid into further doubt when he said he wanted to retain national ownership of spain 's energy providers .
zapatero late tuesday held lengthy talks with e.on chairman wulf bernotat to discuss the takeover offer for his country 's leading electricity group and insisted he wanted to see spanish energy utilities remain in spanish hands , according to spanish government sources . el mundo newspaper 's web site said zapatero had told bernotat he was " worried " about the bid . responding to zapatero 's concerns about maintaining key sectors in spanish hands , gas natural said it wanted to create a company " with the capacity to compete at european and world level and with the capacity to maintain its centre of decision-making in spain . " combined energy giant would service 50 million clients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's takeover would create a world leader e.on 's all-cash offer , which would create the world 's leading power and gas supplier , risks upsetting zapatero 's plans to create a national champion in the spanish energy sector which could compete internationally in a consolidated market . the germans have offered 27.50 euros -lrb- $ 32.75 -rrb- per share compared with gas natural 's 21.30 euros per share , but the latter insisted tuesday that its own bid was in the interests of the electricity company 's shareholders and spain in general . the combination of e.on and endesa would create a group with 50 million customers and 107,000 employees , putting it ahead of companies such as electricite de france -lrb- edf -rrb- , tokyo electric , rwe , enel and suez , the german group said . the e.on takeover bid , announced tuesday in germany , had appeared to take madrid by surprise and analysts saw the cash bid as a blow to madrid 's support for " strong energy enterprises " at global level . a finance ministry spokesman earlier had told reporters it was " not very likely " the government would intervene , despite having a " golden share " in endesa through june 2007 that would enable it to block e.on. the spokesman said madrid was " totally neutral " on the german offer . the european union has ruled such state holdings illegal , and the ministry spokesman pointed out that madrid was debating the passage of legislation to bring spanish law in to line to meet the eu stricture . any obstruction could anger eu over liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy commissioner andris piebalgs wants more liberalization if the spanish government were to intervene and obstruct the bid it could spark a europe-wide political row .
some analysts believe the eu would accuse madrid of standing in the way of consolidation in europe 's energy markets . the european commission has been pushing for market liberalization reforms in the energy sector and has reportedly been getting increasingly impatient due to what it views as a widespread lack of progress in the implementation of reforms by member states . energy commissioner andris piebalgs said last week that the eu executive will issue warnings against three member states over slow implementation by the end of march without naming names , although unconfirmed reports suggest e.on and fellow german utility rwe ag as well as france 's edf , and italy 's enel spa have been accused of blocking competitors from operating on fair terms in their home markets . in its reaction , endesa 's board said " the price offered by e.on is clearly better than the rival gas natural bid but the board considers that it -lrb- the offer -rrb- does not adequately reflect the true value of endesa , " endesa said . madrid wants strong spanish enterprises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's government would respect the energy sector 's rules spanish secretary of state for communication fernando moraleda said madrid wanted to see the creation of " strong enterprises with spanish capital on board and with a capacity to compete on international markets . " asked about future government policy regarding endesa , moraleda added that madrid respected the rules of the market . senior ruling socialist party official alfredo perez rubalcaba said madrid would apply " the same criteria " to the case as it had earlier with gas natural , saying that what counted was " the general interest , the interests of consumers and the strategic character of the sector . " however , the main conservative opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which said it had detected regional politicking in the original deal since the government has allies in the catalan region that is home to gas natural , accused the government of being " the only ones responsible " for the german counter-bid . there had been contradictory signs in spain concerning the gas natural bid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bird flu : the continuing threat germany 's media tangle with bird flu bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion the westward migration of bird flu bird flu : the facts europe -pipe- 22.02.2006 europe diverges on how to stop spread of bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and the netherlands want to go ahead with bird vaccinations past brushes and the devastation wreaked in asia have taught europe the dangers that bird flu brings with it .
but there are differing notions in the eu on how best to stop its march . given europe 's difficulty on agreeing on most things , it should probably come as no surprise that eu members have different ideas on how best to stop the spread of bird flu . on wednesday , france and the netherlands received permission from the eu to begin vaccinating their bird populations against the avian virus h5n1 .
the strategy is highly controversial among experts and had previously been rejected by the eu as an appropriate way to stop the spread of the virus in domesticated bird populations . " our current methods of vaccination only mask the disease , " german agriculture minister horst seehofer told reporters outside of a meeting of eu agricultural ministers this week . critics argue that the vaccine does n't prevent the poultry from catching the virus , though the vaccine does enable the virus to spread undetected through bird populations because the symptoms are reduced . sparing the poultry industry but french and dutch officials remain resolute .
holland 's poultry industry was devastated by an outbreak of a similar virus in 2003 .
after starting in belgium , the virus forced poultry farmers to cull 30 million birds in order to avoid further contamination . " each decision is a weighing of the advantages and the disadvantages , " said johan bongers , a veterinarian at the central institute for animal disease control in lelystad , the netherlands .
" we know what it is to have avian influenza , we know how difficult it is to eradicate it .
that 's why we are in favor of vaccination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preventative measures are being undertaken in germany bongers admits that the vaccines are not optimal .
but he says improvements are being worked on at the moment .
vaccines have been used effectively in southeast asia - where h5n1 has been wreaking havoc since 2003 - but only as an additional measure to culling . european union regulations at the moment continue to favor culling . once a domesticated bird has been infected , health officials are required to set up a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- buffer zone around the affected farm .
owners of that farm , as well as any other farm with potential for infection are required to kill their poultry stocks . farmers in germany on the northern island of rügen , where the first infected swan was discovered , have already killed 2,500 birds as a precautionary measure . bad times ahead for kliewe 's farm " that is a hard measure maybe , but there should be no hesitation , " said cees vermeeren , of the brussels-based european poultry lobbying organization avec , which does n't recommend vaccination .
" if you hesitate at the beginning , then you have lost the battle . " but culling also means massive economic losses for poultry farmers , something france - ­ the world 's fourth-largest poultry producer - ­ is eager to avoid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culling could cost the poultry industry tens of millions of euros poultry farmers in northern germany are already feeling the impact .
on sunday , holger kliewe was forced to kill 2,000 of the geese , ducks and chickens he breeds to sell to the tourists who come to his farm and hotel . " i can understand these measures because we have regular visitors , products that we sell from our farm , and we have a restaurant , " said kliewe . but , he added , " our means of production have been taken away completely . "
for a farmer like kliewe , that means a loss of 70 percent of his income .
the other 30 percent , tourism , is taking a hit as well . no alarm , yet " all of us on rügen are suffering from a tarnished image , " kliewe said , adding that guests have already called to cancel their easter vacation reservations .
" the anti-flu measures will convince no one to come to the island in the near future .
that 's why we need this crisis to be contained as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen is worried about a tarnished image eu officials remain confident exactly that will happen .
for all the sensational headlines european editorialists have indulged in since the discovery of infected swans -lrb- germany 's bild tabloid splashed " the fear is growing " across its front page on tuesday -rrb- , the virus has yet to make the dangerous jump from wild fowl to domesticated birds . " it will be a problem when the first domesticated poultry are infected , " said uwe truyen , managing director of the institute of animal hygiene and veterinary health at the university of leipzig .

beate wagner from the human rights forum told dw-world what the critical issues are . beate wagner is a member of the human rights forum 's coordination group and secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
the human rights forum is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . dw-world : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is visiting beijing .
the question of human rights will also be taken up , as is always the case when a high-ranking german politician travels to china .
in what form should steinmeier address the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beate wagner says more has to be done to step pressure on china to improve human rights beate wagner : human rights should be an integral part of german foreign policy .
the issue should be dealt with on various levels .
on the one hand , it could be addressed publicly during a press conference with the president .
but there should also be pressure on the level of existing dialogue that the topic is taken seriously .
there is the human rights dialogue - which has existed between the european union and china for years - and the dialogue on the bilateral level between germany and china .
there have to be questions about progress , in order for a true dialogue to develop .
this is apparently not the case at present . to what extent ?
where are the shortcomings ? the human rights situation in china is well known .
the number of people executed in china equals the amount executed in all other countries of the world put together .
you can even be executed there for tax crimes .
there is no freedom of the press or freedom of expression .
the human rights situation has not improved . in view of these facts , dialogue does n't appear to have really helped .
does n't there need to be more pressure ? these forms of dialogue should only be continued when they bring results after a certain period of time .
the bilateral dialogue has to be settled .
it has to be clearly stated what sort of progress has to be achieved .
otherwise , there is no justification to continue it .
it just glosses over a situation in china which is very bad for human rights . former chancellor gerhard schröder was very reserved when it came to criticizing the human rights situation in china and russia .
his former director of the chancellery steinmeier is now foreign minister .
will he set other priorities ? i ca n't judge that yet .
the human rights forum has positively noted that the new government with chancellor merkel 's statements has placed a different emphasis when it comes to russia and the united states .
we 'll have to see how that translates into concrete policies . honestly , though , are human rights really even a priority in china ?
are n't economic interests given greater significance ? of course , that 's something we fear .
and you have to continuously demand that human rights are an integral part of german foreign policy .
that is also part of various demands by the human rights forum .
we are not satisfied with the level which human rights have in german foreign policy .
we continue to see significant deficits , also concerning china . steffen leidel interviewed beate wagner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday .
-lrb- feb .

beate wagner from the human rights forum told dw-world what the critical issues are . beate wagner is a member of the human rights forum 's coordination group and secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
the human rights forum is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . dw-world : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is visiting beijing .
the question of human rights will also be taken up , as is always the case when a high-ranking german politician travels to china .
in what form should steinmeier address the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beate wagner says more has to be done to step pressure on china to improve human rights beate wagner : human rights should be an integral part of german foreign policy .
the issue should be dealt with on various levels .
on the one hand , it could be addressed publicly during a press conference with the president .
but there should also be pressure on the level of existing dialogue that the topic is taken seriously .
there is the human rights dialogue - which has existed between the european union and china for years - and the dialogue on the bilateral level between germany and china .
there have to be questions about progress , in order for a true dialogue to develop .
this is apparently not the case at present . to what extent ?
where are the shortcomings ? the human rights situation in china is well known .
the number of people executed in china equals the amount executed in all other countries of the world put together .
you can even be executed there for tax crimes .
there is no freedom of the press or freedom of expression .
the human rights situation has not improved . in view of these facts , dialogue does n't appear to have really helped .
does n't there need to be more pressure ? these forms of dialogue should only be continued when they bring results after a certain period of time .
the bilateral dialogue has to be settled .
it has to be clearly stated what sort of progress has to be achieved .
otherwise , there is no justification to continue it .
it just glosses over a situation in china which is very bad for human rights . former chancellor gerhard schröder was very reserved when it came to criticizing the human rights situation in china and russia .
his former director of the chancellery steinmeier is now foreign minister .
will he set other priorities ? i ca n't judge that yet .
the human rights forum has positively noted that the new government with chancellor merkel 's statements has placed a different emphasis when it comes to russia and the united states .
we 'll have to see how that translates into concrete policies . honestly , though , are human rights really even a priority in china ?
are n't economic interests given greater significance ? of course , that 's something we fear .
and you have to continuously demand that human rights are an integral part of german foreign policy .
that is also part of various demands by the human rights forum .

beate wagner from the human rights forum told dw-world what the critical issues are . beate wagner is a member of the human rights forum 's coordination group and secretary general of the german society for the united nations .
the human rights forum is a network of more than 40 german non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , which critically monitor the human rights policies of the german government . dw-world : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is visiting beijing .
the question of human rights will also be taken up , as is always the case when a high-ranking german politician travels to china .
in what form should steinmeier address the issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beate wagner says more has to be done to step pressure on china to improve human rights beate wagner : human rights should be an integral part of german foreign policy .
the issue should be dealt with on various levels .
on the one hand , it could be addressed publicly during a press conference with the president .
but there should also be pressure on the level of existing dialogue that the topic is taken seriously .
there is the human rights dialogue - which has existed between the european union and china for years - and the dialogue on the bilateral level between germany and china .
there have to be questions about progress , in order for a true dialogue to develop .
this is apparently not the case at present . to what extent ?
where are the shortcomings ? the human rights situation in china is well known .
the number of people executed in china equals the amount executed in all other countries of the world put together .
you can even be executed there for tax crimes .
there is no freedom of the press or freedom of expression .
the human rights situation has not improved . in view of these facts , dialogue does n't appear to have really helped .
does n't there need to be more pressure ? these forms of dialogue should only be continued when they bring results after a certain period of time .
the bilateral dialogue has to be settled .
it has to be clearly stated what sort of progress has to be achieved .
otherwise , there is no justification to continue it .
it just glosses over a situation in china which is very bad for human rights . former chancellor gerhard schröder was very reserved when it came to criticizing the human rights situation in china and russia .
his former director of the chancellery steinmeier is now foreign minister .
will he set other priorities ? i ca n't judge that yet .
the human rights forum has positively noted that the new government with chancellor merkel 's statements has placed a different emphasis when it comes to russia and the united states .
we 'll have to see how that translates into concrete policies . honestly , though , are human rights really even a priority in china ?
are n't economic interests given greater significance ? of course , that 's something we fear .
and you have to continuously demand that human rights are an integral part of german foreign policy .
that is also part of various demands by the human rights forum .
we are not satisfied with the level which human rights have in german foreign policy .
we continue to see significant deficits , also concerning china . steffen leidel interviewed beate wagner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german foreign minister to walk diplomatic tightrope in china stressing germany 's stance against lifting the eu arms embargo , talking tough on human rights and deepening business ties - foreign minister steinmeier will have his hands full when he visits china wednesday .
-lrb- feb .
22 , 2006 -rrb- choosing markets over morals chancellor schröder 's trips to china , turkey and russia mostly involve banging the drum for big business .
but , critics say his foreign policy there suffers from a glaring blunder - the lack of mention of human rights .

he said the structure of the german education system fosters inequalities . the investigation was prompted by allegations that school students with immigrant and low-income backgrounds are hugely disadvantaged in primary schools in germany and that they have little chance to obtain academic qualifications . munoz said that it was difficult for outsiders to see through the german school system .
since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .
" but here as anywhere else poor people tend to care less about education .
in germany , however , this tendency is further aggravated by the fact that individual selection of specific schools starts very early in life . " oecd study highlights problems munoz pointed to an oecd study in the year 2000 that in his view showed a correlation between the german school system and poor results of its pupils .
in the study , german 15-year-olds were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will their backgrounds decide their academic future ?
the study also highlighted major inequalities in the school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers .
munoz said that compared with other countries strikingly few of these children would be able reach academic qualifications . also , stringent school selection procedures , starting at as young an age as eight or nine , foster school careers based on the will of parents rather than pupils ' merits , he said . " i would recommend a careful rethinking of the federal structures in the german school system , " he said .
" they are inhomogeneous and lead to inequalities .
the same applies to the school selection process .
at such an early stage it is unable to use the full potentials of pupils to their best . " reforms already under way germany 's education minister , anette schavan , underlined that major reforms to the system were already underway in all federal states .
they would resolve some of the problems touched on by munoz , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will school uniforms serve as equalizers ?
" our education system will change so that all pupils can decide on their school careers at every age , " schavan said .
" this will overcome the differences and inequalities that still exist today . " german parents organizations welcomed munoz 's visit and said that hints from outside were needed at this stage .
the parents also said that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un probes german school inequality the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .

he said the structure of the german education system fosters inequalities . the investigation was prompted by allegations that school students with immigrant and low-income backgrounds are hugely disadvantaged in primary schools in germany and that they have little chance to obtain academic qualifications . munoz said that it was difficult for outsiders to see through the german school system .
since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .
" but here as anywhere else poor people tend to care less about education .
in germany , however , this tendency is further aggravated by the fact that individual selection of specific schools starts very early in life . " oecd study highlights problems munoz pointed to an oecd study in the year 2000 that in his view showed a correlation between the german school system and poor results of its pupils .
in the study , german 15-year-olds were found to be unable to reach even the worldwide average in reading , mathematics and natural science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will their backgrounds decide their academic future ?
the study also highlighted major inequalities in the school system , especially with regard to the children of immigrants and manual workers .
munoz said that compared with other countries strikingly few of these children would be able reach academic qualifications . also , stringent school selection procedures , starting at as young an age as eight or nine , foster school careers based on the will of parents rather than pupils ' merits , he said . " i would recommend a careful rethinking of the federal structures in the german school system , " he said .
" they are inhomogeneous and lead to inequalities .
the same applies to the school selection process .
at such an early stage it is unable to use the full potentials of pupils to their best . " reforms already under way germany 's education minister , anette schavan , underlined that major reforms to the system were already underway in all federal states .
they would resolve some of the problems touched on by munoz , she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will school uniforms serve as equalizers ?
" our education system will change so that all pupils can decide on their school careers at every age , " schavan said .
" this will overcome the differences and inequalities that still exist today . " german parents organizations welcomed munoz 's visit and said that hints from outside were needed at this stage .
the parents also said that a drop-out rate of 10 percent and the fact that 25 percent of school students lack even basic knowledge should be seen as a disgrace for a highly industrialized country like germany . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un probes german school inequality the un believes germany has a human rights problem - at least where its schools are concerned .

" the board considers that it -lrb- the offer -rrb- does not adequately reflect the true value of endesa , " the company said , while still welcoming the fact " the operation proposed by e.on maintains the integrity of endesa 's industrial project , without offloading shares . " the bid came after the spanish government had on feb .
3 given its blessing to a rival bid from spanish utility gas natural , which was 29 percent lower than e.on 's at 22.5-billion euros . gas natural responded to e.on 's entrance into the fray by saying it was continuing with its bid . spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero threw the bid into further doubt when he said he wanted to retain national ownership of spain 's energy providers .
zapatero late tuesday held lengthy talks with e.on chairman wulf bernotat to discuss the takeover offer for his country 's leading electricity group and insisted he wanted to see spanish energy utilities remain in spanish hands , according to spanish government sources . el mundo newspaper 's web site said zapatero had told bernotat he was " worried " about the bid . responding to zapatero 's concerns about maintaining key sectors in spanish hands , gas natural said it wanted to create a company " with the capacity to compete at european and world level and with the capacity to maintain its centre of decision-making in spain . " combined energy giant would service 50 million clients bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's takeover would create a world leader e.on 's all-cash offer , which would create the world 's leading power and gas supplier , risks upsetting zapatero 's plans to create a national champion in the spanish energy sector which could compete internationally in a consolidated market . the germans have offered 27.50 euros -lrb- $ 32.75 -rrb- per share compared with gas natural 's 21.30 euros per share , but the latter insisted tuesday that its own bid was in the interests of the electricity company 's shareholders and spain in general . the combination of e.on and endesa would create a group with 50 million customers and 107,000 employees , putting it ahead of companies such as electricite de france -lrb- edf -rrb- , tokyo electric , rwe , enel and suez , the german group said . the e.on takeover bid , announced tuesday in germany , had appeared to take madrid by surprise and analysts saw the cash bid as a blow to madrid 's support for " strong energy enterprises " at global level . a finance ministry spokesman earlier had told reporters it was " not very likely " the government would intervene , despite having a " golden share " in endesa through june 2007 that would enable it to block e.on. the spokesman said madrid was " totally neutral " on the german offer . the european union has ruled such state holdings illegal , and the ministry spokesman pointed out that madrid was debating the passage of legislation to bring spanish law in to line to meet the eu stricture . any obstruction could anger eu over liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy commissioner andris piebalgs wants more liberalization if the spanish government were to intervene and obstruct the bid it could spark a europe-wide political row .
some analysts believe the eu would accuse madrid of standing in the way of consolidation in europe 's energy markets . the european commission has been pushing for market liberalization reforms in the energy sector and has reportedly been getting increasingly impatient due to what it views as a widespread lack of progress in the implementation of reforms by member states . energy commissioner andris piebalgs said last week that the eu executive will issue warnings against three member states over slow implementation by the end of march without naming names , although unconfirmed reports suggest e.on and fellow german utility rwe ag as well as france 's edf , and italy 's enel spa have been accused of blocking competitors from operating on fair terms in their home markets . in its reaction , endesa 's board said " the price offered by e.on is clearly better than the rival gas natural bid but the board considers that it -lrb- the offer -rrb- does not adequately reflect the true value of endesa , " endesa said . madrid wants strong spanish enterprises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero 's government would respect the energy sector 's rules spanish secretary of state for communication fernando moraleda said madrid wanted to see the creation of " strong enterprises with spanish capital on board and with a capacity to compete on international markets . " asked about future government policy regarding endesa , moraleda added that madrid respected the rules of the market . senior ruling socialist party official alfredo perez rubalcaba said madrid would apply " the same criteria " to the case as it had earlier with gas natural , saying that what counted was " the general interest , the interests of consumers and the strategic character of the sector . " however , the main conservative opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , which said it had detected regional politicking in the original deal since the government has allies in the catalan region that is home to gas natural , accused the government of being " the only ones responsible " for the german counter-bid . there had been contradictory signs in spain concerning the gas natural bid .
the market regulator approved the deal but with conditions while the competition regulator was opposed . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany not affected by russian gas dispute even though russia is the largest supplier of natural gas to germany , consumers here have no reason to worry that their supplies will suffer as a consequence of the russian-ukrainian dispute .

but the government denied his arrest . conflicting reports dominated newspapers in the serbian capital on wednesday that the former bosnian serb general ratko mladic had been located , arrested and was even already on his way to the un war crimes tribunal in the hague . but the serbian government and police denied he was arrested , as did the tribunal 's chief prosecutor , carla del ponte . " mladic arrested , " read the only headline on the front page of nationalist daily glas javnosti with the general 's picture across the page . " ratko mladic and his bodyguard were arrested in a belgrade apartment , where negotiations on his voluntary surrender had been previously held , " the daily said , quoting a source close to serbian authorities . but the largest-circulation daily vecernje novosti only said that the noose had tightened on the fugitive , as " all political preparations for the arrest are completed and mladic is given only a little bit more time to decide to surrender . "
otherwise , he would be arrested by special police forces , the paper said . the influential pro-government politika daily cited anonymous sources as saying " the operation of capturing mladic started around 3:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0230 gmt -rrb- on tuesday in new belgrade , near a luxurious hotel . "
but it did not report on the end of the operation . reports of mladic 's arrest are " manipulation " some serbian and bosnian serb media reported that mladic had been located at cer mountain , some 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- west of belgrade .
negotiations were now underway on his surrender , they said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic allegedly ordered the murder of thousands of muslims all media , however , published the government spokesman 's denial that the fugitive had been apprehended . " the news that mladic was arrested is not true , " srdjan djuric said .
he said the report was " manipulation that harms , as well as hinders the serbian government 's efforts to bring the cooperation with the hague tribunal to a close . " previously , the independent serbian b92 radio quoted several unofficial sources that mladic had been captured in belgrade before being transferred to an air base at the northern bosnian town of tuzla .
the station on wednesday still stood by its report despite all the denials . a former senior secret police official told afp late on tuesday that an operation to locate and catch mladic was still underway , but " so far without any result . " pressure to capture mladic mounts from international community the 62-year-old former bosnian serb military chief is wanted for some of the worst atrocities committed during the 1992-95 war in bosnia .
mladic was indicted in 1995 over the three-and-a-half year siege of sarajevo and the july 1995 srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and boys .
it is considered the single worst atrocity in europe since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands were executed in srebrenica besides mladic , the only remaining war crimes suspects from the yugoslav wars in the mid-1990s are his wartime political leader , radovan karadzic , and four other ethnic serbs . reports of his impending capture follow mounting pressure from the international community for serbia to bring him before the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague . the serbian government has been giving strong signals that the net is closing on mladic after being clearly told by top international officials that talks on its closer ties with the european union would be frozen if belgrade failed to deliver him by the end of february . mladic had lived almost openly in belgrade until the october 2000 ouster of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
he then hid throughout the country under military protection until 2002 , according to a recent admission of the authorities . del ponte has said that he was still in hiding on serbian soil with the help of the military .
belgrade authorities have persistently denied any knowledge of his whereabouts . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war crimes suspect arrested in canaries croatian general ante gotovina , a fugitive accused of war crimes in the former yugoslavia , has been arrested at a luxury hotel in the canary islands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bird flu : the continuing threat germany 's media tangle with bird flu bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion the westward migration of bird flu bird flu : the facts europe -pipe- 22.02.2006 europe diverges on how to stop spread of bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and the netherlands want to go ahead with bird vaccinations past brushes and the devastation wreaked in asia have taught europe the dangers that bird flu brings with it .
but there are differing notions in the eu on how best to stop its march . given europe 's difficulty on agreeing on most things , it should probably come as no surprise that eu members have different ideas on how best to stop the spread of bird flu . on wednesday , france and the netherlands received permission from the eu to begin vaccinating their bird populations against the avian virus h5n1 .
the strategy is highly controversial among experts and had previously been rejected by the eu as an appropriate way to stop the spread of the virus in domesticated bird populations . " our current methods of vaccination only mask the disease , " german agriculture minister horst seehofer told reporters outside of a meeting of eu agricultural ministers this week . critics argue that the vaccine does n't prevent the poultry from catching the virus , though the vaccine does enable the virus to spread undetected through bird populations because the symptoms are reduced . sparing the poultry industry but french and dutch officials remain resolute .
holland 's poultry industry was devastated by an outbreak of a similar virus in 2003 .
after starting in belgium , the virus forced poultry farmers to cull 30 million birds in order to avoid further contamination . " each decision is a weighing of the advantages and the disadvantages , " said johan bongers , a veterinarian at the central institute for animal disease control in lelystad , the netherlands .
" we know what it is to have avian influenza , we know how difficult it is to eradicate it .
that 's why we are in favor of vaccination . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preventative measures are being undertaken in germany bongers admits that the vaccines are not optimal .
but he says improvements are being worked on at the moment .
vaccines have been used effectively in southeast asia - where h5n1 has been wreaking havoc since 2003 - but only as an additional measure to culling . european union regulations at the moment continue to favor culling . once a domesticated bird has been infected , health officials are required to set up a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- buffer zone around the affected farm .
owners of that farm , as well as any other farm with potential for infection are required to kill their poultry stocks . farmers in germany on the northern island of rügen , where the first infected swan was discovered , have already killed 2,500 birds as a precautionary measure . bad times ahead for kliewe 's farm " that is a hard measure maybe , but there should be no hesitation , " said cees vermeeren , of the brussels-based european poultry lobbying organization avec , which does n't recommend vaccination .
" if you hesitate at the beginning , then you have lost the battle . " but culling also means massive economic losses for poultry farmers , something france - ­ the world 's fourth-largest poultry producer - ­ is eager to avoid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : culling could cost the poultry industry tens of millions of euros poultry farmers in northern germany are already feeling the impact .
on sunday , holger kliewe was forced to kill 2,000 of the geese , ducks and chickens he breeds to sell to the tourists who come to his farm and hotel . " i can understand these measures because we have regular visitors , products that we sell from our farm , and we have a restaurant , " said kliewe . but , he added , " our means of production have been taken away completely . "
for a farmer like kliewe , that means a loss of 70 percent of his income .
the other 30 percent , tourism , is taking a hit as well . no alarm , yet " all of us on rügen are suffering from a tarnished image , " kliewe said , adding that guests have already called to cancel their easter vacation reservations .
" the anti-flu measures will convince no one to come to the island in the near future .
that 's why we need this crisis to be contained as soon as possible . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rügen is worried about a tarnished image eu officials remain confident exactly that will happen .
for all the sensational headlines european editorialists have indulged in since the discovery of infected swans -lrb- germany 's bild tabloid splashed " the fear is growing " across its front page on tuesday -rrb- , the virus has yet to make the dangerous jump from wild fowl to domesticated birds . " it will be a problem when the first domesticated poultry are infected , " said uwe truyen , managing director of the institute of animal hygiene and veterinary health at the university of leipzig .
" at the moment , we can still observe cautiously , but calmly . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fear borders on hysteria as bird flu hits europe while european governments are n't hitting the panic button as yet , the spread of bird flu has definitely got a lot of people fearing that the end is nigh .

he said the structure of the german education system fosters inequalities . the investigation was prompted by allegations that school students with immigrant and low-income backgrounds are hugely disadvantaged in primary schools in germany and that they have little chance to obtain academic qualifications . munoz said that it was difficult for outsiders to see through the german school system .
since all of germany 's 16 federal states run their own systems of primary and secondary education , he said that one can not speak of equal opportunities . however , he added children 's rights to education were not violated in germany . " there is no automatic link between the individual achievements of pupils at school and their social background , " he said .
" but here as anywhere else poor people tend to care less about education .
in germany , however , this tendency is further aggravated by the fact that individual selection of specific schools starts very early in life . " oecd study highlights problems munoz pointed to an oecd study in the year 2000 that in his view showed a correlation between the german school system and poor results of its pupils .

munoz said that compared with other countries strikingly few of these children would be able reach academic qualifications . also , stringent school selection procedures , starting at as young an age as eight or nine , foster school careers based on the will of parents rather than pupils ' merits , he said . " i would recommend a careful rethinking of the federal structures in the german school system , " he said .
" they are inhomogeneous and lead to inequalities .

" our education system will change so that all pupils can decide on their school careers at every age , " schavan said .

prison authorities failed twice within 24 hours to find qualified medics to administer the drugs to michael morales in a jail near san francisco .
morales was convicted of the rape and murder of a 17-year-old girl in 1981 .
he is now back on death row while the state reviews its policy on how to carry out lethal injections .
lethal injection is the most widely used method in the us , although some offer inmates the choice of alternatives like electrocution or the gas chamber .
thirty-eight of the 50 us states and the federal government permit capital punishment .
' ethically unacceptable ' morales had been due to die at 0001 on tuesday -lrb- 0801 gmt -rrb- in san quentin prison .
his lawyers had successfully called for anaesthesiologists to be present , arguing that he would suffer extreme pain because of the mix of drugs in the three-part injection .

prison officials then rescheduled the execution for 1930 on tuesday -lrb- 0330 gmt on wednesday -rrb- .
they had planned to use a fatal dose of barbiturate that did not require the presence of the two experts , instead of the three-drug cocktail .
a judge approved the plan , but said the drug had to be administered by a medical professional licensed to inject medications intravenously .
but a spokeswoman for the federal courts said the state had told them it was unable to comply with the order , and the execution had been indefinitely postponed .
review a spokesman for san quentin state prison , vernell crittendon , said morales was relieved at the postponement .
" he smiled , " mr crittendon said .
" he nodded .
he thanked me . "
but the mother of terri witchell , morales ' victim , said she was " totally disillusioned " at the turn of events .
" we 've been waiting 25 years with the expectancy that he is gonna pay for his crimes , " said barbara christian .
" it feels like we just got punched in the stomach . "
the lethal injection process will be reviewed in the coming months to examine concerns it might cause such levels of pain that it would be unconstitutional .
" we are really relieved to see we will now have a careful review of the issues , " said natasha minsker , a lawyer for the american civil liberties union .

" i 'm almost synonymous in the design world of hollywood as the guy who does the academy awards , " he says proudly .
" i grew up as a farm boy in fresno , which is an agricultural town plunked in the middle of california - thousands of miles mentally from hollywood .
" i 'd watch the academy awards and it was such a magical event , i really wanted to be part of that world like everyone does . "
this year marks mr christopher 's 17th assignment as the academy awards production designer .
over the years he has won six emmy awards for his work on oscars sets .
golden days " i 'm humbled and i 'm grateful and i never get tired of doing it .
it 's wonderful , " he says .
it is a job that comes with the awesome responsibility of decking out a stage for the world 's most-watched awards show .
following a miserable year at the us box office , oscars organisers are hoping to reinvigorate the movie-going public by harking back to the golden days of cinema .
" we decided to make it all about going to the movies - the subtext of that statement was , yes , let 's remind people , " says mr christopher . "
last year 's was so high tech , it was my idea to really take a look back " designer roy christopher " to truly appreciate a great film - go and see it in the theatre . "
at the centre of the stage is a huge marquee-style theatre entrance .
" last year 's was so high tech - a lot of technology and video on the floor and video over the audience - it was my idea to really take a look back and we call it ' retro ' with a capital ' r ' . "
the process of designing the set started in the autumn , long before it was known which movies would end up with nominations .
also , at that stage , jon stewart had not been named as the show 's host .
" last year i knew that chris rock was hired early on so that permitted us to be a little edgier for the academy awards - this year we did n't know until later , " mr christopher recalls .
" we thought it was going to be a year of very big movies like king kong , geisha and the producers .
while they 've all done rather well at the box office and in other areas , they did n't emerge as the best picture choices . "
' huge ' experience instead , low-budget films which relatively few people have seen dominate the list of nominations .
" by then we 'd gone down the road of designing this tribute to going to the movies and different movie palaces , " mr christopher says .
" from the movie palace baroque look to streamlined modern to art deco , we 've gone down that road and we realised , like being a kid when we went to the movies , the movies were small but the experience was huge .
" you go into these great theatres and you might see a very intimate movie - so we 're hoping that is still the connection we can make this year . "
of course , times change .
in the digital world many believe that the movie-going experience could indeed become a thing of the past .
also , an often-heard observation from hollywood veterans is that " we just do n't have stars like we used to " .
" having started this in 1979 when we had audrey hepburn , cary grant , laurence olivier , gregory peck - the list goes on and on - who would sit out here and mingle with everybody .
it was a very different experience . "
" the stars from the golden era were very much more comfortable with doing these kinds of shows and they seemed bigger than life . "
while today 's a-list celebrities appear to be shrouded in less movie star mystique , mr christopher believes they are among the most gifted hollywood has ever seen .
" i think we not only have greater stars , we have much finer actors and actresses .
i think we 're in a golden age and i think they 're gorgeous people and i think they 're enormously talented .
" so i think things change , but it 's fine .
as long as people do n't desert the theatres altogether . "

scottish information commissioner kevin dunion said authorities often only released information months late after appeals to his office .
the first information commissioner annual report since the law came into force showed his office received nearly 600 appeals and almost 2,500 inquiries .
mr dunion said public bodies needed to make radical improvements .
nearly one in five appeals involved authorities which had failed to respond to requests for information .
' enthusiastically used ' kevin dunion emphasised that more than half the appeals came from ordinary members of the public .
solicitors and journalists accounted for more than a quarter of appeals .
the scottish executive is carrying out a public consultation on how the freedom of information act is working . "
a third of all appeals to my office are upheld ... there are instances where scottish public authorities should be releasing information and are not " kevin dunion information commissioner mr dunion described the act 's first year as a " great success " .
speaking to bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme , he said : " we did n't know a year ago how many people would ask for information , how authorities would respond , would know how to appeal to my office and we 've had answers to all of those questions .
" tens of thousands of people have made requests , authorities by and large have responded extremely well and i 've received over 570 appeals to my office - far more than i had anticipated but it reflects how the act has been enthusiastically used by the scottish public . "
but he added : " a third of all appeals to my office are upheld entirely so it is quite clear that there are instances where scottish public authorities should be releasing information and are not . "
mr dunion also warned against any changes to the act which would detract from the right to information and more transparency and accountability .
he said : " i appreciate that scottish public authorities had only a short period in which to prepare their organisations for the act coming into force , but the duty to respond within 20 working days is not particularly onerous in most cases .
" i hope to see a radical improvement in this area in 2006 . "

" tens of thousands of people have made requests , authorities by and large have responded extremely well and i 've received over 570 appeals to my office - far more than i had anticipated but it reflects how the act has been enthusiastically used by the scottish public . "
but he added : " a third of all appeals to my office are upheld entirely so it is quite clear that there are instances where scottish public authorities should be releasing information and are not . "
mr dunion also warned against any changes to the act which would detract from the right to information and more transparency and accountability .
he said : " i appreciate that scottish public authorities had only a short period in which to prepare their organisations for the act coming into force , but the duty to respond within 20 working days is not particularly onerous in most cases .
" i hope to see a radical improvement in this area in 2006 . "

mrs mcvey , of kentisbury ford , near barnstaple , has organised a conference this week for the families of victims .

mrs mcvey said no amount of money would ever compensate for the loss of her daughter , but she said a principle was at stake and compensation pay-outs would help prevent mistakes happening again .
the conference , which is being held in exeter on thursday , will allow families to share their experiences and try to find a way forward .

the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- issued the guidance designed to improve the way the nhs deals with the problem .
it is thought as many as 40 % of hospital patients are at risk .
a report published in december estimated that malnutrition costs the nhs £ 7.3bn a year .
effects of malnutrition impaired immune responses reduced muscle strength and fatigue increased difficulties in breathing impaired thermoregulation impaired wound healing apathy , depression and self-neglect poor libido ' i ca n't believe my weight loss ' the report , by the british association for parenteral and enteral nutrition , said this was more than double the annual bill for obesity-related problems .
testing for malnutrition is already mandatory in scotland and nice is calling for the guidelines to be extended to england and wales .
the problem is particularly serious among the elderly .
it is thought more than 10 % of people aged over 65 are malnourished , and as many at 60 % of pensioners who are admitted to hospital .
need for support the nice guidelines were developed in collaboration with the national collaborating centre for acute care .
at risk patient julian o 'connor , 42 , has an auto-immune disease which led to muscle wastage he was at risk of malnutrition after not being able to eat proper food for five weeks , instead relying on a drip fortunately he has now been able to start eating again they recommend all hospital and care home patients should be weighed and measured on admission , and all outpatients should be similarly checked at their first clinic appointment .
checks should be repeated weekly for inpatients , and where there is clinical concern for outpatients , say the guidelines .
nice says specialised nutritional support should be considered for people who are malnourished .
this is defined as : having a body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- of less than 18.5 .
bmi is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in metres squared .
unintentional weight loss greater than 10 % in the last three to six months. a bmi of less than 20 coupled with unintentional weight loss greater than 5 % within the last three to six months .
it also recommends that nutrition support be considered for people at risk of malnutrition - such as those who have eaten little or nothing for more than five days , or who are unable to take in nutrients properly .
all acute hospitals are advised to employ at least one specialist nutrition support nurse .
have your say most people including kitchen staff have little idea about a healthy meal roger w , london send us your comments andrea sutcliffe , who took the lead role in drawing up the guidelines , said they could save the nhs at least £ 45m a year .
malnourished patients stay in hospital for longer , have a higher mortality rate and are three times as likely to develop complications during surgery .
she said : " this guideline should help reassure patients and give confidence to their relatives and carers , that all at-risk patients , no matter where they live or what their underlying condition , will now be screened and if necessary offered appropriate nutritional support . "
' incredibly welcome ' dr mike stroud , of the institute of human nutrition at the university of southampton , also worked on the guidance .
malnutrition of our most vulnerable members of society has been swept under the carpet dr lorna layward , help the aged he said : " ensuring patients receive adequate nutrition is an essential part of basic patient care , yet we know malnutrition is still a big problem for the nhs .
" the guideline contains one obvious and simple message - do not let your patients starve and when you offer them nutrition support , do so by the safest , simplest , most effective route . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley welcomed the guidance .
he said : " far too many patients leave hospital less nourished than when they were admitted .
" patients are often unable to feed themselves effectively because of lack of continuity of care and observation failures . "
dr lorna layward , of the charity help the aged , said the guidelines were " incredibly welcome " .
" our preoccupation with obesity means that malnutrition of our most vulnerable members of society has been swept under the carpet . "
your comments my father-in-law has recently been in hospital in sheffield where he was off food for a little over a week ; subsequently the nurses ensured that he received full nutritional support which extended to his return home , so clearly some hospitals have got the message already .
of course now he has some good yorkshire home cooking to build him up !
giles , london my mother 's aunt was over 90 when admitted to hospital - despite being over 90 , frail and with very poor sight she was left in a ward with 3 other similarly frail ladies .
food was brought to them and about 30 minutes later the plates were collected - in the most part untouched .
whether the food was of a good nutritional value and appetising is neither here nor there as their conditions meant that they could not or would not feed themselves .
in their case , time needed to be spent feeding them - not just leaving it on the tray .
hospitals can penny pinch on the food - which is bad enough but nowhere did i see a nurse or auxiliary try and help the old folk- that would have made the cost of feeding them even greater .
w. stevens , scotland if it is recommended that hospitals should test patients for malnutrition , then they should also look at the food that they are serving their patients .
my father is in hospital at the moment , trying to recover from an infection after having a triple bypass operation .
during his stay in 2 hospitals since christmas , he has had to put up with the hospitals not supplying enough food to go round all the patients on the ward he was on repeatedly , and at a second hospital , being served food that had not been cooked properly and still being cold in the middle .
these situations are the last thing he needs after the problems he has had , and as a result of these and other incidents , he has lost weight during his stay in hospital .
this is also hampering his recovery , as his body is not receiving the nutrients it needs to fight infections and give him enough energy to get up and about again .

food was brought to them and about 30 minutes later the plates were collected - in the most part untouched .
whether the food was of a good nutritional value and appetising is neither here nor there as their conditions meant that they could not or would not feed themselves .

my father is in hospital at the moment , trying to recover from an infection after having a triple bypass operation .

it also recommends that nutrition support be considered for people at risk of malnutrition - such as those who have eaten little or nothing for more than five days , or who are unable to take in nutrients properly .
all acute hospitals are advised to employ at least one specialist nutrition support nurse .
have your say " most people including kitchen staff have little idea about a healthy meal " roger w , london send us your comments andrea sutcliffe , who took the lead role in drawing up the guidelines , said they could save the nhs at least £ 45m a year .
malnourished patients stay in hospital for longer , have a higher mortality rate and are three times as likely to develop complications during surgery .
she said : " this guideline should help reassure patients and give confidence to their relatives and carers , that all at-risk patients , no matter where they live or what their underlying condition , will now be screened and if necessary offered appropriate nutritional support . "
' incredibly welcome ' dr mike stroud , of the institute of human nutrition at the university of southampton , also worked on the guidance . "
malnutrition of our most vulnerable members of society has been swept under the carpet " dr lorna layward , help the aged he said : " ensuring patients receive adequate nutrition is an essential part of basic patient care , yet we know malnutrition is still a big problem for the nhs .
" the guideline contains one obvious and simple message - do not let your patients starve and when you offer them nutrition support , do so by the safest , simplest , most effective route . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley welcomed the guidance .
he said : " far too many patients leave hospital less nourished than when they were admitted .
" patients are often unable to feed themselves effectively because of lack of continuity of care and observation failures . "
dr lorna layward , of the charity help the aged , said the guidelines were " incredibly welcome " .
" our preoccupation with obesity means that malnutrition of our most vulnerable members of society has been swept under the carpet . "
your comments my father-in-law has recently been in hospital in sheffield where he was off food for a little over a week ; subsequently the nurses ensured that he received full nutritional support which extended to his return home , so clearly some hospitals have got the message already .
of course now he has some good yorkshire home cooking to build him up !
giles , london my mother 's aunt was over 90 when admitted to hospital - despite being over 90 , frail and with very poor sight she was left in a ward with 3 other similarly frail ladies .
food was brought to them and about 30 minutes later the plates were collected - in the most part untouched .
whether the food was of a good nutritional value and appetising is neither here nor there as their conditions meant that they could not or would not feed themselves .
in their case , time needed to be spent feeding them - not just leaving it on the tray .
hospitals can penny pinch on the food - which is bad enough but nowhere did i see a nurse or auxiliary try and help the old folk- that would have made the cost of feeding them even greater .
w. stevens , scotland if it is recommended that hospitals should test patients for malnutrition , then they should also look at the food that they are serving their patients .
my father is in hospital at the moment , trying to recover from an infection after having a triple bypass operation .
during his stay in 2 hospitals since christmas , he has had to put up with the hospitals not supplying enough food to go round all the patients on the ward he was on repeatedly , and at a second hospital , being served food that had not been cooked properly and still being cold in the middle .
these situations are the last thing he needs after the problems he has had , and as a result of these and other incidents , he has lost weight during his stay in hospital .
this is also hampering his recovery , as his body is not receiving the nutrients it needs to fight infections and give him enough energy to get up and about again .

from fighting school closures , battling against phone masts or actively cleaning up their streets , we asked people across the uk to tell us their campaigning stories .
here is a selection of their stories .
local pools dry up when liz hughes ' local swimming pool in hackney , london was closed , anger and a sense of injustice drove her to fight for it to be reopened .
soon she realised that hers was n't the only pool under threat , and joined other campaigners to form the london pools campaign .
liz says : " one of the most worrying effects of pool closures is that so many children are n't learning to swim .
it seems ridiculous with the olympics coming , especially when some pools in the olympic zone are threatened . "
read liz 's full story and find out what others are doing to take action on sports facilities britain 's swimming pool sos blot on the landscape susan hopkins never imagined she 'd become a campaigner , but when she learned of plans for 50 metre high pylons in the scottish highlands , she decided to take action .
she is keen to avoid being labelled a ' nimby ' -lsb- not in my back yard -rsb- , saying : " a large part of the economy here depends on tourism from a landscape that is almost unique in not having any tall pylons running through it " .
find out more about this campaign , and what others are doing to tackle energy issues not in our notting hill the friends of portobello are concerned about the influx of large chain stores into the famous london market street .
they want to establish a business conservation area to preserve the area 's unique character and protect independent traders .
tim burke , who runs the group , says : " notting hill has always had a strong political undercurrent ; our campaign is just following the portobello tradition of standing up for itself . "
read tim 's full story and find out how others are fighting back against ' clone towns ' free parking please john brown thinks that the planned introduction of residents ' parking permits in his area is unnecessary and would be like handing a blank chequebook to the council .
he has got together with his neighbours to fight what he sees as a lack of democracy .
john says : " i started this campaign after hearing that the council were going to implement a controlled parking scheme and fast track it without a consultation . "
find out more about this and other transport campaigns dodging demolitions with a history of successful campaigning against house clearance in her lancashire town , sylvia wilson found she was being contacted by people facing demolition and desperate for her help .
she set up a website and a national group to help people fighting for their homes .
sylvia says : " we 're one voice shouting together , instead of lots of little ones in dark corners . "

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- zombie pcs growing quickly online bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- wednesday , 22 february 2006 , 10:10 gmt zombie pcs growing quickly online by mark ward technology correspondent , bbc news website indictments and court cases in the us have once again thrown the spotlight on so-called zombie computers or bots .
in mid-february californian christopher maxwell was charged with creating a network of remotely controlled computers or bots that they put to several uses .
the us alleges that mr maxell and two accomplices netted $ 100,000 by bombarding the owners of compromised computers with pop-up adverts .
the us department of justice alleges that the network of ' bots was also used to shut down computer systems at seattle 's northwest hospital in january 2005 .
in a separate case , in late january jeanson james ancheta pleaded guilty to charges that he set up and controlled tens of thousands of zombie computers that were used to send spam , attack websites and pepper users with pop-up adverts .
mr ancheta made more than $ 61,000 by renting out the bots and by using them to serve up adverts .
mr ancheta is facing up to six years in jail and must pay the us government restitution .
body count statistics gathered by security firm ciphertrust reveal just how bad the problem of botnets is getting .
" every day we are detecting more than 250,000 connecting to the internet and sending mail , " said paul judge , chief technology officer at ciphertrust .
" that 's unique machines that have never done it before , " he said .
" it 's a distribution platform that is becoming more popular for attackers . "
mr judge said the count of new bots had hit 250,000 every day in november 2005 and had stayed at that level ever since .
machines that are part of botnets can be hard to spot , said mr judge , as some only send a few messages per hour .
with tens of thousands of machines in a botnet , that sending rate still adds up to a lot of e-mail .
as numbers have climbed , those behind the botnets have started to specialise , said mr judge .
some people simply create the networks while others hire them out .
others write the spam they are used to send and some administer networks when they are being used to distribute spam , phishing e-mails or messages infected with viruses .
some of them run the net domains associated with spam , phishing or id theft rings that act as drops for any information being fed back .
christopher boyd , security research manager for facetime security labs , said the hiring out of botnets could be a risky business .
he said many people who rent out botnets only do so to try and compromise the network and take control away from its administrator .
regularly , he said , wars were waged online as botnet controllers try to grab more machines for themselves .
machines that are part of one botnet become a target for others because they are demonstrably vulnerable to being taken over , he said .
there were instances of botnet controllers patching up pcs to stop others trying to take the machines over by the same vulnerability .
malicious message most zombies are recruited by viruses and trojans .
some of these backdoors into computers are installed if users visit the wrong website in so-called drive-by downloads but many are e-mailed and rely on naive users opening infected attachments .
guillame lovet , threat response team leader at security firm fortinet , said statistics on the most prevalent viruses of 2005 showed how many were created to recruit bots .
in the first six months of 2005 , said mr lovet , the most active windows viruses were those that scoured the net for vulnerable machines to recruiting into botnets .
the mytob worm first appeared in february 2005 and many variants of it have been created since .
these worms proved hugely successful , he said and prompted a change of tack by the hi-tech criminals .
" once established , those with the botnets go from the building phase to the exploitation phase and start to use them to generate profit . "
botnets were used as hosts for pornographic or illegal material , launch pads for spam and phishing mail messages and some are used to knock websites offline unless a ransom is paid .
mr lovet said there was evidence that a lot of companies hit by botnet attacks that bombard them with data , pay the ransom because it costs so much more to be off the net .
" they do not want to disclose that they paid because it 's not good for business , " he said .
