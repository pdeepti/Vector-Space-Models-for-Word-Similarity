nearly 70 years later , a memorial was dedicated to the " good german " who saved thousands of chinese lives . there is an old saying : " you ca n't go further than china . "
a century ago , the journey from germany took 10 days across the eurasian landmass via the trans-siberian railroad , or it took a month by ship through the suez canal to the eastern port city of shanghai . the 1930s was a time of economic depression at home that helped lead to the rise of adolf hitler . but abroad , germany 's trade with china flourished , and the people there knew little of what was happening in the heart of europe . mercenaries , missionaries or misfits german expatriates who were posted to the far east were largely out of touch with events unfolding in europe and generally fell into one of three categories : mercenaries , missionaries or misfits . john rabe , born 1882 in the northern port city of hamburg , was a combination of all three .
a member of the nazi party in germany , rabe sold turbines and telegraph equipment for siemens , and rose to become the german company 's chief trade representative in the chinese wartime capital of nanking , now called nanjing . his career in china from 1908 to 1938 would have been unremarkable , except for one thing : the meticulous 1,200-page diary he kept that chronicled daily life during a nearly forgotten chapter of the second sino-japanese war . saving lives with a swastika during the japanese occupation , however , rabe did something else that influenced more lives than a journal ever could : he used his nazi credentials to rescue thousands of chinese from certain death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabe documented the nanking massacre when the japanese army , which had already occupied northern china , invaded nanking in 1937 , most westerners fled the besieged city . but rabe and a handful of other foreigners , mainly german , american and british missionaries and doctors , stayed behind . using his influence as a card-carrying member of the national socialist , or nazi party , rabe led an effort to rescue over 250,000 chinese civilians , who would have otherwise perished in a six-week orgy of torture and killing known today as the nanking massacre . " the japanese had pistols and bayonets .
i had only my nazi party symbols and my swastika armband , " rabe wrote in his diary .
chinese officials say that 300,000 were slaughtered in nanjing , a disputed figure that some war historians say is inflated . revered as a " living buddha " in china last week a memorial in nanjing was dedicated to the " good nazi " who was revered as a " living buddha " in china .
known by many americans as the " oskar schindler of china , " rabe has remained virtually unknown in the country of his birth . when rabe returned to germany in 1938 , he gave public lectures about the nanking atrocities , expecting hitler to use his influence with an axis ally .
instead , he was detained by the gestapo . he continued working for siemens in berlin , and was briefly posted to afghanistan .
after the war , he was arrested first by the soviets , then the british , and petitioned to be " de-nazified . " he won the fight against the ideology behind the symbols he used to save lives , but the legal costs had left his family penniless .
when the nanking survivors of his largesse heard about his plight , they sent him care packages .
he died in 1950 of a stroke .
former home is now a museum rabe 's former home in the then international settlement in nanking , which had become a safe haven for the chinese , is now a museum and center for international research , peace and reconciliation .

nearly 70 years later , a memorial was dedicated to the " good german " who saved thousands of chinese lives . there is an old saying : " you ca n't go further than china . "
a century ago , the journey from germany took 10 days across the eurasian landmass via the trans-siberian railroad , or it took a month by ship through the suez canal to the eastern port city of shanghai . the 1930s was a time of economic depression at home that helped lead to the rise of adolf hitler . but abroad , germany 's trade with china flourished , and the people there knew little of what was happening in the heart of europe . mercenaries , missionaries or misfits german expatriates who were posted to the far east were largely out of touch with events unfolding in europe and generally fell into one of three categories : mercenaries , missionaries or misfits . john rabe , born 1882 in the northern port city of hamburg , was a combination of all three .
a member of the nazi party in germany , rabe sold turbines and telegraph equipment for siemens , and rose to become the german company 's chief trade representative in the chinese wartime capital of nanking , now called nanjing . his career in china from 1908 to 1938 would have been unremarkable , except for one thing : the meticulous 1,200-page diary he kept that chronicled daily life during a nearly forgotten chapter of the second sino-japanese war . saving lives with a swastika during the japanese occupation , however , rabe did something else that influenced more lives than a journal ever could : he used his nazi credentials to rescue thousands of chinese from certain death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabe documented the nanking massacre when the japanese army , which had already occupied northern china , invaded nanking in 1937 , most westerners fled the besieged city . but rabe and a handful of other foreigners , mainly german , american and british missionaries and doctors , stayed behind . using his influence as a card-carrying member of the national socialist , or nazi party , rabe led an effort to rescue over 250,000 chinese civilians , who would have otherwise perished in a six-week orgy of torture and killing known today as the nanking massacre . " the japanese had pistols and bayonets .
i had only my nazi party symbols and my swastika armband , " rabe wrote in his diary .

the creators of manga heroes are often as young as their readers - and are , increasingly , young women . here 's a normal scene during a book fair in germany : young people have dressed themselves in colorful , whimsical clothes and layered on the makeup .
they 're engaged in " costume play " to get under the skin of manga heroes and interact with the comic world . the manga scene in germany is more than just a style phenomenon .
the japanese comics are big business .
joachim kaps , from the publisher tokyopop , estimates in 2005 the sales of japanese and korean manga in germany was around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 90 million . -rrb- girl power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga character menolly although the majority of manga comics sold in germany are translations of japanese originals , approximately 20 percent of manga were sketched in germany .
young women 18 to 25 drive the market .
while men traditionally sat behind the drawing table , a wave of female artists have cropped up .
teenage girls regularly participate in competitions organized by publishing houses . although exact numbers do n't exist , the rise of young female manga artists began approximately four years ago . " at previous competitions , more than 90 percent of all contributions were from women , while less than 10 percent were drawn by young men , " said marcus tieschky , an organizer of the comic campus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for a manga drawing competition often , young women draw for a female audience while young men create stories for their male peers .

observers said they hoped the us and europe could start healing widening trans-atlantic rifts . political observers in europe said they were hoping that a decisive advance by democrats in the us election could usher in a new era in trans-atlantic cooperation . many of those who saw us president george w. bush get a bloody nose in these elections expect us lawmakers to take a good hard look at us policy in iraq , first and foremost . " europeans would expect some change in policy and possibly also personnel , " said antonio missiroli , chief political analyst of the european policy centre in brussels .
" it is not to be ruled out that … -lrb- us secretary of defense donald -rrb- rumsfeld might go .
and i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " ' end of a nightmare ' the bush administration was widely seen to have alienated europe and much of the rest of the world by its " with us or against us " approach to iraq , alleged human rights abuses at guantanamo bay prison , and its stance on ecological issues – particularly its refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-us sentiment is openly , and frequently , expressed in europe now , it seems bush 's bill has come due , and europeans are openly happy about it . " there is less white house in america now and a little less america in the world , " dominique moisi , special councillor at the french institute of international relations , told reuters news service . " the demise of -lrb- bush 's -rrb- america is good news for all those who love america , " he added . the socialist group in the european parliament , the second-largest bloc following the conservative grouping , hailed the election result , saying bush had been " seriously weakened . " " we are relieved that we now see the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world , " said martin schulz , the president of the 201-strong socialist group . slow change is likely many analysts did not expect democrats to change things too quickly in iraq , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's tony blair was one of few european leaders to stand behind bush " the democrats will make life unpleasant for bush , but they are not going to get much in his way because they do n't want to be tarred by defeat in iraq , " francois heisbourg , a special councillor at the foundation for strategic research in paris told reuters . trade talks may sour observers also worried that trade negotiations currently underway between the us and the european union could take a hit , post-election . " the democratic congress would probably be marginally more protectionist than the current one and this would not bode well for the current negotiations in the wto framework , considering in particular that the ' fast track ' mandate for the bush administration for striking a deal expires in july 2007 , " the european policy center 's missiroli said . bush 's " fast track " negotiating power allows him to authorize trade deals . even britain is glad but such policy concerns did not dampen broad satisfaction in many european capitals , amid continued growing unhappiness over u.s. leadership . even people in washington 's closest european ally , britain , appeared glad to see bush lose his majority in congress . " he 's not the leader he was .
he does n't seem to be making the decisions , there seems to be no sense to what he is doing anymore , " john hayward , a logistics manager in london , told reuters . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .

the market is expending and the german-born pontifex maximus is jumping on the bandwagon . pope benedict xvi may be a conservative theologian and staunch believer in the catholic dogma , but when it comes to fashion , he is on the cutting edge .
with his penchant for designer sunglasses , padded quilt jackets and exclusive italian footwear , the 79-year-old leader of the catholic church is continuing to attract ecumenical amazement from the world 's leading fashionistas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody can deny that benedict xvi is a man of style what the pope has done to red prada shoes is what the cult us tv series " sex and the city " did to manolo blahniks .
it brought the world of high fashion closer to the common man . if fashion is the new universal language which transcends borders imposed by religion and culture , then papa ratzi - as the former cardinal joseph ratzinger is affectionately called by his adoring fans - is the true herald of sublime color and graceful style .
for a while , gray was the new black .
then black was the new black .
these days - and largely thanks to papal gorgeous footwear - red is the new gray . it should come as no surprise that the time has arrived for an ultimate test of the pope 's celebrity status : an illustrated calendar .
good-bye , sports illustrated !
good-bye victoria 's secret !
hello , vatican uncovered ! a year with the pope the 2007 calendar containing 14 exclusive shots of the 79-year-old roman pontiff and entitled " together - a year with the pope " will appear in italy on nov .
23 together with the catholic weekly famiglia cristiana .
it will cost 5 euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's fashion-conscious swiss guards " this has nothing to do with other calendars , we have our own style and a distinct target , " the magazine 's patrizia brero told dpa .
" our readers would n't have appreciated a calendar featuring television starlets or nude models . " the photographs for this unique glossy calendar were taken over the summer at the pope 's residence in castel gandolfo , south of rome , by photographer giancarlo giuliani .
this is the first time in history that a pope has posed for a photographer . for every copy sold , one euro off the sales price will be donated to a charitable organization for children in rwanda .
the charity was selected by the pope in person . look , ma , it 's a new pope the slogan chosen by famiglia cristiana to sell the calendar - " you 'll see a new pope every day " - remains somewhat puzzling considering that there will be only 14 pictures of the pope in the calendar : one for each month and two on the cover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a 2005 poll , benedict xvi and shakira were the world 's most popular photo personalities how will the faithful manage to see a new pope every day is not exactly clear .
those who are expecting embedded high-tech displays , special effects or simple , old-fashioned miracles may end up having their hopes frustrated . seeing a new pope in the same old picture every day will probably require deep religious commitment or , alternatively , a couple of glasses of chianti or pino grigio . it has become tradition in italy for magazines to offer calendars to their readers this time of the year . the world 's best-known calendar is italian .
published since 1964 , the pirelli calendar usually features naked models or liberally undressed celebrities photographed by some of the world 's most famous photographers . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de of politicians , passports and popes germans are known as serious and hard-working people , but the country 's unruly politicians are habitually letting passions and intrigues run rampant .

the market is expending and the german-born pontifex maximus is jumping on the bandwagon . pope benedict xvi may be a conservative theologian and staunch believer in the catholic dogma , but when it comes to fashion , he is on the cutting edge .
with his penchant for designer sunglasses , padded quilt jackets and exclusive italian footwear , the 79-year-old leader of the catholic church is continuing to attract ecumenical amazement from the world 's leading fashionistas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody can deny that benedict xvi is a man of style what the pope has done to red prada shoes is what the cult us tv series " sex and the city " did to manolo blahniks .
it brought the world of high fashion closer to the common man . if fashion is the new universal language which transcends borders imposed by religion and culture , then papa ratzi - as the former cardinal joseph ratzinger is affectionately called by his adoring fans - is the true herald of sublime color and graceful style .
for a while , gray was the new black .
then black was the new black .
these days - and largely thanks to papal gorgeous footwear - red is the new gray . it should come as no surprise that the time has arrived for an ultimate test of the pope 's celebrity status : an illustrated calendar .
good-bye , sports illustrated !
good-bye victoria 's secret !
hello , vatican uncovered ! a year with the pope the 2007 calendar containing 14 exclusive shots of the 79-year-old roman pontiff and entitled " together - a year with the pope " will appear in italy on nov .
23 together with the catholic weekly famiglia cristiana .
it will cost 5 euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's fashion-conscious swiss guards " this has nothing to do with other calendars , we have our own style and a distinct target , " the magazine 's patrizia brero told dpa .
" our readers would n't have appreciated a calendar featuring television starlets or nude models . " the photographs for this unique glossy calendar were taken over the summer at the pope 's residence in castel gandolfo , south of rome , by photographer giancarlo giuliani .
this is the first time in history that a pope has posed for a photographer . for every copy sold , one euro off the sales price will be donated to a charitable organization for children in rwanda .
the charity was selected by the pope in person . look , ma , it 's a new pope the slogan chosen by famiglia cristiana to sell the calendar - " you 'll see a new pope every day " - remains somewhat puzzling considering that there will be only 14 pictures of the pope in the calendar : one for each month and two on the cover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a 2005 poll , benedict xvi and shakira were the world 's most popular photo personalities how will the faithful manage to see a new pope every day is not exactly clear .
those who are expecting embedded high-tech displays , special effects or simple , old-fashioned miracles may end up having their hopes frustrated . seeing a new pope in the same old picture every day will probably require deep religious commitment or , alternatively , a couple of glasses of chianti or pino grigio . it has become tradition in italy for magazines to offer calendars to their readers this time of the year . the world 's best-known calendar is italian .
published since 1964 , the pirelli calendar usually features naked models or liberally undressed celebrities photographed by some of the world 's most famous photographers . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de of politicians , passports and popes germans are known as serious and hard-working people , but the country 's unruly politicians are habitually letting passions and intrigues run rampant .

nearly 70 years later , a memorial was dedicated to the " good german " who saved thousands of chinese lives . there is an old saying : " you ca n't go further than china . "
a century ago , the journey from germany took 10 days across the eurasian landmass via the trans-siberian railroad , or it took a month by ship through the suez canal to the eastern port city of shanghai . the 1930s was a time of economic depression at home that helped lead to the rise of adolf hitler . but abroad , germany 's trade with china flourished , and the people there knew little of what was happening in the heart of europe . mercenaries , missionaries or misfits german expatriates who were posted to the far east were largely out of touch with events unfolding in europe and generally fell into one of three categories : mercenaries , missionaries or misfits . john rabe , born 1882 in the northern port city of hamburg , was a combination of all three .
a member of the nazi party in germany , rabe sold turbines and telegraph equipment for siemens , and rose to become the german company 's chief trade representative in the chinese wartime capital of nanking , now called nanjing . his career in china from 1908 to 1938 would have been unremarkable , except for one thing : the meticulous 1,200-page diary he kept that chronicled daily life during a nearly forgotten chapter of the second sino-japanese war . saving lives with a swastika during the japanese occupation , however , rabe did something else that influenced more lives than a journal ever could : he used his nazi credentials to rescue thousands of chinese from certain death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabe documented the nanking massacre when the japanese army , which had already occupied northern china , invaded nanking in 1937 , most westerners fled the besieged city . but rabe and a handful of other foreigners , mainly german , american and british missionaries and doctors , stayed behind . using his influence as a card-carrying member of the national socialist , or nazi party , rabe led an effort to rescue over 250,000 chinese civilians , who would have otherwise perished in a six-week orgy of torture and killing known today as the nanking massacre . " the japanese had pistols and bayonets .
i had only my nazi party symbols and my swastika armband , " rabe wrote in his diary .
chinese officials say that 300,000 were slaughtered in nanjing , a disputed figure that some war historians say is inflated . revered as a " living buddha " in china last week a memorial in nanjing was dedicated to the " good nazi " who was revered as a " living buddha " in china .
known by many americans as the " oskar schindler of china , " rabe has remained virtually unknown in the country of his birth . when rabe returned to germany in 1938 , he gave public lectures about the nanking atrocities , expecting hitler to use his influence with an axis ally .
instead , he was detained by the gestapo . he continued working for siemens in berlin , and was briefly posted to afghanistan .
after the war , he was arrested first by the soviets , then the british , and petitioned to be " de-nazified . " he won the fight against the ideology behind the symbols he used to save lives , but the legal costs had left his family penniless .
when the nanking survivors of his largesse heard about his plight , they sent him care packages .
he died in 1950 of a stroke .
former home is now a museum rabe 's former home in the then international settlement in nanking , which had become a safe haven for the chinese , is now a museum and center for international research , peace and reconciliation .

the creators of manga heroes are often as young as their readers - and are , increasingly , young women . here 's a normal scene during a book fair in germany : young people have dressed themselves in colorful , whimsical clothes and layered on the makeup .
they 're engaged in " costume play " to get under the skin of manga heroes and interact with the comic world . the manga scene in germany is more than just a style phenomenon .
the japanese comics are big business .
joachim kaps , from the publisher tokyopop , estimates in 2005 the sales of japanese and korean manga in germany was around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 90 million . -rrb- girl power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga character menolly although the majority of manga comics sold in germany are translations of japanese originals , approximately 20 percent of manga were sketched in germany .
young women 18 to 25 drive the market .
while men traditionally sat behind the drawing table , a wave of female artists have cropped up .
teenage girls regularly participate in competitions organized by publishing houses . although exact numbers do n't exist , the rise of young female manga artists began approximately four years ago . " at previous competitions , more than 90 percent of all contributions were from women , while less than 10 percent were drawn by young men , " said marcus tieschky , an organizer of the comic campus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for a manga drawing competition often , young women draw for a female audience while young men create stories for their male peers . " that 's just the way it is , that young women know best what young women want to read , " said 20-year-old artist natalie wormsbecher .
" but people should n't oversimplify . " there are also exceptions , wormsbecher said , even in the german scene .
detta zimmermann , for example , draws adventure history most often read by men , and is very successful . self styled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga figure by anike hage approximately half of the comics drawn by girls have topics from everyday life -lrb- school , friendships or love -rrb- and the other half from fantasy themes -lrb- like angels and demons . -rrb-
with boys , the fantasy themes -lrb- especially technology and science fiction -rrb- outweigh everything else , tieschky said .
the manga scene in germany has more thematic variety than the original japanese comics . " the japanese artists and their work have had paramount influence on -lrb- german -rrb- artists , " said christina gossel , from the tokyopop publishing house .
" but with many -lrb- artists -rrb- , one increasingly sees that with more experience and practice , they are developing their own style . " christina plaka , anike hage and detta zimmermann are three examples , gossel said . franco-belgian , chinese and korean influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga comic by natalie wormsbecher most manga artists get their first drawing itch after exposure to japanese manga .
young artists copy the japanese style .
but later , inspirations from other sources get added . " i do n't have any specific model .
formerly , i was fascinated with satoshi urushihara and often tried to copy that style .
now , i am inspired by various artists , not only manga ones , " said berliner marie sann . the largest influences on german artists come from japanese manga , south korean manhwa and chinese manhua , tieschky said .
novels and films and franco-belgian comics also provide inspiration .
while european comics play a role in the german manga world , traditional us-style comics are rarely present . finding an audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a figure by marie sann the large comics publishers control more than 70 percent of the manga comics sold in stores .
yet there are other options for aspiring artists .
when one of the big three manga publishing firms - tokyopop , carlsen and egmont manga & anime -lrb- ema -rrb- - passes on an artist , there 's always the internet , fanzines and small publishers . the german manga phenomenon 's influence has crossed beyond the world of comics and into popular culture .
it can be seen in videos and magazines which stamp manga as a style choice for 12 to 25 year olds .
merchandizing becomes an additional source of income for the mangakas , as young manga female artists are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga artist anike hage anike hage , author of the popular gothic sports , said she sees the developments in manga as largely positive . " i 'm a little worried when one has to draw for free , because there are so many young artists that demand no or very little money for their work , but always deliver better quality .
i find it good that there are always more fans drawing , because it keeps -lrb- manga -rrb- moving .

german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " i think the united states is going to become more protectionist and we will see less approval for international trade agreements , " scherpenberg said .
this could make the world trade organization 's doha round negotiations more difficult , he said . but whether the issues are economic or political , guérot said it had become clear to both sides that everyone had to work together . " europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .
but he said the german parliament would increasingly seek contact to the house , in particular to new congressmen and women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt is the foreign ministry 's transatlantic expert experts agreed that it was important to seek a dialogue to new representatives , in particular as many of them were lacking international experience . " this is an opportunity to develop a new relationship , " voigt said . guérot said european delegations should travel to the united states and us representatives be invited to europe . " what we need to do now is reach out , " she said .
" this way , we can better convey european positions on major international issues and make concerted efforts to find constructive political solutions for the future . " europe will see the united states with new eyes most europeans were crossing their fingers for the democrats in this campaign .
although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states . " the perception of the united states in europe has so far been shaped by the republicans and the american president , " voigt said .
" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said .

german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " i think the united states is going to become more protectionist and we will see less approval for international trade agreements , " scherpenberg said .
this could make the world trade organization 's doha round negotiations more difficult , he said . but whether the issues are economic or political , guérot said it had become clear to both sides that everyone had to work together . " europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .
but he said the german parliament would increasingly seek contact to the house , in particular to new congressmen and women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt is the foreign ministry 's transatlantic expert experts agreed that it was important to seek a dialogue to new representatives , in particular as many of them were lacking international experience . " this is an opportunity to develop a new relationship , " voigt said . guérot said european delegations should travel to the united states and us representatives be invited to europe . " what we need to do now is reach out , " she said .
" this way , we can better convey european positions on major international issues and make concerted efforts to find constructive political solutions for the future . " europe will see the united states with new eyes most europeans were crossing their fingers for the democrats in this campaign .
although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states . " the perception of the united states in europe has so far been shaped by the republicans and the american president , " voigt said .
" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said .

nearly 70 years later , a memorial was dedicated to the " good german " who saved thousands of chinese lives . there is an old saying : " you ca n't go further than china . "
a century ago , the journey from germany took 10 days across the eurasian landmass via the trans-siberian railroad , or it took a month by ship through the suez canal to the eastern port city of shanghai . the 1930s was a time of economic depression at home that helped lead to the rise of adolf hitler . but abroad , germany 's trade with china flourished , and the people there knew little of what was happening in the heart of europe . mercenaries , missionaries or misfits german expatriates who were posted to the far east were largely out of touch with events unfolding in europe and generally fell into one of three categories : mercenaries , missionaries or misfits . john rabe , born 1882 in the northern port city of hamburg , was a combination of all three .
a member of the nazi party in germany , rabe sold turbines and telegraph equipment for siemens , and rose to become the german company 's chief trade representative in the chinese wartime capital of nanking , now called nanjing . his career in china from 1908 to 1938 would have been unremarkable , except for one thing : the meticulous 1,200-page diary he kept that chronicled daily life during a nearly forgotten chapter of the second sino-japanese war . saving lives with a swastika during the japanese occupation , however , rabe did something else that influenced more lives than a journal ever could : he used his nazi credentials to rescue thousands of chinese from certain death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabe documented the nanking massacre when the japanese army , which had already occupied northern china , invaded nanking in 1937 , most westerners fled the besieged city . but rabe and a handful of other foreigners , mainly german , american and british missionaries and doctors , stayed behind . using his influence as a card-carrying member of the national socialist , or nazi party , rabe led an effort to rescue over 250,000 chinese civilians , who would have otherwise perished in a six-week orgy of torture and killing known today as the nanking massacre . " the japanese had pistols and bayonets .
i had only my nazi party symbols and my swastika armband , " rabe wrote in his diary .
chinese officials say that 300,000 were slaughtered in nanjing , a disputed figure that some war historians say is inflated . revered as a " living buddha " in china last week a memorial in nanjing was dedicated to the " good nazi " who was revered as a " living buddha " in china .
known by many americans as the " oskar schindler of china , " rabe has remained virtually unknown in the country of his birth . when rabe returned to germany in 1938 , he gave public lectures about the nanking atrocities , expecting hitler to use his influence with an axis ally .
instead , he was detained by the gestapo . he continued working for siemens in berlin , and was briefly posted to afghanistan .
after the war , he was arrested first by the soviets , then the british , and petitioned to be " de-nazified . " he won the fight against the ideology behind the symbols he used to save lives , but the legal costs had left his family penniless .
when the nanking survivors of his largesse heard about his plight , they sent him care packages .
he died in 1950 of a stroke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 08.11.2006 eu to criticize turkey but will keep door open großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cultural differences will have to be overcome for turkey to join the eu turkey will likely be allowed to continue the accession process after a key eu report is published on wednesday .
but the bloc is also expected to take aim at what it sees as insufficient reform in a number of areas . according to initial reports about the content of the report , the eu will continue to encourage turkey in its bid for accession .
however , it will also take ankara to task for the pace with which it is implementing mandatory reforms .
cyprus , already an eu member , remains a nagging issue .
turkey , which claims the divided island as a part of its national territory , has been reluctant to agree to any moves that could imply any recognition by ankara of cypriot sovereignty .
the report also focuses on the slowing pace of turkish reforms in general .
it calls for further efforts to strengthen rights for religious and ethnic minorities , women and trade unions .
it urges ankara to assert civilian control over the military .
and it criticizes a turkish law against " insulting turkishness , " which the eu says impinges on turkish citizens ' freedom of expression .
the port plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are trying to find a compromise on cyprus eu officials said that european commission president jose manuel barroso is determined to give turkey a chance to institute the necessary reforms .
but in the face of many europeans ' growing scepticism toward ankara 's bid , significant progress will have to be made before eu leaders meet in mid-december to decide whether the accession process should continue .
finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has reportedly drafted a plan aimed at bringing some movement on the issue of cyprus .
the details are being kept secret at present , but the plan allegedly calls upon turkey to open its ports to ships from cyprus - in accordance with the eu customs union . turkey agreed in 2005 to extend its customs agreements with the original 15 members of the eu to all of the bloc 's newer members , including cyprus .
but thus far , it has kept its ports and airports closed to cypriot ships and planes . turkish failure to yield on this issue could lead to a suspension of membership talks . germany in the hot seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants turkish prime minister recep erdogan to take a new direction turkey 's bid for eu membership could become a major political headache for germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel . she will be expected to make progress on the issue when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
but merkel herself is sceptical about turkey 's suitability for the bloc , and members of her own grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats are divided along party lines . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , called for membership negotiations to be suspended .
" the major deficits in the human rights situation in turkey , " said stoiber , " as well as the crass breach of contract toward cyprus as an eu member state have to elicit consequences .
we ca n't pretend nothing has happened . " german social democrats , who supported turkey 's bid for accession under former chancellor gerhard schröder , were quick to reject stoiber 's demands .

but the bloc is also expected to take aim at what it sees as insufficient reform in a number of areas . according to initial reports about the content of the report , the eu will continue to encourage turkey in its bid for accession .
however , it will also take ankara to task for the pace with which it is implementing mandatory reforms .
cyprus , already an eu member , remains a nagging issue .
turkey , which claims the divided island as a part of its national territory , has been reluctant to agree to any moves that could imply any recognition by ankara of cypriot sovereignty .
the report also focuses on the slowing pace of turkish reforms in general .
it calls for further efforts to strengthen rights for religious and ethnic minorities , women and trade unions .
it urges ankara to assert civilian control over the military .
and it criticizes a turkish law against " insulting turkishness , " which the eu says impinges on turkish citizens ' freedom of expression .
the port plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are trying to find a compromise on cyprus eu officials said that european commission president jose manuel barroso is determined to give turkey a chance to institute the necessary reforms .
but in the face of many europeans ' growing scepticism toward ankara 's bid , significant progress will have to be made before eu leaders meet in mid-december to decide whether the accession process should continue .
finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has reportedly drafted a plan aimed at bringing some movement on the issue of cyprus .
the details are being kept secret at present , but the plan allegedly calls upon turkey to open its ports to ships from cyprus - in accordance with the eu customs union . turkey agreed in 2005 to extend its customs agreements with the original 15 members of the eu to all of the bloc 's newer members , including cyprus .
but thus far , it has kept its ports and airports closed to cypriot ships and planes . turkish failure to yield on this issue could lead to a suspension of membership talks . germany in the hot seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants turkish prime minister recep erdogan to take a new direction turkey 's bid for eu membership could become a major political headache for germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel . she will be expected to make progress on the issue when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
but merkel herself is sceptical about turkey 's suitability for the bloc , and members of her own grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats are divided along party lines . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , called for membership negotiations to be suspended .
" the major deficits in the human rights situation in turkey , " said stoiber , " as well as the crass breach of contract toward cyprus as an eu member state have to elicit consequences .
we ca n't pretend nothing has happened . " german social democrats , who supported turkey 's bid for accession under former chancellor gerhard schröder , were quick to reject stoiber 's demands .

other issues important to europeans - such as broader middle east policy , trade , and environmental issues - are also likely to be affected by us political change , observers said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nancy pelosi will be the first woman to be elected house speaker pelosi , who is now set to become the first woman in history to be elected house speaker , said mid-term election results proved that the american people felt it was time for a change .
the influential san francisco liberal is already on record as calling for a phased withdrawal of us troops from iraq and indicated she would continue to campaign for a pullout . pelosi voted against the 2002 resolution authorizing the use of force in iraq . " today the american people voted for change and they voted for democrats to take our country in a new direction , " pelosi said .
" and that is exactly what we intend to do . " europeans expected to welcome democratic advance pelosi 's words are likely to assure many european leaders , particularly germany and france who were vocal opponents of the war in iraq .

other issues important to europeans - such as broader middle east policy , trade , and environmental issues - are also likely to be affected by us political change , observers said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nancy pelosi will be the first woman to be elected house speaker pelosi , who is now set to become the first woman in history to be elected house speaker , said mid-term election results proved that the american people felt it was time for a change .
the influential san francisco liberal is already on record as calling for a phased withdrawal of us troops from iraq and indicated she would continue to campaign for a pullout . pelosi voted against the 2002 resolution authorizing the use of force in iraq . " today the american people voted for change and they voted for democrats to take our country in a new direction , " pelosi said .
" and that is exactly what we intend to do . " europeans expected to welcome democratic advance pelosi 's words are likely to assure many european leaders , particularly germany and france who were vocal opponents of the war in iraq .
even in countries that traditionally supported the bush administration on the iraq war , the mood has palpably changed in recent months as the chaos and bloodshed in iraq has taken a turn for the worse . europeans will be also be hoping that a decisive advance by democrats in the us election could usher in a new era in transatlantic cooperation . " many in europe would like to see bush get a bloody nose in these elections and view the democrats as closer to the european way of thinking , " mark leonard , a foreign policy analyst at the london-based center for european reform told the daily international herald tribune . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenegger bucked the anti-republican trend antonio missiroli , chief political analyst of the european policy center in brussels , added that speculation on the departure of us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld will likely increase , as he will be made a " scapegoat " for the iraq debacle . " europeans would expect some change in policy , and possibly also personnel . ... i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face -lrb- as defense secretary -rrb- , and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " democrats also gained six gubernatorial seats in to take the majority of state houses for the first time in 12 years , us media reported . former hollywood action star arnold schwarzenegger bucked the anti-republican trend and was re-elected governor of california , helped to victory by his pro-environment stance .
but democrats picked up governorships in six other states from republicans , scoring wins in the previously republican-held states of arkansas , colorado , maryland , massachusetts , new york and ohio , according to projections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton says america has voted for change thus , european policy analyst missiroli said , a main effect of the election may not come from the democrats at all , but from members of president bush 's own party . " my impression is that -lrb- on environmental issues , -rrb- the midterm elections will matter more for the gubernatorial races than for congress , " missoli said .
schwarzenegger 's victory " might mean it is still possible for a republican political leader to do an environment friendly policy , and therefore this could have consequences over the next months and years in american policy at large . " us votes for change the race for seats in the upper house of congress , the senate , were still being counted in virginia and montana , several hours after the close of voting .
whether the senate will be ruled by democrats or republicans is still unclear . but an upbeat hillary clinton said america had voted for change , after she was reelected to the senate tuesday .
she told her supporters that new york and the country wanted a new beginning . the former first lady , who easily secured reelection and is widely expected to run for the presidency in 2008 , told campaigners at her acceptance speech that she was prepared to " roll up my sleeves and get to work . " flanked by husband and former president bill clinton , she pointed to the wide picture of democrat gains , with control of both the senate and house of representatives in the opposition party 's sights . " this is a big night for democrats , is n't it ? ...

they 're engaged in " costume play " to get under the skin of manga heroes and interact with the comic world . the manga scene in germany is more than just a style phenomenon .

the creators of manga heroes are often as young as their readers - and are , increasingly , young women . here 's a normal scene during a book fair in germany : young people have dressed themselves in colorful , whimsical clothes and layered on the makeup .

while men traditionally sat behind the drawing table , a wave of female artists have cropped up .
teenage girls regularly participate in competitions organized by publishing houses . although exact numbers do n't exist , the rise of young female manga artists began approximately four years ago . " at previous competitions , more than 90 percent of all contributions were from women , while less than 10 percent were drawn by young men , " said marcus tieschky , an organizer of the comic campus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for a manga drawing competition often , young women draw for a female audience while young men create stories for their male peers . " that 's just the way it is , that young women know best what young women want to read , " said 20-year-old artist natalie wormsbecher .

a decision by us mail group fedex to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 super-jumbo planes caused massive third-quarter losses at airbus parent eads .
still , airbus expressed confidence in the embattled project . european aircraft maker airbus said tuesday it regretted the decision of us mail group fedex corp. to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 planes but expressed confidence in its beleaguered superjumbo project . production of the a380 - the world 's biggest civilian airliner , which is available as a passenger and cargo plane - has been beset by difficulties .

a decision by us mail group fedex to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 super-jumbo planes caused massive third-quarter losses at airbus parent eads .
still , airbus expressed confidence in the embattled project . european aircraft maker airbus said tuesday it regretted the decision of us mail group fedex corp. to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 planes but expressed confidence in its beleaguered superjumbo project . production of the a380 - the world 's biggest civilian airliner , which is available as a passenger and cargo plane - has been beset by difficulties .
deliveries are running two years behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once on land , fedex packages are delivered by truck " we regret the decision by fedex but we understand that they had an urgent need for the means to continue their expansion , " said a spokeswoman for airbus . " we think that the a380 freighter will be an excellent plane for the 21st century offering the best performances to its clients , " she added . fedex turns to boeing on wednesday , airbus parent eads said it reported a net loss in the third quarter , a reverse from a profit a year earlier .
its earnings were hammered by the troubled commercial airplanes division , notably the behind-schedule a380 program , and a weak us dollar , the european aeronautic defence and space co. said .
it lost 195 million euros -lrb- $ 245 million -rrb- in july-september , from a net profit of euro279 million euros in the year-earlier quarter . on tuesday , fedex express , a unit of fedex , said it had pulled out of an order for 10 freighter versions of the european superjumbo " after airbus announced significant delays in delivery of the a380 . " instead , fedex express said it was buying 15 boeing 777 freighter planes with options to purchase another 15 . airbus has orders for 15 other a380 cargo planes , five from us plane leasing group ilfc and 10 from ups , the us-based rival for fedex . restructuring plan over the past months airbus has repeatedly cited persistent manufacturing problems as the reason for delays .

no further information was available on which suppliers would be dropped or the timetable for the cuts , she said . airbus ' comment confirmed a report in the german financial times deutschland newspaper monday that airbus planned to cut procurement costs by 350 million euros by 2010 ; the report - which cited the employee magazine of airbus parent eads - said the amount of components produced in low-wage countries is to rise by 50 percent . help for suppliers ? meanwhile , the german government may come to the aid of sub-contractors caught out by the airbus crisis , according to two german newsweeklies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus is undertaking a restructuring in response to delivery problems der spiegel and wirtschaftswoche said hans-joachim gante , who heads an industry group , bdli , had written to suppliers during the week saying financial aid was possible if companies were in dire straits or on the verge of bankruptcy . they said the circular had been suggested by the german government , and called for the companies to state the financial impact that the airbus problems had had on them .
gante said the government was " willing to work with us on a solution .

german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " i think the united states is going to become more protectionist and we will see less approval for international trade agreements , " scherpenberg said .
this could make the world trade organization 's doha round negotiations more difficult , he said . but whether the issues are economic or political , guérot said it had become clear to both sides that everyone had to work together . " europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .
but he said the german parliament would increasingly seek contact to the house , in particular to new congressmen and women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt is the foreign ministry 's transatlantic expert experts agreed that it was important to seek a dialogue to new representatives , in particular as many of them were lacking international experience . " this is an opportunity to develop a new relationship , " voigt said . guérot said european delegations should travel to the united states and us representatives be invited to europe . " what we need to do now is reach out , " she said .
" this way , we can better convey european positions on major international issues and make concerted efforts to find constructive political solutions for the future . " europe will see the united states with new eyes most europeans were crossing their fingers for the democrats in this campaign .
although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states . " the perception of the united states in europe has so far been shaped by the republicans and the american president , " voigt said .
" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said .

while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " i think the united states is going to become more protectionist and we will see less approval for international trade agreements , " scherpenberg said .
this could make the world trade organization 's doha round negotiations more difficult , he said . but whether the issues are economic or political , guérot said it had become clear to both sides that everyone had to work together . " europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .
but he said the german parliament would increasingly seek contact to the house , in particular to new congressmen and women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt is the foreign ministry 's transatlantic expert experts agreed that it was important to seek a dialogue to new representatives , in particular as many of them were lacking international experience . " this is an opportunity to develop a new relationship , " voigt said . guérot said european delegations should travel to the united states and us representatives be invited to europe . " what we need to do now is reach out , " she said .
" this way , we can better convey european positions on major international issues and make concerted efforts to find constructive political solutions for the future . " europe will see the united states with new eyes most europeans were crossing their fingers for the democrats in this campaign .
although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states . " the perception of the united states in europe has so far been shaped by the republicans and the american president , " voigt said .
" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said . " if europe perceives that the united states are striving to take on a new tone and a new direction , then public opinion here will turn positive , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .

the market is expending and the german-born pontifex maximus is jumping on the bandwagon . pope benedict xvi may be a conservative theologian and staunch believer in the catholic dogma , but when it comes to fashion , he is on the cutting edge .
with his penchant for designer sunglasses , padded quilt jackets and exclusive italian footwear , the 79-year-old leader of the catholic church is continuing to attract ecumenical amazement from the world 's leading fashionistas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody can deny that benedict xvi is a man of style what the pope has done to red prada shoes is what the cult us tv series " sex and the city " did to manolo blahniks .
it brought the world of high fashion closer to the common man . if fashion is the new universal language which transcends borders imposed by religion and culture , then papa ratzi - as the former cardinal joseph ratzinger is affectionately called by his adoring fans - is the true herald of sublime color and graceful style .
for a while , gray was the new black .
then black was the new black .
these days - and largely thanks to papal gorgeous footwear - red is the new gray . it should come as no surprise that the time has arrived for an ultimate test of the pope 's celebrity status : an illustrated calendar .
good-bye , sports illustrated !
good-bye victoria 's secret !
hello , vatican uncovered ! a year with the pope the 2007 calendar containing 14 exclusive shots of the 79-year-old roman pontiff and entitled " together - a year with the pope " will appear in italy on nov .
23 together with the catholic weekly famiglia cristiana .
it will cost 5 euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's fashion-conscious swiss guards " this has nothing to do with other calendars , we have our own style and a distinct target , " the magazine 's patrizia brero told dpa .
" our readers would n't have appreciated a calendar featuring television starlets or nude models . " the photographs for this unique glossy calendar were taken over the summer at the pope 's residence in castel gandolfo , south of rome , by photographer giancarlo giuliani .
this is the first time in history that a pope has posed for a photographer . for every copy sold , one euro off the sales price will be donated to a charitable organization for children in rwanda .
the charity was selected by the pope in person . look , ma , it 's a new pope the slogan chosen by famiglia cristiana to sell the calendar - " you 'll see a new pope every day " - remains somewhat puzzling considering that there will be only 14 pictures of the pope in the calendar : one for each month and two on the cover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a 2005 poll , benedict xvi and shakira were the world 's most popular photo personalities how will the faithful manage to see a new pope every day is not exactly clear .
those who are expecting embedded high-tech displays , special effects or simple , old-fashioned miracles may end up having their hopes frustrated . seeing a new pope in the same old picture every day will probably require deep religious commitment or , alternatively , a couple of glasses of chianti or pino grigio . it has become tradition in italy for magazines to offer calendars to their readers this time of the year . the world 's best-known calendar is italian .
published since 1964 , the pirelli calendar usually features naked models or liberally undressed celebrities photographed by some of the world 's most famous photographers . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de of politicians , passports and popes germans are known as serious and hard-working people , but the country 's unruly politicians are habitually letting passions and intrigues run rampant .

nearly 70 years later , a memorial was dedicated to the " good german " who saved thousands of chinese lives . there is an old saying : " you ca n't go further than china . "
a century ago , the journey from germany took 10 days across the eurasian landmass via the trans-siberian railroad , or it took a month by ship through the suez canal to the eastern port city of shanghai . the 1930s was a time of economic depression at home that helped lead to the rise of adolf hitler . but abroad , germany 's trade with china flourished , and the people there knew little of what was happening in the heart of europe . mercenaries , missionaries or misfits german expatriates who were posted to the far east were largely out of touch with events unfolding in europe and generally fell into one of three categories : mercenaries , missionaries or misfits . john rabe , born 1882 in the northern port city of hamburg , was a combination of all three .

known by many americans as the " oskar schindler of china , " rabe has remained virtually unknown in the country of his birth . when rabe returned to germany in 1938 , he gave public lectures about the nanking atrocities , expecting hitler to use his influence with an axis ally .
instead , he was detained by the gestapo . he continued working for siemens in berlin , and was briefly posted to afghanistan .
after the war , he was arrested first by the soviets , then the british , and petitioned to be " de-nazified . " he won the fight against the ideology behind the symbols he used to save lives , but the legal costs had left his family penniless .

nearly 70 years later , a memorial was dedicated to the " good german " who saved thousands of chinese lives . there is an old saying : " you ca n't go further than china . "
a century ago , the journey from germany took 10 days across the eurasian landmass via the trans-siberian railroad , or it took a month by ship through the suez canal to the eastern port city of shanghai . the 1930s was a time of economic depression at home that helped lead to the rise of adolf hitler . but abroad , germany 's trade with china flourished , and the people there knew little of what was happening in the heart of europe . mercenaries , missionaries or misfits german expatriates who were posted to the far east were largely out of touch with events unfolding in europe and generally fell into one of three categories : mercenaries , missionaries or misfits . john rabe , born 1882 in the northern port city of hamburg , was a combination of all three .
a member of the nazi party in germany , rabe sold turbines and telegraph equipment for siemens , and rose to become the german company 's chief trade representative in the chinese wartime capital of nanking , now called nanjing . his career in china from 1908 to 1938 would have been unremarkable , except for one thing : the meticulous 1,200-page diary he kept that chronicled daily life during a nearly forgotten chapter of the second sino-japanese war . saving lives with a swastika during the japanese occupation , however , rabe did something else that influenced more lives than a journal ever could : he used his nazi credentials to rescue thousands of chinese from certain death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabe documented the nanking massacre when the japanese army , which had already occupied northern china , invaded nanking in 1937 , most westerners fled the besieged city . but rabe and a handful of other foreigners , mainly german , american and british missionaries and doctors , stayed behind . using his influence as a card-carrying member of the national socialist , or nazi party , rabe led an effort to rescue over 250,000 chinese civilians , who would have otherwise perished in a six-week orgy of torture and killing known today as the nanking massacre . " the japanese had pistols and bayonets .
i had only my nazi party symbols and my swastika armband , " rabe wrote in his diary .
chinese officials say that 300,000 were slaughtered in nanjing , a disputed figure that some war historians say is inflated . revered as a " living buddha " in china last week a memorial in nanjing was dedicated to the " good nazi " who was revered as a " living buddha " in china .
known by many americans as the " oskar schindler of china , " rabe has remained virtually unknown in the country of his birth . when rabe returned to germany in 1938 , he gave public lectures about the nanking atrocities , expecting hitler to use his influence with an axis ally .
instead , he was detained by the gestapo . he continued working for siemens in berlin , and was briefly posted to afghanistan .
after the war , he was arrested first by the soviets , then the british , and petitioned to be " de-nazified . " he won the fight against the ideology behind the symbols he used to save lives , but the legal costs had left his family penniless .
when the nanking survivors of his largesse heard about his plight , they sent him care packages .
he died in 1950 of a stroke .
former home is now a museum rabe 's former home in the then international settlement in nanking , which had become a safe haven for the chinese , is now a museum and center for international research , peace and reconciliation .

observers said they hoped the us and europe could start healing widening trans-atlantic rifts . political observers in europe said they were hoping that a decisive advance by democrats in the us election could usher in a new era in trans-atlantic cooperation . many of those who saw us president george w. bush get a bloody nose in these elections expect us lawmakers to take a good hard look at us policy in iraq , first and foremost . " europeans would expect some change in policy and possibly also personnel , " said antonio missiroli , chief political analyst of the european policy centre in brussels .
" it is not to be ruled out that … -lrb- us secretary of defense donald -rrb- rumsfeld might go .
and i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " ' end of a nightmare ' the bush administration was widely seen to have alienated europe and much of the rest of the world by its " with us or against us " approach to iraq , alleged human rights abuses at guantanamo bay prison , and its stance on ecological issues – particularly its refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-us sentiment is openly , and frequently , expressed in europe now , it seems bush 's bill has come due , and europeans are openly happy about it . " there is less white house in america now and a little less america in the world , " dominique moisi , special councillor at the french institute of international relations , told reuters news service . " the demise of -lrb- bush 's -rrb- america is good news for all those who love america , " he added . the socialist group in the european parliament , the second-largest bloc following the conservative grouping , hailed the election result , saying bush had been " seriously weakened . " " we are relieved that we now see the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world , " said martin schulz , the president of the 201-strong socialist group . slow change is likely many analysts did not expect democrats to change things too quickly in iraq , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's tony blair was one of few european leaders to stand behind bush " the democrats will make life unpleasant for bush , but they are not going to get much in his way because they do n't want to be tarred by defeat in iraq , " francois heisbourg , a special councillor at the foundation for strategic research in paris told reuters . trade talks may sour observers also worried that trade negotiations currently underway between the us and the european union could take a hit , post-election . " the democratic congress would probably be marginally more protectionist than the current one and this would not bode well for the current negotiations in the wto framework , considering in particular that the ' fast track ' mandate for the bush administration for striking a deal expires in july 2007 , " the european policy center 's missiroli said . bush 's " fast track " negotiating power allows him to authorize trade deals . even britain is glad but such policy concerns did not dampen broad satisfaction in many european capitals , amid continued growing unhappiness over u.s. leadership . even people in washington 's closest european ally , britain , appeared glad to see bush lose his majority in congress . " he 's not the leader he was .
he does n't seem to be making the decisions , there seems to be no sense to what he is doing anymore , " john hayward , a logistics manager in london , told reuters . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .

other issues important to europeans - such as broader middle east policy , trade , and environmental issues - are also likely to be affected by us political change , observers said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nancy pelosi will be the first woman to be elected house speaker pelosi , who is now set to become the first woman in history to be elected house speaker , said mid-term election results proved that the american people felt it was time for a change .
the influential san francisco liberal is already on record as calling for a phased withdrawal of us troops from iraq and indicated she would continue to campaign for a pullout . pelosi voted against the 2002 resolution authorizing the use of force in iraq . " today the american people voted for change and they voted for democrats to take our country in a new direction , " pelosi said .
" and that is exactly what we intend to do . " europeans expected to welcome democratic advance pelosi 's words are likely to assure many european leaders , particularly germany and france who were vocal opponents of the war in iraq .
even in countries that traditionally supported the bush administration on the iraq war , the mood has palpably changed in recent months as the chaos and bloodshed in iraq has taken a turn for the worse . europeans will be also be hoping that a decisive advance by democrats in the us election could usher in a new era in transatlantic cooperation . " many in europe would like to see bush get a bloody nose in these elections and view the democrats as closer to the european way of thinking , " mark leonard , a foreign policy analyst at the london-based center for european reform told the daily international herald tribune . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenegger bucked the anti-republican trend antonio missiroli , chief political analyst of the european policy center in brussels , added that speculation on the departure of us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld will likely increase , as he will be made a " scapegoat " for the iraq debacle . " europeans would expect some change in policy , and possibly also personnel . ... i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face -lrb- as defense secretary -rrb- , and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " democrats also gained six gubernatorial seats in to take the majority of state houses for the first time in 12 years , us media reported . former hollywood action star arnold schwarzenegger bucked the anti-republican trend and was re-elected governor of california , helped to victory by his pro-environment stance .
but democrats picked up governorships in six other states from republicans , scoring wins in the previously republican-held states of arkansas , colorado , maryland , massachusetts , new york and ohio , according to projections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton says america has voted for change thus , european policy analyst missiroli said , a main effect of the election may not come from the democrats at all , but from members of president bush 's own party . " my impression is that -lrb- on environmental issues , -rrb- the midterm elections will matter more for the gubernatorial races than for congress , " missoli said .
schwarzenegger 's victory " might mean it is still possible for a republican political leader to do an environment friendly policy , and therefore this could have consequences over the next months and years in american policy at large . " us votes for change the race for seats in the upper house of congress , the senate , were still being counted in virginia and montana , several hours after the close of voting .
whether the senate will be ruled by democrats or republicans is still unclear . but an upbeat hillary clinton said america had voted for change , after she was reelected to the senate tuesday .
she told her supporters that new york and the country wanted a new beginning . the former first lady , who easily secured reelection and is widely expected to run for the presidency in 2008 , told campaigners at her acceptance speech that she was prepared to " roll up my sleeves and get to work . " flanked by husband and former president bill clinton , she pointed to the wide picture of democrat gains , with control of both the senate and house of representatives in the opposition party 's sights . " this is a big night for democrats , is n't it ? ...

the creators of manga heroes are often as young as their readers - and are , increasingly , young women . here 's a normal scene during a book fair in germany : young people have dressed themselves in colorful , whimsical clothes and layered on the makeup .
they 're engaged in " costume play " to get under the skin of manga heroes and interact with the comic world . the manga scene in germany is more than just a style phenomenon .
the japanese comics are big business .
joachim kaps , from the publisher tokyopop , estimates in 2005 the sales of japanese and korean manga in germany was around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 90 million . -rrb- girl power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga character menolly although the majority of manga comics sold in germany are translations of japanese originals , approximately 20 percent of manga were sketched in germany .
young women 18 to 25 drive the market .
while men traditionally sat behind the drawing table , a wave of female artists have cropped up .
teenage girls regularly participate in competitions organized by publishing houses . although exact numbers do n't exist , the rise of young female manga artists began approximately four years ago . " at previous competitions , more than 90 percent of all contributions were from women , while less than 10 percent were drawn by young men , " said marcus tieschky , an organizer of the comic campus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for a manga drawing competition often , young women draw for a female audience while young men create stories for their male peers . " that 's just the way it is , that young women know best what young women want to read , " said 20-year-old artist natalie wormsbecher .
" but people should n't oversimplify . " there are also exceptions , wormsbecher said , even in the german scene .
detta zimmermann , for example , draws adventure history most often read by men , and is very successful . self styled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga figure by anike hage approximately half of the comics drawn by girls have topics from everyday life -lrb- school , friendships or love -rrb- and the other half from fantasy themes -lrb- like angels and demons . -rrb-
with boys , the fantasy themes -lrb- especially technology and science fiction -rrb- outweigh everything else , tieschky said .
the manga scene in germany has more thematic variety than the original japanese comics . " the japanese artists and their work have had paramount influence on -lrb- german -rrb- artists , " said christina gossel , from the tokyopop publishing house .
" but with many -lrb- artists -rrb- , one increasingly sees that with more experience and practice , they are developing their own style . " christina plaka , anike hage and detta zimmermann are three examples , gossel said . franco-belgian , chinese and korean influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga comic by natalie wormsbecher most manga artists get their first drawing itch after exposure to japanese manga .
young artists copy the japanese style .
but later , inspirations from other sources get added . " i do n't have any specific model .
formerly , i was fascinated with satoshi urushihara and often tried to copy that style .
now , i am inspired by various artists , not only manga ones , " said berliner marie sann . the largest influences on german artists come from japanese manga , south korean manhwa and chinese manhua , tieschky said .
novels and films and franco-belgian comics also provide inspiration .
while european comics play a role in the german manga world , traditional us-style comics are rarely present . finding an audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a figure by marie sann the large comics publishers control more than 70 percent of the manga comics sold in stores .
yet there are other options for aspiring artists .
when one of the big three manga publishing firms - tokyopop , carlsen and egmont manga & anime -lrb- ema -rrb- - passes on an artist , there 's always the internet , fanzines and small publishers . the german manga phenomenon 's influence has crossed beyond the world of comics and into popular culture .
it can be seen in videos and magazines which stamp manga as a style choice for 12 to 25 year olds .
merchandizing becomes an additional source of income for the mangakas , as young manga female artists are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga artist anike hage anike hage , author of the popular gothic sports , said she sees the developments in manga as largely positive . " i 'm a little worried when one has to draw for free , because there are so many young artists that demand no or very little money for their work , but always deliver better quality .
i find it good that there are always more fans drawing , because it keeps -lrb- manga -rrb- moving .

a decision by us mail group fedex to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 super-jumbo planes caused massive third-quarter losses at airbus parent eads .
still , airbus expressed confidence in the embattled project . european aircraft maker airbus said tuesday it regretted the decision of us mail group fedex corp. to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 planes but expressed confidence in its beleaguered superjumbo project . production of the a380 - the world 's biggest civilian airliner , which is available as a passenger and cargo plane - has been beset by difficulties .
deliveries are running two years behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once on land , fedex packages are delivered by truck " we regret the decision by fedex but we understand that they had an urgent need for the means to continue their expansion , " said a spokeswoman for airbus . " we think that the a380 freighter will be an excellent plane for the 21st century offering the best performances to its clients , " she added . fedex turns to boeing on wednesday , airbus parent eads said it reported a net loss in the third quarter , a reverse from a profit a year earlier .
its earnings were hammered by the troubled commercial airplanes division , notably the behind-schedule a380 program , and a weak us dollar , the european aeronautic defence and space co. said .
it lost 195 million euros -lrb- $ 245 million -rrb- in july-september , from a net profit of euro279 million euros in the year-earlier quarter . on tuesday , fedex express , a unit of fedex , said it had pulled out of an order for 10 freighter versions of the european superjumbo " after airbus announced significant delays in delivery of the a380 . " instead , fedex express said it was buying 15 boeing 777 freighter planes with options to purchase another 15 . airbus has orders for 15 other a380 cargo planes , five from us plane leasing group ilfc and 10 from ups , the us-based rival for fedex . restructuring plan over the past months airbus has repeatedly cited persistent manufacturing problems as the reason for delays .
in response to these problems , the company has announced plans to restructure , cutting the number of its suppliers by more than 80 percent , a spokeswoman confirmed earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantas got some : an airbus a380 passes over sydney harbour the number of suppliers will be reduced " from 3,000 to 500 , " airbus spokeswoman marcella muratore told ap news service .
no further information was available on which suppliers would be dropped or the timetable for the cuts , she said . airbus ' comment confirmed a report in the german financial times deutschland newspaper monday that airbus planned to cut procurement costs by 350 million euros by 2010 ; the report - which cited the employee magazine of airbus parent eads - said the amount of components produced in low-wage countries is to rise by 50 percent . help for suppliers ? meanwhile , the german government may come to the aid of sub-contractors caught out by the airbus crisis , according to two german newsweeklies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus is undertaking a restructuring in response to delivery problems der spiegel and wirtschaftswoche said hans-joachim gante , who heads an industry group , bdli , had written to suppliers during the week saying financial aid was possible if companies were in dire straits or on the verge of bankruptcy . they said the circular had been suggested by the german government , and called for the companies to state the financial impact that the airbus problems had had on them .
gante said the government was " willing to work with us on a solution . " airbus has told customers that the double-decker passenger jets , which have nearly completed certification , will be delivered up to two years late , mainly because engineers must learn to use new production software . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany undecided on role in eads in the minefield of national egos at the heart of eads , the german government seems undecided about how best to shore up its interests without being left to foot the bill if the aerospace giant 's finances deteriorate .

the market is expending and the german-born pontifex maximus is jumping on the bandwagon . pope benedict xvi may be a conservative theologian and staunch believer in the catholic dogma , but when it comes to fashion , he is on the cutting edge .
with his penchant for designer sunglasses , padded quilt jackets and exclusive italian footwear , the 79-year-old leader of the catholic church is continuing to attract ecumenical amazement from the world 's leading fashionistas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody can deny that benedict xvi is a man of style what the pope has done to red prada shoes is what the cult us tv series " sex and the city " did to manolo blahniks .
it brought the world of high fashion closer to the common man . if fashion is the new universal language which transcends borders imposed by religion and culture , then papa ratzi - as the former cardinal joseph ratzinger is affectionately called by his adoring fans - is the true herald of sublime color and graceful style .
for a while , gray was the new black .
then black was the new black .
these days - and largely thanks to papal gorgeous footwear - red is the new gray . it should come as no surprise that the time has arrived for an ultimate test of the pope 's celebrity status : an illustrated calendar .
good-bye , sports illustrated !
good-bye victoria 's secret !
hello , vatican uncovered ! a year with the pope the 2007 calendar containing 14 exclusive shots of the 79-year-old roman pontiff and entitled " together - a year with the pope " will appear in italy on nov .
23 together with the catholic weekly famiglia cristiana .
it will cost 5 euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's fashion-conscious swiss guards " this has nothing to do with other calendars , we have our own style and a distinct target , " the magazine 's patrizia brero told dpa .
" our readers would n't have appreciated a calendar featuring television starlets or nude models . " the photographs for this unique glossy calendar were taken over the summer at the pope 's residence in castel gandolfo , south of rome , by photographer giancarlo giuliani .
this is the first time in history that a pope has posed for a photographer . for every copy sold , one euro off the sales price will be donated to a charitable organization for children in rwanda .
the charity was selected by the pope in person . look , ma , it 's a new pope the slogan chosen by famiglia cristiana to sell the calendar - " you 'll see a new pope every day " - remains somewhat puzzling considering that there will be only 14 pictures of the pope in the calendar : one for each month and two on the cover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a 2005 poll , benedict xvi and shakira were the world 's most popular photo personalities how will the faithful manage to see a new pope every day is not exactly clear .
those who are expecting embedded high-tech displays , special effects or simple , old-fashioned miracles may end up having their hopes frustrated . seeing a new pope in the same old picture every day will probably require deep religious commitment or , alternatively , a couple of glasses of chianti or pino grigio . it has become tradition in italy for magazines to offer calendars to their readers this time of the year . the world 's best-known calendar is italian .
published since 1964 , the pirelli calendar usually features naked models or liberally undressed celebrities photographed by some of the world 's most famous photographers . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de of politicians , passports and popes germans are known as serious and hard-working people , but the country 's unruly politicians are habitually letting passions and intrigues run rampant .

" many in europe would like to see bush get a bloody nose in these elections and view the democrats as closer to the european way of thinking , " mark leonard , a foreign policy analyst at the london-based center for european reform told the daily international herald tribune . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenegger bucked the anti-republican trend antonio missiroli , chief political analyst of the european policy center in brussels , added that speculation on the departure of us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld will likely increase , as he will be made a " scapegoat " for the iraq debacle . " europeans would expect some change in policy , and possibly also personnel . ... i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face -lrb- as defense secretary -rrb- , and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " democrats also gained six gubernatorial seats in to take the majority of state houses for the first time in 12 years , us media reported . former hollywood action star arnold schwarzenegger bucked the anti-republican trend and was re-elected governor of california , helped to victory by his pro-environment stance .
but democrats picked up governorships in six other states from republicans , scoring wins in the previously republican-held states of arkansas , colorado , maryland , massachusetts , new york and ohio , according to projections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton says america has voted for change thus , european policy analyst missiroli said , a main effect of the election may not come from the democrats at all , but from members of president bush 's own party . " my impression is that -lrb- on environmental issues , -rrb- the midterm elections will matter more for the gubernatorial races than for congress , " missoli said .
schwarzenegger 's victory " might mean it is still possible for a republican political leader to do an environment friendly policy , and therefore this could have consequences over the next months and years in american policy at large . " us votes for change the race for seats in the upper house of congress , the senate , were still being counted in virginia and montana , several hours after the close of voting .
whether the senate will be ruled by democrats or republicans is still unclear . but an upbeat hillary clinton said america had voted for change , after she was reelected to the senate tuesday .
she told her supporters that new york and the country wanted a new beginning . the former first lady , who easily secured reelection and is widely expected to run for the presidency in 2008 , told campaigners at her acceptance speech that she was prepared to " roll up my sleeves and get to work . " flanked by husband and former president bill clinton , she pointed to the wide picture of democrat gains , with control of both the senate and house of representatives in the opposition party 's sights .

observers said they hoped the us and europe could start healing widening trans-atlantic rifts . political observers in europe said they were hoping that a decisive advance by democrats in the us election could usher in a new era in trans-atlantic cooperation . many of those who saw us president george w. bush get a bloody nose in these elections expect us lawmakers to take a good hard look at us policy in iraq , first and foremost . " europeans would expect some change in policy and possibly also personnel , " said antonio missiroli , chief political analyst of the european policy centre in brussels .
" it is not to be ruled out that … -lrb- us secretary of defense donald -rrb- rumsfeld might go .
and i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " ' end of a nightmare ' the bush administration was widely seen to have alienated europe and much of the rest of the world by its " with us or against us " approach to iraq , alleged human rights abuses at guantanamo bay prison , and its stance on ecological issues – particularly its refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-us sentiment is openly , and frequently , expressed in europe now , it seems bush 's bill has come due , and europeans are openly happy about it . " there is less white house in america now and a little less america in the world , " dominique moisi , special councillor at the french institute of international relations , told reuters news service . " the demise of -lrb- bush 's -rrb- america is good news for all those who love america , " he added . the socialist group in the european parliament , the second-largest bloc following the conservative grouping , hailed the election result , saying bush had been " seriously weakened . " " we are relieved that we now see the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world , " said martin schulz , the president of the 201-strong socialist group . slow change is likely many analysts did not expect democrats to change things too quickly in iraq , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's tony blair was one of few european leaders to stand behind bush " the democrats will make life unpleasant for bush , but they are not going to get much in his way because they do n't want to be tarred by defeat in iraq , " francois heisbourg , a special councillor at the foundation for strategic research in paris told reuters . trade talks may sour observers also worried that trade negotiations currently underway between the us and the european union could take a hit , post-election . " the democratic congress would probably be marginally more protectionist than the current one and this would not bode well for the current negotiations in the wto framework , considering in particular that the ' fast track ' mandate for the bush administration for striking a deal expires in july 2007 , " the european policy center 's missiroli said . bush 's " fast track " negotiating power allows him to authorize trade deals . even britain is glad but such policy concerns did not dampen broad satisfaction in many european capitals , amid continued growing unhappiness over u.s. leadership . even people in washington 's closest european ally , britain , appeared glad to see bush lose his majority in congress . " he 's not the leader he was .
he does n't seem to be making the decisions , there seems to be no sense to what he is doing anymore , " john hayward , a logistics manager in london , told reuters . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .

" our readers would n't have appreciated a calendar featuring television starlets or nude models . " the photographs for this unique glossy calendar were taken over the summer at the pope 's residence in castel gandolfo , south of rome , by photographer giancarlo giuliani .

the charity was selected by the pope in person . look , ma , it 's a new pope the slogan chosen by famiglia cristiana to sell the calendar - " you 'll see a new pope every day " - remains somewhat puzzling considering that there will be only 14 pictures of the pope in the calendar : one for each month and two on the cover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a 2005 poll , benedict xvi and shakira were the world 's most popular photo personalities how will the faithful manage to see a new pope every day is not exactly clear .
those who are expecting embedded high-tech displays , special effects or simple , old-fashioned miracles may end up having their hopes frustrated . seeing a new pope in the same old picture every day will probably require deep religious commitment or , alternatively , a couple of glasses of chianti or pino grigio . it has become tradition in italy for magazines to offer calendars to their readers this time of the year . the world 's best-known calendar is italian .

it will cost 5 euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's fashion-conscious swiss guards " this has nothing to do with other calendars , we have our own style and a distinct target , " the magazine 's patrizia brero told dpa .
" our readers would n't have appreciated a calendar featuring television starlets or nude models . " the photographs for this unique glossy calendar were taken over the summer at the pope 's residence in castel gandolfo , south of rome , by photographer giancarlo giuliani .
this is the first time in history that a pope has posed for a photographer . for every copy sold , one euro off the sales price will be donated to a charitable organization for children in rwanda .
the charity was selected by the pope in person . look , ma , it 's a new pope the slogan chosen by famiglia cristiana to sell the calendar - " you 'll see a new pope every day " - remains somewhat puzzling considering that there will be only 14 pictures of the pope in the calendar : one for each month and two on the cover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a 2005 poll , benedict xvi and shakira were the world 's most popular photo personalities how will the faithful manage to see a new pope every day is not exactly clear .
those who are expecting embedded high-tech displays , special effects or simple , old-fashioned miracles may end up having their hopes frustrated . seeing a new pope in the same old picture every day will probably require deep religious commitment or , alternatively , a couple of glasses of chianti or pino grigio . it has become tradition in italy for magazines to offer calendars to their readers this time of the year . the world 's best-known calendar is italian .
published since 1964 , the pirelli calendar usually features naked models or liberally undressed celebrities photographed by some of the world 's most famous photographers . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de of politicians , passports and popes germans are known as serious and hard-working people , but the country 's unruly politicians are habitually letting passions and intrigues run rampant .

but the bloc is also expected to take aim at what it sees as insufficient reform in a number of areas . according to initial reports about the content of the report , the eu will continue to encourage turkey in its bid for accession .
however , it will also take ankara to task for the pace with which it is implementing mandatory reforms .
cyprus , already an eu member , remains a nagging issue .
turkey , which claims the divided island as a part of its national territory , has been reluctant to agree to any moves that could imply any recognition by ankara of cypriot sovereignty .
the report also focuses on the slowing pace of turkish reforms in general .
it calls for further efforts to strengthen rights for religious and ethnic minorities , women and trade unions .
it urges ankara to assert civilian control over the military .
and it criticizes a turkish law against " insulting turkishness , " which the eu says impinges on turkish citizens ' freedom of expression .
the port plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are trying to find a compromise on cyprus eu officials said that european commission president jose manuel barroso is determined to give turkey a chance to institute the necessary reforms .
but in the face of many europeans ' growing scepticism toward ankara 's bid , significant progress will have to be made before eu leaders meet in mid-december to decide whether the accession process should continue .
finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has reportedly drafted a plan aimed at bringing some movement on the issue of cyprus .
the details are being kept secret at present , but the plan allegedly calls upon turkey to open its ports to ships from cyprus - in accordance with the eu customs union . turkey agreed in 2005 to extend its customs agreements with the original 15 members of the eu to all of the bloc 's newer members , including cyprus .
but thus far , it has kept its ports and airports closed to cypriot ships and planes . turkish failure to yield on this issue could lead to a suspension of membership talks . germany in the hot seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants turkish prime minister recep erdogan to take a new direction turkey 's bid for eu membership could become a major political headache for germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel . she will be expected to make progress on the issue when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
but merkel herself is sceptical about turkey 's suitability for the bloc , and members of her own grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats are divided along party lines . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , called for membership negotiations to be suspended .
" the major deficits in the human rights situation in turkey , " said stoiber , " as well as the crass breach of contract toward cyprus as an eu member state have to elicit consequences .
we ca n't pretend nothing has happened . " german social democrats , who supported turkey 's bid for accession under former chancellor gerhard schröder , were quick to reject stoiber 's demands .
germany 's social democrat foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , warned against inflaming the situation .
germany , steinmeier said , " had every interest in not escalating the conflict here . " turkish compromise on cyprus would take the heat off the eu and merkel .
but although turkish prime minister recep erdogan has expressed willingness to push through further legal reforms in his country , there is no telling whether he would be willing - or politically able - to back down on an issue to which turkey has historically attached so much national pride . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopeful of defusing looming crisis with turkey as positions over continuing accession talks with ankara harden , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was confident a solution could be found to turkey 's dispute with cyprus by the end of the year .

but the bloc is also expected to take aim at what it sees as insufficient reform in a number of areas . according to initial reports about the content of the report , the eu will continue to encourage turkey in its bid for accession .
however , it will also take ankara to task for the pace with which it is implementing mandatory reforms .
cyprus , already an eu member , remains a nagging issue .
turkey , which claims the divided island as a part of its national territory , has been reluctant to agree to any moves that could imply any recognition by ankara of cypriot sovereignty .
the report also focuses on the slowing pace of turkish reforms in general .
it calls for further efforts to strengthen rights for religious and ethnic minorities , women and trade unions .
it urges ankara to assert civilian control over the military .
and it criticizes a turkish law against " insulting turkishness , " which the eu says impinges on turkish citizens ' freedom of expression .
the port plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are trying to find a compromise on cyprus eu officials said that european commission president jose manuel barroso is determined to give turkey a chance to institute the necessary reforms .
but in the face of many europeans ' growing scepticism toward ankara 's bid , significant progress will have to be made before eu leaders meet in mid-december to decide whether the accession process should continue .
finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has reportedly drafted a plan aimed at bringing some movement on the issue of cyprus .
the details are being kept secret at present , but the plan allegedly calls upon turkey to open its ports to ships from cyprus - in accordance with the eu customs union . turkey agreed in 2005 to extend its customs agreements with the original 15 members of the eu to all of the bloc 's newer members , including cyprus .
but thus far , it has kept its ports and airports closed to cypriot ships and planes . turkish failure to yield on this issue could lead to a suspension of membership talks . germany in the hot seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants turkish prime minister recep erdogan to take a new direction turkey 's bid for eu membership could become a major political headache for germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel . she will be expected to make progress on the issue when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
but merkel herself is sceptical about turkey 's suitability for the bloc , and members of her own grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats are divided along party lines . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , called for membership negotiations to be suspended .
" the major deficits in the human rights situation in turkey , " said stoiber , " as well as the crass breach of contract toward cyprus as an eu member state have to elicit consequences .
we ca n't pretend nothing has happened . " german social democrats , who supported turkey 's bid for accession under former chancellor gerhard schröder , were quick to reject stoiber 's demands .
germany 's social democrat foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , warned against inflaming the situation .
germany , steinmeier said , " had every interest in not escalating the conflict here . " turkish compromise on cyprus would take the heat off the eu and merkel .
but although turkish prime minister recep erdogan has expressed willingness to push through further legal reforms in his country , there is no telling whether he would be willing - or politically able - to back down on an issue to which turkey has historically attached so much national pride . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopeful of defusing looming crisis with turkey as positions over continuing accession talks with ankara harden , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was confident a solution could be found to turkey 's dispute with cyprus by the end of the year .

the surprise announcement came in the middle of pischetsrieder 's plan to cut costs and jobs at the german car group . the 58-year-old volkswagen ceo will leave the wolfsburg-based company without seeing through his drastic restructuring program .
the plan called for cutting as many as 20,000 jobs and introducing longer industry working hours . the departure comes as a surprise , since pischetsrieder 's contract was recently extended another five years .
but there was already speculation over his tenure this spring .
since then , the relationship between pischetsrieder and chairman ferdinand piech had become increasingly tense . piech brought pischetsrieder to volkwagen in 2000 from bmw , but is now one of his biggest critics . pischetsrieder and piech clashed over plans for volkswagen to take part in a deal in the trucking industry .
german truck maker man , which is 20-percent owned by vw , has made a takeover over bid for swedish rival scania but vw is pushing for a three-way alliance between the companies . restructuring unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen is considering cutting 20,000 jobs reactions among the workforce to pischetrieder 's exit is mixed .
the restructuring moves were unpopular , but volkswagen 's earnings had begun to improve .
it posted a 77 percent rise in net profit and stronger sales for the first nine months of the year , despite the high restructuring costs . and guido reinking , industry analyst with automobil woche , said there were no reasons for mr pischetsrieder to step aside . " they are gaining market share in europe and they are gaining market share in the usa , " reinking told dw-radio .
" the american market is getting better now for vw , so globally they are on a good track , so there is no figure in the quarterly figures which says pischetsrieder did not do a good job . ” vw said its board of directors has recommended that martin winterkorn , 59 , take over from pischetsrieder jan.1.
winterkorn is currently ceo of audi , also part of the volkswagen group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw wants to raise earnings the state of lower saxony is the second biggest shareholder in vw .

nearly 70 years later , a memorial was dedicated to the " good german " who saved thousands of chinese lives . there is an old saying : " you ca n't go further than china . "
a century ago , the journey from germany took 10 days across the eurasian landmass via the trans-siberian railroad , or it took a month by ship through the suez canal to the eastern port city of shanghai . the 1930s was a time of economic depression at home that helped lead to the rise of adolf hitler . but abroad , germany 's trade with china flourished , and the people there knew little of what was happening in the heart of europe . mercenaries , missionaries or misfits german expatriates who were posted to the far east were largely out of touch with events unfolding in europe and generally fell into one of three categories : mercenaries , missionaries or misfits . john rabe , born 1882 in the northern port city of hamburg , was a combination of all three .
a member of the nazi party in germany , rabe sold turbines and telegraph equipment for siemens , and rose to become the german company 's chief trade representative in the chinese wartime capital of nanking , now called nanjing . his career in china from 1908 to 1938 would have been unremarkable , except for one thing : the meticulous 1,200-page diary he kept that chronicled daily life during a nearly forgotten chapter of the second sino-japanese war . saving lives with a swastika during the japanese occupation , however , rabe did something else that influenced more lives than a journal ever could : he used his nazi credentials to rescue thousands of chinese from certain death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabe documented the nanking massacre when the japanese army , which had already occupied northern china , invaded nanking in 1937 , most westerners fled the besieged city . but rabe and a handful of other foreigners , mainly german , american and british missionaries and doctors , stayed behind . using his influence as a card-carrying member of the national socialist , or nazi party , rabe led an effort to rescue over 250,000 chinese civilians , who would have otherwise perished in a six-week orgy of torture and killing known today as the nanking massacre . " the japanese had pistols and bayonets .
i had only my nazi party symbols and my swastika armband , " rabe wrote in his diary .
chinese officials say that 300,000 were slaughtered in nanjing , a disputed figure that some war historians say is inflated . revered as a " living buddha " in china last week a memorial in nanjing was dedicated to the " good nazi " who was revered as a " living buddha " in china .
known by many americans as the " oskar schindler of china , " rabe has remained virtually unknown in the country of his birth . when rabe returned to germany in 1938 , he gave public lectures about the nanking atrocities , expecting hitler to use his influence with an axis ally .
instead , he was detained by the gestapo . he continued working for siemens in berlin , and was briefly posted to afghanistan .
after the war , he was arrested first by the soviets , then the british , and petitioned to be " de-nazified . " he won the fight against the ideology behind the symbols he used to save lives , but the legal costs had left his family penniless .
when the nanking survivors of his largesse heard about his plight , they sent him care packages .

nearly 70 years later , a memorial was dedicated to the " good german " who saved thousands of chinese lives . there is an old saying : " you ca n't go further than china . "
a century ago , the journey from germany took 10 days across the eurasian landmass via the trans-siberian railroad , or it took a month by ship through the suez canal to the eastern port city of shanghai . the 1930s was a time of economic depression at home that helped lead to the rise of adolf hitler . but abroad , germany 's trade with china flourished , and the people there knew little of what was happening in the heart of europe . mercenaries , missionaries or misfits german expatriates who were posted to the far east were largely out of touch with events unfolding in europe and generally fell into one of three categories : mercenaries , missionaries or misfits . john rabe , born 1882 in the northern port city of hamburg , was a combination of all three .
a member of the nazi party in germany , rabe sold turbines and telegraph equipment for siemens , and rose to become the german company 's chief trade representative in the chinese wartime capital of nanking , now called nanjing . his career in china from 1908 to 1938 would have been unremarkable , except for one thing : the meticulous 1,200-page diary he kept that chronicled daily life during a nearly forgotten chapter of the second sino-japanese war . saving lives with a swastika during the japanese occupation , however , rabe did something else that influenced more lives than a journal ever could : he used his nazi credentials to rescue thousands of chinese from certain death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabe documented the nanking massacre when the japanese army , which had already occupied northern china , invaded nanking in 1937 , most westerners fled the besieged city . but rabe and a handful of other foreigners , mainly german , american and british missionaries and doctors , stayed behind . using his influence as a card-carrying member of the national socialist , or nazi party , rabe led an effort to rescue over 250,000 chinese civilians , who would have otherwise perished in a six-week orgy of torture and killing known today as the nanking massacre . " the japanese had pistols and bayonets .
i had only my nazi party symbols and my swastika armband , " rabe wrote in his diary .
chinese officials say that 300,000 were slaughtered in nanjing , a disputed figure that some war historians say is inflated . revered as a " living buddha " in china last week a memorial in nanjing was dedicated to the " good nazi " who was revered as a " living buddha " in china .
known by many americans as the " oskar schindler of china , " rabe has remained virtually unknown in the country of his birth . when rabe returned to germany in 1938 , he gave public lectures about the nanking atrocities , expecting hitler to use his influence with an axis ally .
instead , he was detained by the gestapo . he continued working for siemens in berlin , and was briefly posted to afghanistan .
after the war , he was arrested first by the soviets , then the british , and petitioned to be " de-nazified . " he won the fight against the ideology behind the symbols he used to save lives , but the legal costs had left his family penniless .
when the nanking survivors of his largesse heard about his plight , they sent him care packages .
he died in 1950 of a stroke .
former home is now a museum rabe 's former home in the then international settlement in nanking , which had become a safe haven for the chinese , is now a museum and center for international research , peace and reconciliation .

but the bloc is also expected to take aim at what it sees as insufficient reform in a number of areas . according to initial reports about the content of the report , the eu will continue to encourage turkey in its bid for accession .
however , it will also take ankara to task for the pace with which it is implementing mandatory reforms .
cyprus , already an eu member , remains a nagging issue .
turkey , which claims the divided island as a part of its national territory , has been reluctant to agree to any moves that could imply any recognition by ankara of cypriot sovereignty .
the report also focuses on the slowing pace of turkish reforms in general .
it calls for further efforts to strengthen rights for religious and ethnic minorities , women and trade unions .
it urges ankara to assert civilian control over the military .
and it criticizes a turkish law against " insulting turkishness , " which the eu says impinges on turkish citizens ' freedom of expression .
the port plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are trying to find a compromise on cyprus eu officials said that european commission president jose manuel barroso is determined to give turkey a chance to institute the necessary reforms .
but in the face of many europeans ' growing scepticism toward ankara 's bid , significant progress will have to be made before eu leaders meet in mid-december to decide whether the accession process should continue .
finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has reportedly drafted a plan aimed at bringing some movement on the issue of cyprus .
the details are being kept secret at present , but the plan allegedly calls upon turkey to open its ports to ships from cyprus - in accordance with the eu customs union . turkey agreed in 2005 to extend its customs agreements with the original 15 members of the eu to all of the bloc 's newer members , including cyprus .
but thus far , it has kept its ports and airports closed to cypriot ships and planes . turkish failure to yield on this issue could lead to a suspension of membership talks . germany in the hot seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants turkish prime minister recep erdogan to take a new direction turkey 's bid for eu membership could become a major political headache for germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel . she will be expected to make progress on the issue when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
but merkel herself is sceptical about turkey 's suitability for the bloc , and members of her own grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats are divided along party lines . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , called for membership negotiations to be suspended .
" the major deficits in the human rights situation in turkey , " said stoiber , " as well as the crass breach of contract toward cyprus as an eu member state have to elicit consequences .
we ca n't pretend nothing has happened . " german social democrats , who supported turkey 's bid for accession under former chancellor gerhard schröder , were quick to reject stoiber 's demands .
germany 's social democrat foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , warned against inflaming the situation .
germany , steinmeier said , " had every interest in not escalating the conflict here . " turkish compromise on cyprus would take the heat off the eu and merkel .
but although turkish prime minister recep erdogan has expressed willingness to push through further legal reforms in his country , there is no telling whether he would be willing - or politically able - to back down on an issue to which turkey has historically attached so much national pride . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopeful of defusing looming crisis with turkey as positions over continuing accession talks with ankara harden , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was confident a solution could be found to turkey 's dispute with cyprus by the end of the year .

it calls for further efforts to strengthen rights for religious and ethnic minorities , women and trade unions .
it urges ankara to assert civilian control over the military .
and it criticizes a turkish law against " insulting turkishness , " which the eu says impinges on turkish citizens ' freedom of expression .
the port plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are trying to find a compromise on cyprus eu officials said that european commission president jose manuel barroso is determined to give turkey a chance to institute the necessary reforms .
but in the face of many europeans ' growing scepticism toward ankara 's bid , significant progress will have to be made before eu leaders meet in mid-december to decide whether the accession process should continue .
finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has reportedly drafted a plan aimed at bringing some movement on the issue of cyprus .
the details are being kept secret at present , but the plan allegedly calls upon turkey to open its ports to ships from cyprus - in accordance with the eu customs union . turkey agreed in 2005 to extend its customs agreements with the original 15 members of the eu to all of the bloc 's newer members , including cyprus .
but thus far , it has kept its ports and airports closed to cypriot ships and planes . turkish failure to yield on this issue could lead to a suspension of membership talks . germany in the hot seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants turkish prime minister recep erdogan to take a new direction turkey 's bid for eu membership could become a major political headache for germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel . she will be expected to make progress on the issue when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
but merkel herself is sceptical about turkey 's suitability for the bloc , and members of her own grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats are divided along party lines . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , called for membership negotiations to be suspended .
" the major deficits in the human rights situation in turkey , " said stoiber , " as well as the crass breach of contract toward cyprus as an eu member state have to elicit consequences .
we ca n't pretend nothing has happened . " german social democrats , who supported turkey 's bid for accession under former chancellor gerhard schröder , were quick to reject stoiber 's demands .
germany 's social democrat foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , warned against inflaming the situation .
germany , steinmeier said , " had every interest in not escalating the conflict here . " turkish compromise on cyprus would take the heat off the eu and merkel .
but although turkish prime minister recep erdogan has expressed willingness to push through further legal reforms in his country , there is no telling whether he would be willing - or politically able - to back down on an issue to which turkey has historically attached so much national pride . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopeful of defusing looming crisis with turkey as positions over continuing accession talks with ankara harden , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was confident a solution could be found to turkey 's dispute with cyprus by the end of the year .

other issues important to europeans - such as broader middle east policy , trade , and environmental issues - are also likely to be affected by us political change , observers said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nancy pelosi will be the first woman to be elected house speaker pelosi , who is now set to become the first woman in history to be elected house speaker , said mid-term election results proved that the american people felt it was time for a change .
the influential san francisco liberal is already on record as calling for a phased withdrawal of us troops from iraq and indicated she would continue to campaign for a pullout . pelosi voted against the 2002 resolution authorizing the use of force in iraq . " today the american people voted for change and they voted for democrats to take our country in a new direction , " pelosi said .
" and that is exactly what we intend to do . " europeans expected to welcome democratic advance pelosi 's words are likely to assure many european leaders , particularly germany and france who were vocal opponents of the war in iraq .
even in countries that traditionally supported the bush administration on the iraq war , the mood has palpably changed in recent months as the chaos and bloodshed in iraq has taken a turn for the worse . europeans will be also be hoping that a decisive advance by democrats in the us election could usher in a new era in transatlantic cooperation . " many in europe would like to see bush get a bloody nose in these elections and view the democrats as closer to the european way of thinking , " mark leonard , a foreign policy analyst at the london-based center for european reform told the daily international herald tribune . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenegger bucked the anti-republican trend antonio missiroli , chief political analyst of the european policy center in brussels , added that speculation on the departure of us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld will likely increase , as he will be made a " scapegoat " for the iraq debacle . " europeans would expect some change in policy , and possibly also personnel . ... i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face -lrb- as defense secretary -rrb- , and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " democrats also gained six gubernatorial seats in to take the majority of state houses for the first time in 12 years , us media reported . former hollywood action star arnold schwarzenegger bucked the anti-republican trend and was re-elected governor of california , helped to victory by his pro-environment stance .
but democrats picked up governorships in six other states from republicans , scoring wins in the previously republican-held states of arkansas , colorado , maryland , massachusetts , new york and ohio , according to projections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton says america has voted for change thus , european policy analyst missiroli said , a main effect of the election may not come from the democrats at all , but from members of president bush 's own party . " my impression is that -lrb- on environmental issues , -rrb- the midterm elections will matter more for the gubernatorial races than for congress , " missoli said .
schwarzenegger 's victory " might mean it is still possible for a republican political leader to do an environment friendly policy , and therefore this could have consequences over the next months and years in american policy at large . " us votes for change the race for seats in the upper house of congress , the senate , were still being counted in virginia and montana , several hours after the close of voting .
whether the senate will be ruled by democrats or republicans is still unclear . but an upbeat hillary clinton said america had voted for change , after she was reelected to the senate tuesday .
she told her supporters that new york and the country wanted a new beginning . the former first lady , who easily secured reelection and is widely expected to run for the presidency in 2008 , told campaigners at her acceptance speech that she was prepared to " roll up my sleeves and get to work .

german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " i think the united states is going to become more protectionist and we will see less approval for international trade agreements , " scherpenberg said .
this could make the world trade organization 's doha round negotiations more difficult , he said . but whether the issues are economic or political , guérot said it had become clear to both sides that everyone had to work together . " europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .
but he said the german parliament would increasingly seek contact to the house , in particular to new congressmen and women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt is the foreign ministry 's transatlantic expert experts agreed that it was important to seek a dialogue to new representatives , in particular as many of them were lacking international experience . " this is an opportunity to develop a new relationship , " voigt said . guérot said european delegations should travel to the united states and us representatives be invited to europe . " what we need to do now is reach out , " she said .
" this way , we can better convey european positions on major international issues and make concerted efforts to find constructive political solutions for the future . " europe will see the united states with new eyes most europeans were crossing their fingers for the democrats in this campaign .
although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states . " the perception of the united states in europe has so far been shaped by the republicans and the american president , " voigt said .
" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said . " if europe perceives that the united states are striving to take on a new tone and a new direction , then public opinion here will turn positive , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .

german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .

" europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .

although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states .

" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 08.11.2006 eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic party supporters were in a jubilant mood europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq . democratic congresswoman nancy pelosi vowed to push for a change of policy in iraq on tuesday after her party gained control of the house of representatives on tuesday , for the first time since 1994 . the race for us senate in several states , and the ultimate balance of power in that body , was still too close to call several hours after polling closed . many europeans , watching the election results closely , are hoping the shift in leadership will lead to changes in iraq policy .
other issues important to europeans - such as broader middle east policy , trade , and environmental issues - are also likely to be affected by us political change , observers said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nancy pelosi will be the first woman to be elected house speaker pelosi , who is now set to become the first woman in history to be elected house speaker , said mid-term election results proved that the american people felt it was time for a change .
the influential san francisco liberal is already on record as calling for a phased withdrawal of us troops from iraq and indicated she would continue to campaign for a pullout . pelosi voted against the 2002 resolution authorizing the use of force in iraq . " today the american people voted for change and they voted for democrats to take our country in a new direction , " pelosi said .
" and that is exactly what we intend to do . " europeans expected to welcome democratic advance pelosi 's words are likely to assure many european leaders , particularly germany and france who were vocal opponents of the war in iraq .
even in countries that traditionally supported the bush administration on the iraq war , the mood has palpably changed in recent months as the chaos and bloodshed in iraq has taken a turn for the worse . europeans will be also be hoping that a decisive advance by democrats in the us election could usher in a new era in transatlantic cooperation . " many in europe would like to see bush get a bloody nose in these elections and view the democrats as closer to the european way of thinking , " mark leonard , a foreign policy analyst at the london-based center for european reform told the daily international herald tribune . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenegger bucked the anti-republican trend antonio missiroli , chief political analyst of the european policy center in brussels , added that speculation on the departure of us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld will likely increase , as he will be made a " scapegoat " for the iraq debacle . " europeans would expect some change in policy , and possibly also personnel . ... i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face -lrb- as defense secretary -rrb- , and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " democrats also gained six gubernatorial seats in to take the majority of state houses for the first time in 12 years , us media reported . former hollywood action star arnold schwarzenegger bucked the anti-republican trend and was re-elected governor of california , helped to victory by his pro-environment stance .
but democrats picked up governorships in six other states from republicans , scoring wins in the previously republican-held states of arkansas , colorado , maryland , massachusetts , new york and ohio , according to projections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton says america has voted for change thus , european policy analyst missiroli said , a main effect of the election may not come from the democrats at all , but from members of president bush 's own party . " my impression is that -lrb- on environmental issues , -rrb- the midterm elections will matter more for the gubernatorial races than for congress , " missoli said .
schwarzenegger 's victory " might mean it is still possible for a republican political leader to do an environment friendly policy , and therefore this could have consequences over the next months and years in american policy at large . " us votes for change the race for seats in the upper house of congress , the senate , were still being counted in virginia and montana , several hours after the close of voting .
whether the senate will be ruled by democrats or republicans is still unclear . but an upbeat hillary clinton said america had voted for change , after she was reelected to the senate tuesday .
she told her supporters that new york and the country wanted a new beginning . the former first lady , who easily secured reelection and is widely expected to run for the presidency in 2008 , told campaigners at her acceptance speech that she was prepared to " roll up my sleeves and get to work . " flanked by husband and former president bill clinton , she pointed to the wide picture of democrat gains , with control of both the senate and house of representatives in the opposition party 's sights . " this is a big night for democrats , is n't it ? ...

but the bloc is also expected to take aim at what it sees as insufficient reform in a number of areas . according to initial reports about the content of the report , the eu will continue to encourage turkey in its bid for accession .
however , it will also take ankara to task for the pace with which it is implementing mandatory reforms .
cyprus , already an eu member , remains a nagging issue .
turkey , which claims the divided island as a part of its national territory , has been reluctant to agree to any moves that could imply any recognition by ankara of cypriot sovereignty .
the report also focuses on the slowing pace of turkish reforms in general .
it calls for further efforts to strengthen rights for religious and ethnic minorities , women and trade unions .
it urges ankara to assert civilian control over the military .
and it criticizes a turkish law against " insulting turkishness , " which the eu says impinges on turkish citizens ' freedom of expression .
the port plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are trying to find a compromise on cyprus eu officials said that european commission president jose manuel barroso is determined to give turkey a chance to institute the necessary reforms .
but in the face of many europeans ' growing scepticism toward ankara 's bid , significant progress will have to be made before eu leaders meet in mid-december to decide whether the accession process should continue .
finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has reportedly drafted a plan aimed at bringing some movement on the issue of cyprus .
the details are being kept secret at present , but the plan allegedly calls upon turkey to open its ports to ships from cyprus - in accordance with the eu customs union . turkey agreed in 2005 to extend its customs agreements with the original 15 members of the eu to all of the bloc 's newer members , including cyprus .
but thus far , it has kept its ports and airports closed to cypriot ships and planes . turkish failure to yield on this issue could lead to a suspension of membership talks . germany in the hot seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants turkish prime minister recep erdogan to take a new direction turkey 's bid for eu membership could become a major political headache for germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel . she will be expected to make progress on the issue when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
but merkel herself is sceptical about turkey 's suitability for the bloc , and members of her own grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats are divided along party lines . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , called for membership negotiations to be suspended .
" the major deficits in the human rights situation in turkey , " said stoiber , " as well as the crass breach of contract toward cyprus as an eu member state have to elicit consequences .
we ca n't pretend nothing has happened . " german social democrats , who supported turkey 's bid for accession under former chancellor gerhard schröder , were quick to reject stoiber 's demands .
germany 's social democrat foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , warned against inflaming the situation .
germany , steinmeier said , " had every interest in not escalating the conflict here . " turkish compromise on cyprus would take the heat off the eu and merkel .
but although turkish prime minister recep erdogan has expressed willingness to push through further legal reforms in his country , there is no telling whether he would be willing - or politically able - to back down on an issue to which turkey has historically attached so much national pride . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopeful of defusing looming crisis with turkey as positions over continuing accession talks with ankara harden , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was confident a solution could be found to turkey 's dispute with cyprus by the end of the year .

it calls for further efforts to strengthen rights for religious and ethnic minorities , women and trade unions .
it urges ankara to assert civilian control over the military .
and it criticizes a turkish law against " insulting turkishness , " which the eu says impinges on turkish citizens ' freedom of expression .
the port plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are trying to find a compromise on cyprus eu officials said that european commission president jose manuel barroso is determined to give turkey a chance to institute the necessary reforms .
but in the face of many europeans ' growing scepticism toward ankara 's bid , significant progress will have to be made before eu leaders meet in mid-december to decide whether the accession process should continue .
finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has reportedly drafted a plan aimed at bringing some movement on the issue of cyprus .
the details are being kept secret at present , but the plan allegedly calls upon turkey to open its ports to ships from cyprus - in accordance with the eu customs union . turkey agreed in 2005 to extend its customs agreements with the original 15 members of the eu to all of the bloc 's newer members , including cyprus .
but thus far , it has kept its ports and airports closed to cypriot ships and planes . turkish failure to yield on this issue could lead to a suspension of membership talks . germany in the hot seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants turkish prime minister recep erdogan to take a new direction turkey 's bid for eu membership could become a major political headache for germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel . she will be expected to make progress on the issue when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
but merkel herself is sceptical about turkey 's suitability for the bloc , and members of her own grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats are divided along party lines . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , called for membership negotiations to be suspended .
" the major deficits in the human rights situation in turkey , " said stoiber , " as well as the crass breach of contract toward cyprus as an eu member state have to elicit consequences .
we ca n't pretend nothing has happened . " german social democrats , who supported turkey 's bid for accession under former chancellor gerhard schröder , were quick to reject stoiber 's demands .
germany 's social democrat foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , warned against inflaming the situation .
germany , steinmeier said , " had every interest in not escalating the conflict here . " turkish compromise on cyprus would take the heat off the eu and merkel .
but although turkish prime minister recep erdogan has expressed willingness to push through further legal reforms in his country , there is no telling whether he would be willing - or politically able - to back down on an issue to which turkey has historically attached so much national pride . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopeful of defusing looming crisis with turkey as positions over continuing accession talks with ankara harden , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was confident a solution could be found to turkey 's dispute with cyprus by the end of the year .

but the bloc is also expected to take aim at what it sees as insufficient reform in a number of areas . according to initial reports about the content of the report , the eu will continue to encourage turkey in its bid for accession .
however , it will also take ankara to task for the pace with which it is implementing mandatory reforms .
cyprus , already an eu member , remains a nagging issue .
turkey , which claims the divided island as a part of its national territory , has been reluctant to agree to any moves that could imply any recognition by ankara of cypriot sovereignty .
the report also focuses on the slowing pace of turkish reforms in general .
it calls for further efforts to strengthen rights for religious and ethnic minorities , women and trade unions .
it urges ankara to assert civilian control over the military .
and it criticizes a turkish law against " insulting turkishness , " which the eu says impinges on turkish citizens ' freedom of expression .
the port plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are trying to find a compromise on cyprus eu officials said that european commission president jose manuel barroso is determined to give turkey a chance to institute the necessary reforms .
but in the face of many europeans ' growing scepticism toward ankara 's bid , significant progress will have to be made before eu leaders meet in mid-december to decide whether the accession process should continue .
finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has reportedly drafted a plan aimed at bringing some movement on the issue of cyprus .
the details are being kept secret at present , but the plan allegedly calls upon turkey to open its ports to ships from cyprus - in accordance with the eu customs union . turkey agreed in 2005 to extend its customs agreements with the original 15 members of the eu to all of the bloc 's newer members , including cyprus .
but thus far , it has kept its ports and airports closed to cypriot ships and planes . turkish failure to yield on this issue could lead to a suspension of membership talks . germany in the hot seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants turkish prime minister recep erdogan to take a new direction turkey 's bid for eu membership could become a major political headache for germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel . she will be expected to make progress on the issue when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
but merkel herself is sceptical about turkey 's suitability for the bloc , and members of her own grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats are divided along party lines . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , called for membership negotiations to be suspended .
" the major deficits in the human rights situation in turkey , " said stoiber , " as well as the crass breach of contract toward cyprus as an eu member state have to elicit consequences .
we ca n't pretend nothing has happened . " german social democrats , who supported turkey 's bid for accession under former chancellor gerhard schröder , were quick to reject stoiber 's demands .
germany 's social democrat foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , warned against inflaming the situation .
germany , steinmeier said , " had every interest in not escalating the conflict here . " turkish compromise on cyprus would take the heat off the eu and merkel .
but although turkish prime minister recep erdogan has expressed willingness to push through further legal reforms in his country , there is no telling whether he would be willing - or politically able - to back down on an issue to which turkey has historically attached so much national pride . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopeful of defusing looming crisis with turkey as positions over continuing accession talks with ankara harden , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was confident a solution could be found to turkey 's dispute with cyprus by the end of the year .

nearly 70 years later , a memorial was dedicated to the " good german " who saved thousands of chinese lives . there is an old saying : " you ca n't go further than china . "
a century ago , the journey from germany took 10 days across the eurasian landmass via the trans-siberian railroad , or it took a month by ship through the suez canal to the eastern port city of shanghai . the 1930s was a time of economic depression at home that helped lead to the rise of adolf hitler . but abroad , germany 's trade with china flourished , and the people there knew little of what was happening in the heart of europe . mercenaries , missionaries or misfits german expatriates who were posted to the far east were largely out of touch with events unfolding in europe and generally fell into one of three categories : mercenaries , missionaries or misfits . john rabe , born 1882 in the northern port city of hamburg , was a combination of all three .
a member of the nazi party in germany , rabe sold turbines and telegraph equipment for siemens , and rose to become the german company 's chief trade representative in the chinese wartime capital of nanking , now called nanjing . his career in china from 1908 to 1938 would have been unremarkable , except for one thing : the meticulous 1,200-page diary he kept that chronicled daily life during a nearly forgotten chapter of the second sino-japanese war . saving lives with a swastika during the japanese occupation , however , rabe did something else that influenced more lives than a journal ever could : he used his nazi credentials to rescue thousands of chinese from certain death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabe documented the nanking massacre when the japanese army , which had already occupied northern china , invaded nanking in 1937 , most westerners fled the besieged city . but rabe and a handful of other foreigners , mainly german , american and british missionaries and doctors , stayed behind . using his influence as a card-carrying member of the national socialist , or nazi party , rabe led an effort to rescue over 250,000 chinese civilians , who would have otherwise perished in a six-week orgy of torture and killing known today as the nanking massacre . " the japanese had pistols and bayonets .
i had only my nazi party symbols and my swastika armband , " rabe wrote in his diary .
chinese officials say that 300,000 were slaughtered in nanjing , a disputed figure that some war historians say is inflated . revered as a " living buddha " in china last week a memorial in nanjing was dedicated to the " good nazi " who was revered as a " living buddha " in china .
known by many americans as the " oskar schindler of china , " rabe has remained virtually unknown in the country of his birth . when rabe returned to germany in 1938 , he gave public lectures about the nanking atrocities , expecting hitler to use his influence with an axis ally .
instead , he was detained by the gestapo . he continued working for siemens in berlin , and was briefly posted to afghanistan .
after the war , he was arrested first by the soviets , then the british , and petitioned to be " de-nazified . " he won the fight against the ideology behind the symbols he used to save lives , but the legal costs had left his family penniless .
when the nanking survivors of his largesse heard about his plight , they sent him care packages .
he died in 1950 of a stroke .
former home is now a museum rabe 's former home in the then international settlement in nanking , which had become a safe haven for the chinese , is now a museum and center for international research , peace and reconciliation .

nearly 70 years later , a memorial was dedicated to the " good german " who saved thousands of chinese lives . there is an old saying : " you ca n't go further than china . "
a century ago , the journey from germany took 10 days across the eurasian landmass via the trans-siberian railroad , or it took a month by ship through the suez canal to the eastern port city of shanghai . the 1930s was a time of economic depression at home that helped lead to the rise of adolf hitler . but abroad , germany 's trade with china flourished , and the people there knew little of what was happening in the heart of europe . mercenaries , missionaries or misfits german expatriates who were posted to the far east were largely out of touch with events unfolding in europe and generally fell into one of three categories : mercenaries , missionaries or misfits . john rabe , born 1882 in the northern port city of hamburg , was a combination of all three .
a member of the nazi party in germany , rabe sold turbines and telegraph equipment for siemens , and rose to become the german company 's chief trade representative in the chinese wartime capital of nanking , now called nanjing . his career in china from 1908 to 1938 would have been unremarkable , except for one thing : the meticulous 1,200-page diary he kept that chronicled daily life during a nearly forgotten chapter of the second sino-japanese war . saving lives with a swastika during the japanese occupation , however , rabe did something else that influenced more lives than a journal ever could : he used his nazi credentials to rescue thousands of chinese from certain death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabe documented the nanking massacre when the japanese army , which had already occupied northern china , invaded nanking in 1937 , most westerners fled the besieged city . but rabe and a handful of other foreigners , mainly german , american and british missionaries and doctors , stayed behind . using his influence as a card-carrying member of the national socialist , or nazi party , rabe led an effort to rescue over 250,000 chinese civilians , who would have otherwise perished in a six-week orgy of torture and killing known today as the nanking massacre . " the japanese had pistols and bayonets .
i had only my nazi party symbols and my swastika armband , " rabe wrote in his diary .
chinese officials say that 300,000 were slaughtered in nanjing , a disputed figure that some war historians say is inflated . revered as a " living buddha " in china last week a memorial in nanjing was dedicated to the " good nazi " who was revered as a " living buddha " in china .
known by many americans as the " oskar schindler of china , " rabe has remained virtually unknown in the country of his birth . when rabe returned to germany in 1938 , he gave public lectures about the nanking atrocities , expecting hitler to use his influence with an axis ally .
instead , he was detained by the gestapo . he continued working for siemens in berlin , and was briefly posted to afghanistan .
after the war , he was arrested first by the soviets , then the british , and petitioned to be " de-nazified . " he won the fight against the ideology behind the symbols he used to save lives , but the legal costs had left his family penniless .
when the nanking survivors of his largesse heard about his plight , they sent him care packages .
he died in 1950 of a stroke .
former home is now a museum rabe 's former home in the then international settlement in nanking , which had become a safe haven for the chinese , is now a museum and center for international research , peace and reconciliation .

german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " i think the united states is going to become more protectionist and we will see less approval for international trade agreements , " scherpenberg said .
this could make the world trade organization 's doha round negotiations more difficult , he said . but whether the issues are economic or political , guérot said it had become clear to both sides that everyone had to work together . " europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .
but he said the german parliament would increasingly seek contact to the house , in particular to new congressmen and women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt is the foreign ministry 's transatlantic expert experts agreed that it was important to seek a dialogue to new representatives , in particular as many of them were lacking international experience . " this is an opportunity to develop a new relationship , " voigt said . guérot said european delegations should travel to the united states and us representatives be invited to europe . " what we need to do now is reach out , " she said .
" this way , we can better convey european positions on major international issues and make concerted efforts to find constructive political solutions for the future . " europe will see the united states with new eyes most europeans were crossing their fingers for the democrats in this campaign .
although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states . " the perception of the united states in europe has so far been shaped by the republicans and the american president , " voigt said .
" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said . " if europe perceives that the united states are striving to take on a new tone and a new direction , then public opinion here will turn positive , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .

and i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " ' end of a nightmare ' the bush administration was widely seen to have alienated europe and much of the rest of the world by its " with us or against us " approach to iraq , alleged human rights abuses at guantanamo bay prison , and its stance on ecological issues – particularly its refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-us sentiment is openly , and frequently , expressed in europe now , it seems bush 's bill has come due , and europeans are openly happy about it . " there is less white house in america now and a little less america in the world , " dominique moisi , special councillor at the french institute of international relations , told reuters news service . " the demise of -lrb- bush 's -rrb- america is good news for all those who love america , " he added . the socialist group in the european parliament , the second-largest bloc following the conservative grouping , hailed the election result , saying bush had been " seriously weakened . " " we are relieved that we now see the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world , " said martin schulz , the president of the 201-strong socialist group . slow change is likely many analysts did not expect democrats to change things too quickly in iraq , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's tony blair was one of few european leaders to stand behind bush " the democrats will make life unpleasant for bush , but they are not going to get much in his way because they do n't want to be tarred by defeat in iraq , " francois heisbourg , a special councillor at the foundation for strategic research in paris told reuters . trade talks may sour observers also worried that trade negotiations currently underway between the us and the european union could take a hit , post-election . " the democratic congress would probably be marginally more protectionist than the current one and this would not bode well for the current negotiations in the wto framework , considering in particular that the ' fast track ' mandate for the bush administration for striking a deal expires in july 2007 , " the european policy center 's missiroli said . bush 's " fast track " negotiating power allows him to authorize trade deals . even britain is glad but such policy concerns did not dampen broad satisfaction in many european capitals , amid continued growing unhappiness over u.s. leadership . even people in washington 's closest european ally , britain , appeared glad to see bush lose his majority in congress . " he 's not the leader he was .
he does n't seem to be making the decisions , there seems to be no sense to what he is doing anymore , " john hayward , a logistics manager in london , told reuters . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .

other issues important to europeans - such as broader middle east policy , trade , and environmental issues - are also likely to be affected by us political change , observers said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nancy pelosi will be the first woman to be elected house speaker pelosi , who is now set to become the first woman in history to be elected house speaker , said mid-term election results proved that the american people felt it was time for a change .
the influential san francisco liberal is already on record as calling for a phased withdrawal of us troops from iraq and indicated she would continue to campaign for a pullout . pelosi voted against the 2002 resolution authorizing the use of force in iraq . " today the american people voted for change and they voted for democrats to take our country in a new direction , " pelosi said .
" and that is exactly what we intend to do . " europeans expected to welcome democratic advance pelosi 's words are likely to assure many european leaders , particularly germany and france who were vocal opponents of the war in iraq .

german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " i think the united states is going to become more protectionist and we will see less approval for international trade agreements , " scherpenberg said .
this could make the world trade organization 's doha round negotiations more difficult , he said . but whether the issues are economic or political , guérot said it had become clear to both sides that everyone had to work together . " europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .
but he said the german parliament would increasingly seek contact to the house , in particular to new congressmen and women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt is the foreign ministry 's transatlantic expert experts agreed that it was important to seek a dialogue to new representatives , in particular as many of them were lacking international experience . " this is an opportunity to develop a new relationship , " voigt said . guérot said european delegations should travel to the united states and us representatives be invited to europe . " what we need to do now is reach out , " she said .
" this way , we can better convey european positions on major international issues and make concerted efforts to find constructive political solutions for the future . " europe will see the united states with new eyes most europeans were crossing their fingers for the democrats in this campaign .
although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states . " the perception of the united states in europe has so far been shaped by the republicans and the american president , " voigt said .
" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said .

german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " i think the united states is going to become more protectionist and we will see less approval for international trade agreements , " scherpenberg said .
this could make the world trade organization 's doha round negotiations more difficult , he said . but whether the issues are economic or political , guérot said it had become clear to both sides that everyone had to work together . " europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .
but he said the german parliament would increasingly seek contact to the house , in particular to new congressmen and women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt is the foreign ministry 's transatlantic expert experts agreed that it was important to seek a dialogue to new representatives , in particular as many of them were lacking international experience . " this is an opportunity to develop a new relationship , " voigt said . guérot said european delegations should travel to the united states and us representatives be invited to europe . " what we need to do now is reach out , " she said .
" this way , we can better convey european positions on major international issues and make concerted efforts to find constructive political solutions for the future . " europe will see the united states with new eyes most europeans were crossing their fingers for the democrats in this campaign .
although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states . " the perception of the united states in europe has so far been shaped by the republicans and the american president , " voigt said .
" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said . " if europe perceives that the united states are striving to take on a new tone and a new direction , then public opinion here will turn positive , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .

the market is expending and the german-born pontifex maximus is jumping on the bandwagon . pope benedict xvi may be a conservative theologian and staunch believer in the catholic dogma , but when it comes to fashion , he is on the cutting edge .
with his penchant for designer sunglasses , padded quilt jackets and exclusive italian footwear , the 79-year-old leader of the catholic church is continuing to attract ecumenical amazement from the world 's leading fashionistas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody can deny that benedict xvi is a man of style what the pope has done to red prada shoes is what the cult us tv series " sex and the city " did to manolo blahniks .
it brought the world of high fashion closer to the common man . if fashion is the new universal language which transcends borders imposed by religion and culture , then papa ratzi - as the former cardinal joseph ratzinger is affectionately called by his adoring fans - is the true herald of sublime color and graceful style .
for a while , gray was the new black .
then black was the new black .
these days - and largely thanks to papal gorgeous footwear - red is the new gray . it should come as no surprise that the time has arrived for an ultimate test of the pope 's celebrity status : an illustrated calendar .
good-bye , sports illustrated !
good-bye victoria 's secret !
hello , vatican uncovered ! a year with the pope the 2007 calendar containing 14 exclusive shots of the 79-year-old roman pontiff and entitled " together - a year with the pope " will appear in italy on nov .
23 together with the catholic weekly famiglia cristiana .
it will cost 5 euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's fashion-conscious swiss guards " this has nothing to do with other calendars , we have our own style and a distinct target , " the magazine 's patrizia brero told dpa .
" our readers would n't have appreciated a calendar featuring television starlets or nude models . " the photographs for this unique glossy calendar were taken over the summer at the pope 's residence in castel gandolfo , south of rome , by photographer giancarlo giuliani .
this is the first time in history that a pope has posed for a photographer . for every copy sold , one euro off the sales price will be donated to a charitable organization for children in rwanda .
the charity was selected by the pope in person . look , ma , it 's a new pope the slogan chosen by famiglia cristiana to sell the calendar - " you 'll see a new pope every day " - remains somewhat puzzling considering that there will be only 14 pictures of the pope in the calendar : one for each month and two on the cover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a 2005 poll , benedict xvi and shakira were the world 's most popular photo personalities how will the faithful manage to see a new pope every day is not exactly clear .
those who are expecting embedded high-tech displays , special effects or simple , old-fashioned miracles may end up having their hopes frustrated . seeing a new pope in the same old picture every day will probably require deep religious commitment or , alternatively , a couple of glasses of chianti or pino grigio . it has become tradition in italy for magazines to offer calendars to their readers this time of the year . the world 's best-known calendar is italian .
published since 1964 , the pirelli calendar usually features naked models or liberally undressed celebrities photographed by some of the world 's most famous photographers . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de of politicians , passports and popes germans are known as serious and hard-working people , but the country 's unruly politicians are habitually letting passions and intrigues run rampant .
now , even the pope has been dragged into the post-election fun ride .
-lrb- 07.11.2005 -rrb- prada pope causes " cassock war " with his penchant for designer eyewear and italian shoes , pope benedict xvi is becoming an unlikely style icon .
a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors .

nearly 70 years later , a memorial was dedicated to the " good german " who saved thousands of chinese lives . there is an old saying : " you ca n't go further than china . "
a century ago , the journey from germany took 10 days across the eurasian landmass via the trans-siberian railroad , or it took a month by ship through the suez canal to the eastern port city of shanghai . the 1930s was a time of economic depression at home that helped lead to the rise of adolf hitler . but abroad , germany 's trade with china flourished , and the people there knew little of what was happening in the heart of europe . mercenaries , missionaries or misfits german expatriates who were posted to the far east were largely out of touch with events unfolding in europe and generally fell into one of three categories : mercenaries , missionaries or misfits . john rabe , born 1882 in the northern port city of hamburg , was a combination of all three .
a member of the nazi party in germany , rabe sold turbines and telegraph equipment for siemens , and rose to become the german company 's chief trade representative in the chinese wartime capital of nanking , now called nanjing . his career in china from 1908 to 1938 would have been unremarkable , except for one thing : the meticulous 1,200-page diary he kept that chronicled daily life during a nearly forgotten chapter of the second sino-japanese war . saving lives with a swastika during the japanese occupation , however , rabe did something else that influenced more lives than a journal ever could : he used his nazi credentials to rescue thousands of chinese from certain death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabe documented the nanking massacre when the japanese army , which had already occupied northern china , invaded nanking in 1937 , most westerners fled the besieged city . but rabe and a handful of other foreigners , mainly german , american and british missionaries and doctors , stayed behind . using his influence as a card-carrying member of the national socialist , or nazi party , rabe led an effort to rescue over 250,000 chinese civilians , who would have otherwise perished in a six-week orgy of torture and killing known today as the nanking massacre . " the japanese had pistols and bayonets .
i had only my nazi party symbols and my swastika armband , " rabe wrote in his diary .
chinese officials say that 300,000 were slaughtered in nanjing , a disputed figure that some war historians say is inflated . revered as a " living buddha " in china last week a memorial in nanjing was dedicated to the " good nazi " who was revered as a " living buddha " in china .
known by many americans as the " oskar schindler of china , " rabe has remained virtually unknown in the country of his birth . when rabe returned to germany in 1938 , he gave public lectures about the nanking atrocities , expecting hitler to use his influence with an axis ally .
instead , he was detained by the gestapo . he continued working for siemens in berlin , and was briefly posted to afghanistan .
after the war , he was arrested first by the soviets , then the british , and petitioned to be " de-nazified . " he won the fight against the ideology behind the symbols he used to save lives , but the legal costs had left his family penniless .
when the nanking survivors of his largesse heard about his plight , they sent him care packages .
he died in 1950 of a stroke .
former home is now a museum rabe 's former home in the then international settlement in nanking , which had become a safe haven for the chinese , is now a museum and center for international research , peace and reconciliation .

" the japanese had pistols and bayonets .
i had only my nazi party symbols and my swastika armband , " rabe wrote in his diary .
chinese officials say that 300,000 were slaughtered in nanjing , a disputed figure that some war historians say is inflated . revered as a " living buddha " in china last week a memorial in nanjing was dedicated to the " good nazi " who was revered as a " living buddha " in china .
known by many americans as the " oskar schindler of china , " rabe has remained virtually unknown in the country of his birth . when rabe returned to germany in 1938 , he gave public lectures about the nanking atrocities , expecting hitler to use his influence with an axis ally .
instead , he was detained by the gestapo . he continued working for siemens in berlin , and was briefly posted to afghanistan .
after the war , he was arrested first by the soviets , then the british , and petitioned to be " de-nazified . " he won the fight against the ideology behind the symbols he used to save lives , but the legal costs had left his family penniless .

other issues important to europeans - such as broader middle east policy , trade , and environmental issues - are also likely to be affected by us political change , observers said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nancy pelosi will be the first woman to be elected house speaker pelosi , who is now set to become the first woman in history to be elected house speaker , said mid-term election results proved that the american people felt it was time for a change .
the influential san francisco liberal is already on record as calling for a phased withdrawal of us troops from iraq and indicated she would continue to campaign for a pullout . pelosi voted against the 2002 resolution authorizing the use of force in iraq . " today the american people voted for change and they voted for democrats to take our country in a new direction , " pelosi said .
" and that is exactly what we intend to do . " europeans expected to welcome democratic advance pelosi 's words are likely to assure many european leaders , particularly germany and france who were vocal opponents of the war in iraq .
even in countries that traditionally supported the bush administration on the iraq war , the mood has palpably changed in recent months as the chaos and bloodshed in iraq has taken a turn for the worse . europeans will be also be hoping that a decisive advance by democrats in the us election could usher in a new era in transatlantic cooperation . " many in europe would like to see bush get a bloody nose in these elections and view the democrats as closer to the european way of thinking , " mark leonard , a foreign policy analyst at the london-based center for european reform told the daily international herald tribune . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenegger bucked the anti-republican trend antonio missiroli , chief political analyst of the european policy center in brussels , added that speculation on the departure of us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld will likely increase , as he will be made a " scapegoat " for the iraq debacle . " europeans would expect some change in policy , and possibly also personnel . ... i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face -lrb- as defense secretary -rrb- , and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " democrats also gained six gubernatorial seats in to take the majority of state houses for the first time in 12 years , us media reported . former hollywood action star arnold schwarzenegger bucked the anti-republican trend and was re-elected governor of california , helped to victory by his pro-environment stance .
but democrats picked up governorships in six other states from republicans , scoring wins in the previously republican-held states of arkansas , colorado , maryland , massachusetts , new york and ohio , according to projections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton says america has voted for change thus , european policy analyst missiroli said , a main effect of the election may not come from the democrats at all , but from members of president bush 's own party . " my impression is that -lrb- on environmental issues , -rrb- the midterm elections will matter more for the gubernatorial races than for congress , " missoli said .
schwarzenegger 's victory " might mean it is still possible for a republican political leader to do an environment friendly policy , and therefore this could have consequences over the next months and years in american policy at large . " us votes for change the race for seats in the upper house of congress , the senate , were still being counted in virginia and montana , several hours after the close of voting .
whether the senate will be ruled by democrats or republicans is still unclear . but an upbeat hillary clinton said america had voted for change , after she was reelected to the senate tuesday .
she told her supporters that new york and the country wanted a new beginning . the former first lady , who easily secured reelection and is widely expected to run for the presidency in 2008 , told campaigners at her acceptance speech that she was prepared to " roll up my sleeves and get to work . " flanked by husband and former president bill clinton , she pointed to the wide picture of democrat gains , with control of both the senate and house of representatives in the opposition party 's sights . " this is a big night for democrats , is n't it ? ...
i want to thank you for standing up for change , " she told screaming supporters in a new york hotel . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " i hope an issue like iraq will draw americans to the polls " will tuesday 's elections in the us lead to a democratic congress and republican president ?
americans living in germany have sent their absentee ballots and shared their thoughts on the elections and the issues at stake .

but the bloc is also expected to take aim at what it sees as insufficient reform in a number of areas . according to initial reports about the content of the report , the eu will continue to encourage turkey in its bid for accession .
however , it will also take ankara to task for the pace with which it is implementing mandatory reforms .
cyprus , already an eu member , remains a nagging issue .
turkey , which claims the divided island as a part of its national territory , has been reluctant to agree to any moves that could imply any recognition by ankara of cypriot sovereignty .
the report also focuses on the slowing pace of turkish reforms in general .
it calls for further efforts to strengthen rights for religious and ethnic minorities , women and trade unions .
it urges ankara to assert civilian control over the military .
and it criticizes a turkish law against " insulting turkishness , " which the eu says impinges on turkish citizens ' freedom of expression .
the port plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders are trying to find a compromise on cyprus eu officials said that european commission president jose manuel barroso is determined to give turkey a chance to institute the necessary reforms .
but in the face of many europeans ' growing scepticism toward ankara 's bid , significant progress will have to be made before eu leaders meet in mid-december to decide whether the accession process should continue .
finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has reportedly drafted a plan aimed at bringing some movement on the issue of cyprus .
the details are being kept secret at present , but the plan allegedly calls upon turkey to open its ports to ships from cyprus - in accordance with the eu customs union . turkey agreed in 2005 to extend its customs agreements with the original 15 members of the eu to all of the bloc 's newer members , including cyprus .
but thus far , it has kept its ports and airports closed to cypriot ships and planes . turkish failure to yield on this issue could lead to a suspension of membership talks . germany in the hot seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants turkish prime minister recep erdogan to take a new direction turkey 's bid for eu membership could become a major political headache for germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel . she will be expected to make progress on the issue when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
but merkel herself is sceptical about turkey 's suitability for the bloc , and members of her own grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats are divided along party lines . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , called for membership negotiations to be suspended .
" the major deficits in the human rights situation in turkey , " said stoiber , " as well as the crass breach of contract toward cyprus as an eu member state have to elicit consequences .
we ca n't pretend nothing has happened . " german social democrats , who supported turkey 's bid for accession under former chancellor gerhard schröder , were quick to reject stoiber 's demands .
germany 's social democrat foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , warned against inflaming the situation .
germany , steinmeier said , " had every interest in not escalating the conflict here . " turkish compromise on cyprus would take the heat off the eu and merkel .
but although turkish prime minister recep erdogan has expressed willingness to push through further legal reforms in his country , there is no telling whether he would be willing - or politically able - to back down on an issue to which turkey has historically attached so much national pride . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopeful of defusing looming crisis with turkey as positions over continuing accession talks with ankara harden , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was confident a solution could be found to turkey 's dispute with cyprus by the end of the year .

but thus far , it has kept its ports and airports closed to cypriot ships and planes . turkish failure to yield on this issue could lead to a suspension of membership talks . germany in the hot seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants turkish prime minister recep erdogan to take a new direction turkey 's bid for eu membership could become a major political headache for germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel . she will be expected to make progress on the issue when germany takes over the eu presidency in january .
but merkel herself is sceptical about turkey 's suitability for the bloc , and members of her own grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats are divided along party lines . on tuesday , edmund stoiber , head of the bavarian sister party of merkel 's cdu , called for membership negotiations to be suspended .
" the major deficits in the human rights situation in turkey , " said stoiber , " as well as the crass breach of contract toward cyprus as an eu member state have to elicit consequences .
we ca n't pretend nothing has happened . " german social democrats , who supported turkey 's bid for accession under former chancellor gerhard schröder , were quick to reject stoiber 's demands .
germany 's social democrat foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , warned against inflaming the situation .
germany , steinmeier said , " had every interest in not escalating the conflict here . " turkish compromise on cyprus would take the heat off the eu and merkel .
but although turkish prime minister recep erdogan has expressed willingness to push through further legal reforms in his country , there is no telling whether he would be willing - or politically able - to back down on an issue to which turkey has historically attached so much national pride . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hopeful of defusing looming crisis with turkey as positions over continuing accession talks with ankara harden , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was confident a solution could be found to turkey 's dispute with cyprus by the end of the year .

german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " i think the united states is going to become more protectionist and we will see less approval for international trade agreements , " scherpenberg said .
this could make the world trade organization 's doha round negotiations more difficult , he said . but whether the issues are economic or political , guérot said it had become clear to both sides that everyone had to work together . " europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .
but he said the german parliament would increasingly seek contact to the house , in particular to new congressmen and women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt is the foreign ministry 's transatlantic expert experts agreed that it was important to seek a dialogue to new representatives , in particular as many of them were lacking international experience . " this is an opportunity to develop a new relationship , " voigt said . guérot said european delegations should travel to the united states and us representatives be invited to europe . " what we need to do now is reach out , " she said .
" this way , we can better convey european positions on major international issues and make concerted efforts to find constructive political solutions for the future . " europe will see the united states with new eyes most europeans were crossing their fingers for the democrats in this campaign .
although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states . " the perception of the united states in europe has so far been shaped by the republicans and the american president , " voigt said .
" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said . " if europe perceives that the united states are striving to take on a new tone and a new direction , then public opinion here will turn positive , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .

the surprise announcement came in the middle of pischetsrieder 's plan to cut costs and jobs at the german car group . the 58-year-old volkswagen ceo will leave the wolfsburg-based company without seeing through his drastic restructuring program .
the plan called for cutting as many as 20,000 jobs and introducing longer industry working hours . the departure comes as a surprise , since pischetsrieder 's contract was recently extended another five years .
but there was already speculation over his tenure this spring .
since then , the relationship between pischetsrieder and chairman ferdinand piech had become increasingly tense . piech brought pischetsrieder to volkwagen in 2000 from bmw , but is now one of his biggest critics . pischetsrieder and piech clashed over plans for volkswagen to take part in a deal in the trucking industry .

a decision by us mail group fedex to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 super-jumbo planes caused massive third-quarter losses at airbus parent eads .
still , airbus expressed confidence in the embattled project . european aircraft maker airbus said tuesday it regretted the decision of us mail group fedex corp. to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 planes but expressed confidence in its beleaguered superjumbo project . production of the a380 - the world 's biggest civilian airliner , which is available as a passenger and cargo plane - has been beset by difficulties .

they 're engaged in " costume play " to get under the skin of manga heroes and interact with the comic world . the manga scene in germany is more than just a style phenomenon .
the japanese comics are big business .

young women 18 to 25 drive the market .
while men traditionally sat behind the drawing table , a wave of female artists have cropped up .
teenage girls regularly participate in competitions organized by publishing houses . although exact numbers do n't exist , the rise of young female manga artists began approximately four years ago . " at previous competitions , more than 90 percent of all contributions were from women , while less than 10 percent were drawn by young men , " said marcus tieschky , an organizer of the comic campus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for a manga drawing competition often , young women draw for a female audience while young men create stories for their male peers .

young artists copy the japanese style .

formerly , i was fascinated with satoshi urushihara and often tried to copy that style .
now , i am inspired by various artists , not only manga ones , " said berliner marie sann . the largest influences on german artists come from japanese manga , south korean manhwa and chinese manhua , tieschky said .

german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " i think the united states is going to become more protectionist and we will see less approval for international trade agreements , " scherpenberg said .
this could make the world trade organization 's doha round negotiations more difficult , he said . but whether the issues are economic or political , guérot said it had become clear to both sides that everyone had to work together . " europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .
but he said the german parliament would increasingly seek contact to the house , in particular to new congressmen and women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt is the foreign ministry 's transatlantic expert experts agreed that it was important to seek a dialogue to new representatives , in particular as many of them were lacking international experience . " this is an opportunity to develop a new relationship , " voigt said . guérot said european delegations should travel to the united states and us representatives be invited to europe . " what we need to do now is reach out , " she said .
" this way , we can better convey european positions on major international issues and make concerted efforts to find constructive political solutions for the future . " europe will see the united states with new eyes most europeans were crossing their fingers for the democrats in this campaign .
although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states . " the perception of the united states in europe has so far been shaped by the republicans and the american president , " voigt said .
" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said . " if europe perceives that the united states are striving to take on a new tone and a new direction , then public opinion here will turn positive , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .

german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " i think the united states is going to become more protectionist and we will see less approval for international trade agreements , " scherpenberg said .
this could make the world trade organization 's doha round negotiations more difficult , he said . but whether the issues are economic or political , guérot said it had become clear to both sides that everyone had to work together . " europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .
but he said the german parliament would increasingly seek contact to the house , in particular to new congressmen and women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt is the foreign ministry 's transatlantic expert experts agreed that it was important to seek a dialogue to new representatives , in particular as many of them were lacking international experience . " this is an opportunity to develop a new relationship , " voigt said . guérot said european delegations should travel to the united states and us representatives be invited to europe . " what we need to do now is reach out , " she said .
" this way , we can better convey european positions on major international issues and make concerted efforts to find constructive political solutions for the future . " europe will see the united states with new eyes most europeans were crossing their fingers for the democrats in this campaign .
although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states . " the perception of the united states in europe has so far been shaped by the republicans and the american president , " voigt said .
" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said .

observers said they hoped the us and europe could start healing widening trans-atlantic rifts . political observers in europe said they were hoping that a decisive advance by democrats in the us election could usher in a new era in trans-atlantic cooperation . many of those who saw us president george w. bush get a bloody nose in these elections expect us lawmakers to take a good hard look at us policy in iraq , first and foremost .

" the democratic congress would probably be marginally more protectionist than the current one and this would not bode well for the current negotiations in the wto framework , considering in particular that the ' fast track ' mandate for the bush administration for striking a deal expires in july 2007 , " the european policy center 's missiroli said . bush 's " fast track " negotiating power allows him to authorize trade deals . even britain is glad but such policy concerns did not dampen broad satisfaction in many european capitals , amid continued growing unhappiness over u.s. leadership . even people in washington 's closest european ally , britain , appeared glad to see bush lose his majority in congress .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 08.11.2006 europeans revel in us republican defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and eu flags may be cozy , but relations have become increasingly distant the european reaction to democrat wins in midterm us elections was overwhelmingly positive .
observers said they hoped the us and europe could start healing widening trans-atlantic rifts . political observers in europe said they were hoping that a decisive advance by democrats in the us election could usher in a new era in trans-atlantic cooperation . many of those who saw us president george w. bush get a bloody nose in these elections expect us lawmakers to take a good hard look at us policy in iraq , first and foremost . " europeans would expect some change in policy and possibly also personnel , " said antonio missiroli , chief political analyst of the european policy centre in brussels .
" it is not to be ruled out that … -lrb- us secretary of defense donald -rrb- rumsfeld might go .
and i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " ' end of a nightmare ' the bush administration was widely seen to have alienated europe and much of the rest of the world by its " with us or against us " approach to iraq , alleged human rights abuses at guantanamo bay prison , and its stance on ecological issues – particularly its refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-us sentiment is openly , and frequently , expressed in europe now , it seems bush 's bill has come due , and europeans are openly happy about it . " there is less white house in america now and a little less america in the world , " dominique moisi , special councillor at the french institute of international relations , told reuters news service . " the demise of -lrb- bush 's -rrb- america is good news for all those who love america , " he added . the socialist group in the european parliament , the second-largest bloc following the conservative grouping , hailed the election result , saying bush had been " seriously weakened . " " we are relieved that we now see the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world , " said martin schulz , the president of the 201-strong socialist group . slow change is likely many analysts did not expect democrats to change things too quickly in iraq , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's tony blair was one of few european leaders to stand behind bush " the democrats will make life unpleasant for bush , but they are not going to get much in his way because they do n't want to be tarred by defeat in iraq , " francois heisbourg , a special councillor at the foundation for strategic research in paris told reuters . trade talks may sour observers also worried that trade negotiations currently underway between the us and the european union could take a hit , post-election . " the democratic congress would probably be marginally more protectionist than the current one and this would not bode well for the current negotiations in the wto framework , considering in particular that the ' fast track ' mandate for the bush administration for striking a deal expires in july 2007 , " the european policy center 's missiroli said . bush 's " fast track " negotiating power allows him to authorize trade deals . even britain is glad but such policy concerns did not dampen broad satisfaction in many european capitals , amid continued growing unhappiness over u.s. leadership . even people in washington 's closest european ally , britain , appeared glad to see bush lose his majority in congress . " he 's not the leader he was .
he does n't seem to be making the decisions , there seems to be no sense to what he is doing anymore , " john hayward , a logistics manager in london , told reuters . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .
-lrb- 08.11.2006 -rrb- us elections mark new beginning for transatlantic ties the democratic party 's victory in us midterm elections has been welcomed across the atlantic .
german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion .
-lrb- 08.11.2006 -rrb- " i hope an issue like iraq will draw americans to the polls " will tuesday 's elections in the us lead to a democratic congress and republican president ?

nearly 70 years later , a memorial was dedicated to the " good german " who saved thousands of chinese lives . there is an old saying : " you ca n't go further than china . "
a century ago , the journey from germany took 10 days across the eurasian landmass via the trans-siberian railroad , or it took a month by ship through the suez canal to the eastern port city of shanghai . the 1930s was a time of economic depression at home that helped lead to the rise of adolf hitler . but abroad , germany 's trade with china flourished , and the people there knew little of what was happening in the heart of europe . mercenaries , missionaries or misfits german expatriates who were posted to the far east were largely out of touch with events unfolding in europe and generally fell into one of three categories : mercenaries , missionaries or misfits . john rabe , born 1882 in the northern port city of hamburg , was a combination of all three .
a member of the nazi party in germany , rabe sold turbines and telegraph equipment for siemens , and rose to become the german company 's chief trade representative in the chinese wartime capital of nanking , now called nanjing . his career in china from 1908 to 1938 would have been unremarkable , except for one thing : the meticulous 1,200-page diary he kept that chronicled daily life during a nearly forgotten chapter of the second sino-japanese war . saving lives with a swastika during the japanese occupation , however , rabe did something else that influenced more lives than a journal ever could : he used his nazi credentials to rescue thousands of chinese from certain death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rabe documented the nanking massacre when the japanese army , which had already occupied northern china , invaded nanking in 1937 , most westerners fled the besieged city . but rabe and a handful of other foreigners , mainly german , american and british missionaries and doctors , stayed behind . using his influence as a card-carrying member of the national socialist , or nazi party , rabe led an effort to rescue over 250,000 chinese civilians , who would have otherwise perished in a six-week orgy of torture and killing known today as the nanking massacre . " the japanese had pistols and bayonets .
i had only my nazi party symbols and my swastika armband , " rabe wrote in his diary .
chinese officials say that 300,000 were slaughtered in nanjing , a disputed figure that some war historians say is inflated . revered as a " living buddha " in china last week a memorial in nanjing was dedicated to the " good nazi " who was revered as a " living buddha " in china .
known by many americans as the " oskar schindler of china , " rabe has remained virtually unknown in the country of his birth . when rabe returned to germany in 1938 , he gave public lectures about the nanking atrocities , expecting hitler to use his influence with an axis ally .
instead , he was detained by the gestapo . he continued working for siemens in berlin , and was briefly posted to afghanistan .
after the war , he was arrested first by the soviets , then the british , and petitioned to be " de-nazified . " he won the fight against the ideology behind the symbols he used to save lives , but the legal costs had left his family penniless .
when the nanking survivors of his largesse heard about his plight , they sent him care packages .
he died in 1950 of a stroke .
former home is now a museum rabe 's former home in the then international settlement in nanking , which had become a safe haven for the chinese , is now a museum and center for international research , peace and reconciliation .

other issues important to europeans - such as broader middle east policy , trade , and environmental issues - are also likely to be affected by us political change , observers said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nancy pelosi will be the first woman to be elected house speaker pelosi , who is now set to become the first woman in history to be elected house speaker , said mid-term election results proved that the american people felt it was time for a change .
the influential san francisco liberal is already on record as calling for a phased withdrawal of us troops from iraq and indicated she would continue to campaign for a pullout . pelosi voted against the 2002 resolution authorizing the use of force in iraq . " today the american people voted for change and they voted for democrats to take our country in a new direction , " pelosi said .
" and that is exactly what we intend to do . " europeans expected to welcome democratic advance pelosi 's words are likely to assure many european leaders , particularly germany and france who were vocal opponents of the war in iraq .
even in countries that traditionally supported the bush administration on the iraq war , the mood has palpably changed in recent months as the chaos and bloodshed in iraq has taken a turn for the worse . europeans will be also be hoping that a decisive advance by democrats in the us election could usher in a new era in transatlantic cooperation . " many in europe would like to see bush get a bloody nose in these elections and view the democrats as closer to the european way of thinking , " mark leonard , a foreign policy analyst at the london-based center for european reform told the daily international herald tribune . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzenegger bucked the anti-republican trend antonio missiroli , chief political analyst of the european policy center in brussels , added that speculation on the departure of us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld will likely increase , as he will be made a " scapegoat " for the iraq debacle . " europeans would expect some change in policy , and possibly also personnel . ... i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face -lrb- as defense secretary -rrb- , and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " democrats also gained six gubernatorial seats in to take the majority of state houses for the first time in 12 years , us media reported . former hollywood action star arnold schwarzenegger bucked the anti-republican trend and was re-elected governor of california , helped to victory by his pro-environment stance .
but democrats picked up governorships in six other states from republicans , scoring wins in the previously republican-held states of arkansas , colorado , maryland , massachusetts , new york and ohio , according to projections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton says america has voted for change thus , european policy analyst missiroli said , a main effect of the election may not come from the democrats at all , but from members of president bush 's own party . " my impression is that -lrb- on environmental issues , -rrb- the midterm elections will matter more for the gubernatorial races than for congress , " missoli said .
schwarzenegger 's victory " might mean it is still possible for a republican political leader to do an environment friendly policy , and therefore this could have consequences over the next months and years in american policy at large . " us votes for change the race for seats in the upper house of congress , the senate , were still being counted in virginia and montana , several hours after the close of voting .
whether the senate will be ruled by democrats or republicans is still unclear . but an upbeat hillary clinton said america had voted for change , after she was reelected to the senate tuesday .
she told her supporters that new york and the country wanted a new beginning . the former first lady , who easily secured reelection and is widely expected to run for the presidency in 2008 , told campaigners at her acceptance speech that she was prepared to " roll up my sleeves and get to work . " flanked by husband and former president bill clinton , she pointed to the wide picture of democrat gains , with control of both the senate and house of representatives in the opposition party 's sights . " this is a big night for democrats , is n't it ? ...

a decision by us mail group fedex to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 super-jumbo planes caused massive third-quarter losses at airbus parent eads .
still , airbus expressed confidence in the embattled project . european aircraft maker airbus said tuesday it regretted the decision of us mail group fedex corp. to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 planes but expressed confidence in its beleaguered superjumbo project . production of the a380 - the world 's biggest civilian airliner , which is available as a passenger and cargo plane - has been beset by difficulties .
deliveries are running two years behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once on land , fedex packages are delivered by truck " we regret the decision by fedex but we understand that they had an urgent need for the means to continue their expansion , " said a spokeswoman for airbus . " we think that the a380 freighter will be an excellent plane for the 21st century offering the best performances to its clients , " she added . fedex turns to boeing on wednesday , airbus parent eads said it reported a net loss in the third quarter , a reverse from a profit a year earlier .
its earnings were hammered by the troubled commercial airplanes division , notably the behind-schedule a380 program , and a weak us dollar , the european aeronautic defence and space co. said .
it lost 195 million euros -lrb- $ 245 million -rrb- in july-september , from a net profit of euro279 million euros in the year-earlier quarter . on tuesday , fedex express , a unit of fedex , said it had pulled out of an order for 10 freighter versions of the european superjumbo " after airbus announced significant delays in delivery of the a380 . " instead , fedex express said it was buying 15 boeing 777 freighter planes with options to purchase another 15 . airbus has orders for 15 other a380 cargo planes , five from us plane leasing group ilfc and 10 from ups , the us-based rival for fedex . restructuring plan over the past months airbus has repeatedly cited persistent manufacturing problems as the reason for delays .
in response to these problems , the company has announced plans to restructure , cutting the number of its suppliers by more than 80 percent , a spokeswoman confirmed earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantas got some : an airbus a380 passes over sydney harbour the number of suppliers will be reduced " from 3,000 to 500 , " airbus spokeswoman marcella muratore told ap news service .
no further information was available on which suppliers would be dropped or the timetable for the cuts , she said . airbus ' comment confirmed a report in the german financial times deutschland newspaper monday that airbus planned to cut procurement costs by 350 million euros by 2010 ; the report - which cited the employee magazine of airbus parent eads - said the amount of components produced in low-wage countries is to rise by 50 percent . help for suppliers ? meanwhile , the german government may come to the aid of sub-contractors caught out by the airbus crisis , according to two german newsweeklies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus is undertaking a restructuring in response to delivery problems der spiegel and wirtschaftswoche said hans-joachim gante , who heads an industry group , bdli , had written to suppliers during the week saying financial aid was possible if companies were in dire straits or on the verge of bankruptcy . they said the circular had been suggested by the german government , and called for the companies to state the financial impact that the airbus problems had had on them .
gante said the government was " willing to work with us on a solution . " airbus has told customers that the double-decker passenger jets , which have nearly completed certification , will be delivered up to two years late , mainly because engineers must learn to use new production software . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany undecided on role in eads in the minefield of national egos at the heart of eads , the german government seems undecided about how best to shore up its interests without being left to foot the bill if the aerospace giant 's finances deteriorate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 08.11.2006 us elections mark new beginning for transatlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german opinion of the united states could change after the midterm election results the democratic party 's victory in us midterm elections has been welcomed across the atlantic .
german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " i think the united states is going to become more protectionist and we will see less approval for international trade agreements , " scherpenberg said .
this could make the world trade organization 's doha round negotiations more difficult , he said . but whether the issues are economic or political , guérot said it had become clear to both sides that everyone had to work together . " europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .
but he said the german parliament would increasingly seek contact to the house , in particular to new congressmen and women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt is the foreign ministry 's transatlantic expert experts agreed that it was important to seek a dialogue to new representatives , in particular as many of them were lacking international experience . " this is an opportunity to develop a new relationship , " voigt said . guérot said european delegations should travel to the united states and us representatives be invited to europe . " what we need to do now is reach out , " she said .
" this way , we can better convey european positions on major international issues and make concerted efforts to find constructive political solutions for the future . " europe will see the united states with new eyes most europeans were crossing their fingers for the democrats in this campaign .
although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states . " the perception of the united states in europe has so far been shaped by the republicans and the american president , " voigt said .
" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said . " if europe perceives that the united states are striving to take on a new tone and a new direction , then public opinion here will turn positive , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .

german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " i think the united states is going to become more protectionist and we will see less approval for international trade agreements , " scherpenberg said .
this could make the world trade organization 's doha round negotiations more difficult , he said . but whether the issues are economic or political , guérot said it had become clear to both sides that everyone had to work together . " europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .
but he said the german parliament would increasingly seek contact to the house , in particular to new congressmen and women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt is the foreign ministry 's transatlantic expert experts agreed that it was important to seek a dialogue to new representatives , in particular as many of them were lacking international experience . " this is an opportunity to develop a new relationship , " voigt said . guérot said european delegations should travel to the united states and us representatives be invited to europe . " what we need to do now is reach out , " she said .
" this way , we can better convey european positions on major international issues and make concerted efforts to find constructive political solutions for the future . " europe will see the united states with new eyes most europeans were crossing their fingers for the democrats in this campaign .
although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states . " the perception of the united states in europe has so far been shaped by the republicans and the american president , " voigt said .
" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said . " if europe perceives that the united states are striving to take on a new tone and a new direction , then public opinion here will turn positive , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .
-lrb- 08.11.2006 -rrb- " i hope an issue like iraq will draw americans to the polls " will tuesday 's elections in the us lead to a democratic congress and republican president ?

a decision by us mail group fedex to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 super-jumbo planes caused massive third-quarter losses at airbus parent eads .
still , airbus expressed confidence in the embattled project . european aircraft maker airbus said tuesday it regretted the decision of us mail group fedex corp. to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 planes but expressed confidence in its beleaguered superjumbo project . production of the a380 - the world 's biggest civilian airliner , which is available as a passenger and cargo plane - has been beset by difficulties .
deliveries are running two years behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once on land , fedex packages are delivered by truck " we regret the decision by fedex but we understand that they had an urgent need for the means to continue their expansion , " said a spokeswoman for airbus . " we think that the a380 freighter will be an excellent plane for the 21st century offering the best performances to its clients , " she added . fedex turns to boeing on wednesday , airbus parent eads said it reported a net loss in the third quarter , a reverse from a profit a year earlier .

it lost 195 million euros -lrb- $ 245 million -rrb- in july-september , from a net profit of euro279 million euros in the year-earlier quarter . on tuesday , fedex express , a unit of fedex , said it had pulled out of an order for 10 freighter versions of the european superjumbo " after airbus announced significant delays in delivery of the a380 . " instead , fedex express said it was buying 15 boeing 777 freighter planes with options to purchase another 15 . airbus has orders for 15 other a380 cargo planes , five from us plane leasing group ilfc and 10 from ups , the us-based rival for fedex . restructuring plan over the past months airbus has repeatedly cited persistent manufacturing problems as the reason for delays .
in response to these problems , the company has announced plans to restructure , cutting the number of its suppliers by more than 80 percent , a spokeswoman confirmed earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantas got some : an airbus a380 passes over sydney harbour the number of suppliers will be reduced " from 3,000 to 500 , " airbus spokeswoman marcella muratore told ap news service .
no further information was available on which suppliers would be dropped or the timetable for the cuts , she said . airbus ' comment confirmed a report in the german financial times deutschland newspaper monday that airbus planned to cut procurement costs by 350 million euros by 2010 ; the report - which cited the employee magazine of airbus parent eads - said the amount of components produced in low-wage countries is to rise by 50 percent . help for suppliers ? meanwhile , the german government may come to the aid of sub-contractors caught out by the airbus crisis , according to two german newsweeklies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus is undertaking a restructuring in response to delivery problems der spiegel and wirtschaftswoche said hans-joachim gante , who heads an industry group , bdli , had written to suppliers during the week saying financial aid was possible if companies were in dire straits or on the verge of bankruptcy . they said the circular had been suggested by the german government , and called for the companies to state the financial impact that the airbus problems had had on them .
gante said the government was " willing to work with us on a solution . " airbus has told customers that the double-decker passenger jets , which have nearly completed certification , will be delivered up to two years late , mainly because engineers must learn to use new production software . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany undecided on role in eads in the minefield of national egos at the heart of eads , the german government seems undecided about how best to shore up its interests without being left to foot the bill if the aerospace giant 's finances deteriorate .

observers said they hoped the us and europe could start healing widening trans-atlantic rifts . political observers in europe said they were hoping that a decisive advance by democrats in the us election could usher in a new era in trans-atlantic cooperation . many of those who saw us president george w. bush get a bloody nose in these elections expect us lawmakers to take a good hard look at us policy in iraq , first and foremost . " europeans would expect some change in policy and possibly also personnel , " said antonio missiroli , chief political analyst of the european policy centre in brussels .
" it is not to be ruled out that … -lrb- us secretary of defense donald -rrb- rumsfeld might go .
and i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " ' end of a nightmare ' the bush administration was widely seen to have alienated europe and much of the rest of the world by its " with us or against us " approach to iraq , alleged human rights abuses at guantanamo bay prison , and its stance on ecological issues – particularly its refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-us sentiment is openly , and frequently , expressed in europe now , it seems bush 's bill has come due , and europeans are openly happy about it . " there is less white house in america now and a little less america in the world , " dominique moisi , special councillor at the french institute of international relations , told reuters news service . " the demise of -lrb- bush 's -rrb- america is good news for all those who love america , " he added . the socialist group in the european parliament , the second-largest bloc following the conservative grouping , hailed the election result , saying bush had been " seriously weakened . " " we are relieved that we now see the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world , " said martin schulz , the president of the 201-strong socialist group . slow change is likely many analysts did not expect democrats to change things too quickly in iraq , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's tony blair was one of few european leaders to stand behind bush " the democrats will make life unpleasant for bush , but they are not going to get much in his way because they do n't want to be tarred by defeat in iraq , " francois heisbourg , a special councillor at the foundation for strategic research in paris told reuters . trade talks may sour observers also worried that trade negotiations currently underway between the us and the european union could take a hit , post-election . " the democratic congress would probably be marginally more protectionist than the current one and this would not bode well for the current negotiations in the wto framework , considering in particular that the ' fast track ' mandate for the bush administration for striking a deal expires in july 2007 , " the european policy center 's missiroli said . bush 's " fast track " negotiating power allows him to authorize trade deals . even britain is glad but such policy concerns did not dampen broad satisfaction in many european capitals , amid continued growing unhappiness over u.s. leadership . even people in washington 's closest european ally , britain , appeared glad to see bush lose his majority in congress . " he 's not the leader he was .
he does n't seem to be making the decisions , there seems to be no sense to what he is doing anymore , " john hayward , a logistics manager in london , told reuters . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .
-lrb- 08.11.2006 -rrb- us elections mark new beginning for transatlantic ties the democratic party 's victory in us midterm elections has been welcomed across the atlantic .

german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .

" europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .

a decision by us mail group fedex to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 super-jumbo planes caused massive third-quarter losses at airbus parent eads .
still , airbus expressed confidence in the embattled project . european aircraft maker airbus said tuesday it regretted the decision of us mail group fedex corp. to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 planes but expressed confidence in its beleaguered superjumbo project . production of the a380 - the world 's biggest civilian airliner , which is available as a passenger and cargo plane - has been beset by difficulties .
deliveries are running two years behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once on land , fedex packages are delivered by truck " we regret the decision by fedex but we understand that they had an urgent need for the means to continue their expansion , " said a spokeswoman for airbus . " we think that the a380 freighter will be an excellent plane for the 21st century offering the best performances to its clients , " she added . fedex turns to boeing on wednesday , airbus parent eads said it reported a net loss in the third quarter , a reverse from a profit a year earlier .
its earnings were hammered by the troubled commercial airplanes division , notably the behind-schedule a380 program , and a weak us dollar , the european aeronautic defence and space co. said .
it lost 195 million euros -lrb- $ 245 million -rrb- in july-september , from a net profit of euro279 million euros in the year-earlier quarter . on tuesday , fedex express , a unit of fedex , said it had pulled out of an order for 10 freighter versions of the european superjumbo " after airbus announced significant delays in delivery of the a380 . " instead , fedex express said it was buying 15 boeing 777 freighter planes with options to purchase another 15 . airbus has orders for 15 other a380 cargo planes , five from us plane leasing group ilfc and 10 from ups , the us-based rival for fedex . restructuring plan over the past months airbus has repeatedly cited persistent manufacturing problems as the reason for delays .
in response to these problems , the company has announced plans to restructure , cutting the number of its suppliers by more than 80 percent , a spokeswoman confirmed earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantas got some : an airbus a380 passes over sydney harbour the number of suppliers will be reduced " from 3,000 to 500 , " airbus spokeswoman marcella muratore told ap news service .
no further information was available on which suppliers would be dropped or the timetable for the cuts , she said . airbus ' comment confirmed a report in the german financial times deutschland newspaper monday that airbus planned to cut procurement costs by 350 million euros by 2010 ; the report - which cited the employee magazine of airbus parent eads - said the amount of components produced in low-wage countries is to rise by 50 percent . help for suppliers ? meanwhile , the german government may come to the aid of sub-contractors caught out by the airbus crisis , according to two german newsweeklies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus is undertaking a restructuring in response to delivery problems der spiegel and wirtschaftswoche said hans-joachim gante , who heads an industry group , bdli , had written to suppliers during the week saying financial aid was possible if companies were in dire straits or on the verge of bankruptcy . they said the circular had been suggested by the german government , and called for the companies to state the financial impact that the airbus problems had had on them .
gante said the government was " willing to work with us on a solution . " airbus has told customers that the double-decker passenger jets , which have nearly completed certification , will be delivered up to two years late , mainly because engineers must learn to use new production software . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany undecided on role in eads in the minefield of national egos at the heart of eads , the german government seems undecided about how best to shore up its interests without being left to foot the bill if the aerospace giant 's finances deteriorate .

a decision by us mail group fedex to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 super-jumbo planes caused massive third-quarter losses at airbus parent eads .
still , airbus expressed confidence in the embattled project . european aircraft maker airbus said tuesday it regretted the decision of us mail group fedex corp. to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 planes but expressed confidence in its beleaguered superjumbo project . production of the a380 - the world 's biggest civilian airliner , which is available as a passenger and cargo plane - has been beset by difficulties .
deliveries are running two years behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once on land , fedex packages are delivered by truck " we regret the decision by fedex but we understand that they had an urgent need for the means to continue their expansion , " said a spokeswoman for airbus . " we think that the a380 freighter will be an excellent plane for the 21st century offering the best performances to its clients , " she added . fedex turns to boeing on wednesday , airbus parent eads said it reported a net loss in the third quarter , a reverse from a profit a year earlier .
its earnings were hammered by the troubled commercial airplanes division , notably the behind-schedule a380 program , and a weak us dollar , the european aeronautic defence and space co. said .
it lost 195 million euros -lrb- $ 245 million -rrb- in july-september , from a net profit of euro279 million euros in the year-earlier quarter . on tuesday , fedex express , a unit of fedex , said it had pulled out of an order for 10 freighter versions of the european superjumbo " after airbus announced significant delays in delivery of the a380 . " instead , fedex express said it was buying 15 boeing 777 freighter planes with options to purchase another 15 . airbus has orders for 15 other a380 cargo planes , five from us plane leasing group ilfc and 10 from ups , the us-based rival for fedex . restructuring plan over the past months airbus has repeatedly cited persistent manufacturing problems as the reason for delays .
in response to these problems , the company has announced plans to restructure , cutting the number of its suppliers by more than 80 percent , a spokeswoman confirmed earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantas got some : an airbus a380 passes over sydney harbour the number of suppliers will be reduced " from 3,000 to 500 , " airbus spokeswoman marcella muratore told ap news service .
no further information was available on which suppliers would be dropped or the timetable for the cuts , she said . airbus ' comment confirmed a report in the german financial times deutschland newspaper monday that airbus planned to cut procurement costs by 350 million euros by 2010 ; the report - which cited the employee magazine of airbus parent eads - said the amount of components produced in low-wage countries is to rise by 50 percent . help for suppliers ? meanwhile , the german government may come to the aid of sub-contractors caught out by the airbus crisis , according to two german newsweeklies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus is undertaking a restructuring in response to delivery problems der spiegel and wirtschaftswoche said hans-joachim gante , who heads an industry group , bdli , had written to suppliers during the week saying financial aid was possible if companies were in dire straits or on the verge of bankruptcy . they said the circular had been suggested by the german government , and called for the companies to state the financial impact that the airbus problems had had on them .
gante said the government was " willing to work with us on a solution . " airbus has told customers that the double-decker passenger jets , which have nearly completed certification , will be delivered up to two years late , mainly because engineers must learn to use new production software . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany undecided on role in eads in the minefield of national egos at the heart of eads , the german government seems undecided about how best to shore up its interests without being left to foot the bill if the aerospace giant 's finances deteriorate .

observers said they hoped the us and europe could start healing widening trans-atlantic rifts . political observers in europe said they were hoping that a decisive advance by democrats in the us election could usher in a new era in trans-atlantic cooperation . many of those who saw us president george w. bush get a bloody nose in these elections expect us lawmakers to take a good hard look at us policy in iraq , first and foremost . " europeans would expect some change in policy and possibly also personnel , " said antonio missiroli , chief political analyst of the european policy centre in brussels .
" it is not to be ruled out that … -lrb- us secretary of defense donald -rrb- rumsfeld might go .
and i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " ' end of a nightmare ' the bush administration was widely seen to have alienated europe and much of the rest of the world by its " with us or against us " approach to iraq , alleged human rights abuses at guantanamo bay prison , and its stance on ecological issues – particularly its refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-us sentiment is openly , and frequently , expressed in europe now , it seems bush 's bill has come due , and europeans are openly happy about it . " there is less white house in america now and a little less america in the world , " dominique moisi , special councillor at the french institute of international relations , told reuters news service . " the demise of -lrb- bush 's -rrb- america is good news for all those who love america , " he added . the socialist group in the european parliament , the second-largest bloc following the conservative grouping , hailed the election result , saying bush had been " seriously weakened . " " we are relieved that we now see the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world , " said martin schulz , the president of the 201-strong socialist group . slow change is likely many analysts did not expect democrats to change things too quickly in iraq , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's tony blair was one of few european leaders to stand behind bush " the democrats will make life unpleasant for bush , but they are not going to get much in his way because they do n't want to be tarred by defeat in iraq , " francois heisbourg , a special councillor at the foundation for strategic research in paris told reuters . trade talks may sour observers also worried that trade negotiations currently underway between the us and the european union could take a hit , post-election . " the democratic congress would probably be marginally more protectionist than the current one and this would not bode well for the current negotiations in the wto framework , considering in particular that the ' fast track ' mandate for the bush administration for striking a deal expires in july 2007 , " the european policy center 's missiroli said . bush 's " fast track " negotiating power allows him to authorize trade deals . even britain is glad but such policy concerns did not dampen broad satisfaction in many european capitals , amid continued growing unhappiness over u.s. leadership . even people in washington 's closest european ally , britain , appeared glad to see bush lose his majority in congress . " he 's not the leader he was .
he does n't seem to be making the decisions , there seems to be no sense to what he is doing anymore , " john hayward , a logistics manager in london , told reuters . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .

the market is expending and the german-born pontifex maximus is jumping on the bandwagon . pope benedict xvi may be a conservative theologian and staunch believer in the catholic dogma , but when it comes to fashion , he is on the cutting edge .
with his penchant for designer sunglasses , padded quilt jackets and exclusive italian footwear , the 79-year-old leader of the catholic church is continuing to attract ecumenical amazement from the world 's leading fashionistas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody can deny that benedict xvi is a man of style what the pope has done to red prada shoes is what the cult us tv series " sex and the city " did to manolo blahniks .
it brought the world of high fashion closer to the common man . if fashion is the new universal language which transcends borders imposed by religion and culture , then papa ratzi - as the former cardinal joseph ratzinger is affectionately called by his adoring fans - is the true herald of sublime color and graceful style .
for a while , gray was the new black .
then black was the new black .
these days - and largely thanks to papal gorgeous footwear - red is the new gray . it should come as no surprise that the time has arrived for an ultimate test of the pope 's celebrity status : an illustrated calendar .
good-bye , sports illustrated !
good-bye victoria 's secret !
hello , vatican uncovered ! a year with the pope the 2007 calendar containing 14 exclusive shots of the 79-year-old roman pontiff and entitled " together - a year with the pope " will appear in italy on nov .
23 together with the catholic weekly famiglia cristiana .
it will cost 5 euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's fashion-conscious swiss guards " this has nothing to do with other calendars , we have our own style and a distinct target , " the magazine 's patrizia brero told dpa .
" our readers would n't have appreciated a calendar featuring television starlets or nude models . " the photographs for this unique glossy calendar were taken over the summer at the pope 's residence in castel gandolfo , south of rome , by photographer giancarlo giuliani .
this is the first time in history that a pope has posed for a photographer . for every copy sold , one euro off the sales price will be donated to a charitable organization for children in rwanda .
the charity was selected by the pope in person . look , ma , it 's a new pope the slogan chosen by famiglia cristiana to sell the calendar - " you 'll see a new pope every day " - remains somewhat puzzling considering that there will be only 14 pictures of the pope in the calendar : one for each month and two on the cover . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to a 2005 poll , benedict xvi and shakira were the world 's most popular photo personalities how will the faithful manage to see a new pope every day is not exactly clear .
those who are expecting embedded high-tech displays , special effects or simple , old-fashioned miracles may end up having their hopes frustrated . seeing a new pope in the same old picture every day will probably require deep religious commitment or , alternatively , a couple of glasses of chianti or pino grigio . it has become tradition in italy for magazines to offer calendars to their readers this time of the year . the world 's best-known calendar is italian .
published since 1964 , the pirelli calendar usually features naked models or liberally undressed celebrities photographed by some of the world 's most famous photographers . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de of politicians , passports and popes germans are known as serious and hard-working people , but the country 's unruly politicians are habitually letting passions and intrigues run rampant .

a man who knows what he likes , he has now caused a stir by apparently switching tailors .

joachim kaps , from the publisher tokyopop , estimates in 2005 the sales of japanese and korean manga in germany was around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 90 million . -rrb- girl power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga character menolly although the majority of manga comics sold in germany are translations of japanese originals , approximately 20 percent of manga were sketched in germany .
young women 18 to 25 drive the market .
while men traditionally sat behind the drawing table , a wave of female artists have cropped up .
teenage girls regularly participate in competitions organized by publishing houses . although exact numbers do n't exist , the rise of young female manga artists began approximately four years ago . " at previous competitions , more than 90 percent of all contributions were from women , while less than 10 percent were drawn by young men , " said marcus tieschky , an organizer of the comic campus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for a manga drawing competition often , young women draw for a female audience while young men create stories for their male peers . " that 's just the way it is , that young women know best what young women want to read , " said 20-year-old artist natalie wormsbecher .
" but people should n't oversimplify . " there are also exceptions , wormsbecher said , even in the german scene .
detta zimmermann , for example , draws adventure history most often read by men , and is very successful . self styled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga figure by anike hage approximately half of the comics drawn by girls have topics from everyday life -lrb- school , friendships or love -rrb- and the other half from fantasy themes -lrb- like angels and demons . -rrb-
with boys , the fantasy themes -lrb- especially technology and science fiction -rrb- outweigh everything else , tieschky said .
the manga scene in germany has more thematic variety than the original japanese comics . " the japanese artists and their work have had paramount influence on -lrb- german -rrb- artists , " said christina gossel , from the tokyopop publishing house .
" but with many -lrb- artists -rrb- , one increasingly sees that with more experience and practice , they are developing their own style . " christina plaka , anike hage and detta zimmermann are three examples , gossel said . franco-belgian , chinese and korean influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga comic by natalie wormsbecher most manga artists get their first drawing itch after exposure to japanese manga .
young artists copy the japanese style .
but later , inspirations from other sources get added . " i do n't have any specific model .
formerly , i was fascinated with satoshi urushihara and often tried to copy that style .
now , i am inspired by various artists , not only manga ones , " said berliner marie sann . the largest influences on german artists come from japanese manga , south korean manhwa and chinese manhua , tieschky said .
novels and films and franco-belgian comics also provide inspiration .
while european comics play a role in the german manga world , traditional us-style comics are rarely present . finding an audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a figure by marie sann the large comics publishers control more than 70 percent of the manga comics sold in stores .
yet there are other options for aspiring artists .
when one of the big three manga publishing firms - tokyopop , carlsen and egmont manga & anime -lrb- ema -rrb- - passes on an artist , there 's always the internet , fanzines and small publishers . the german manga phenomenon 's influence has crossed beyond the world of comics and into popular culture .
it can be seen in videos and magazines which stamp manga as a style choice for 12 to 25 year olds .
merchandizing becomes an additional source of income for the mangakas , as young manga female artists are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga artist anike hage anike hage , author of the popular gothic sports , said she sees the developments in manga as largely positive . " i 'm a little worried when one has to draw for free , because there are so many young artists that demand no or very little money for their work , but always deliver better quality .
i find it good that there are always more fans drawing , because it keeps -lrb- manga -rrb- moving .

however , it will also take ankara to task for the pace with which it is implementing mandatory reforms .
cyprus , already an eu member , remains a nagging issue .
turkey , which claims the divided island as a part of its national territory , has been reluctant to agree to any moves that could imply any recognition by ankara of cypriot sovereignty .
the report also focuses on the slowing pace of turkish reforms in general .
it calls for further efforts to strengthen rights for religious and ethnic minorities , women and trade unions .

finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has reportedly drafted a plan aimed at bringing some movement on the issue of cyprus .
the details are being kept secret at present , but the plan allegedly calls upon turkey to open its ports to ships from cyprus - in accordance with the eu customs union . turkey agreed in 2005 to extend its customs agreements with the original 15 members of the eu to all of the bloc 's newer members , including cyprus .

germany 's social democrat foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , warned against inflaming the situation .
germany , steinmeier said , " had every interest in not escalating the conflict here . " turkish compromise on cyprus would take the heat off the eu and merkel .

observers said they hoped the us and europe could start healing widening trans-atlantic rifts . political observers in europe said they were hoping that a decisive advance by democrats in the us election could usher in a new era in trans-atlantic cooperation . many of those who saw us president george w. bush get a bloody nose in these elections expect us lawmakers to take a good hard look at us policy in iraq , first and foremost . " europeans would expect some change in policy and possibly also personnel , " said antonio missiroli , chief political analyst of the european policy centre in brussels .
" it is not to be ruled out that … -lrb- us secretary of defense donald -rrb- rumsfeld might go .
and i suppose most europeans might welcome a new face and a turning of the page on iraq and the wider middle east . " ' end of a nightmare ' the bush administration was widely seen to have alienated europe and much of the rest of the world by its " with us or against us " approach to iraq , alleged human rights abuses at guantanamo bay prison , and its stance on ecological issues – particularly its refusal to sign the kyoto protocol on global warming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-us sentiment is openly , and frequently , expressed in europe now , it seems bush 's bill has come due , and europeans are openly happy about it . " there is less white house in america now and a little less america in the world , " dominique moisi , special councillor at the french institute of international relations , told reuters news service . " the demise of -lrb- bush 's -rrb- america is good news for all those who love america , " he added . the socialist group in the european parliament , the second-largest bloc following the conservative grouping , hailed the election result , saying bush had been " seriously weakened . " " we are relieved that we now see the beginning of the end of a six-year nightmare for the world , " said martin schulz , the president of the 201-strong socialist group . slow change is likely many analysts did not expect democrats to change things too quickly in iraq , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's tony blair was one of few european leaders to stand behind bush " the democrats will make life unpleasant for bush , but they are not going to get much in his way because they do n't want to be tarred by defeat in iraq , " francois heisbourg , a special councillor at the foundation for strategic research in paris told reuters . trade talks may sour observers also worried that trade negotiations currently underway between the us and the european union could take a hit , post-election . " the democratic congress would probably be marginally more protectionist than the current one and this would not bode well for the current negotiations in the wto framework , considering in particular that the ' fast track ' mandate for the bush administration for striking a deal expires in july 2007 , " the european policy center 's missiroli said . bush 's " fast track " negotiating power allows him to authorize trade deals . even britain is glad but such policy concerns did not dampen broad satisfaction in many european capitals , amid continued growing unhappiness over u.s. leadership . even people in washington 's closest european ally , britain , appeared glad to see bush lose his majority in congress . " he 's not the leader he was .
he does n't seem to be making the decisions , there seems to be no sense to what he is doing anymore , " john hayward , a logistics manager in london , told reuters . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .

a decision by us mail group fedex to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 super-jumbo planes caused massive third-quarter losses at airbus parent eads .
still , airbus expressed confidence in the embattled project . european aircraft maker airbus said tuesday it regretted the decision of us mail group fedex corp. to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 planes but expressed confidence in its beleaguered superjumbo project . production of the a380 - the world 's biggest civilian airliner , which is available as a passenger and cargo plane - has been beset by difficulties .
deliveries are running two years behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once on land , fedex packages are delivered by truck " we regret the decision by fedex but we understand that they had an urgent need for the means to continue their expansion , " said a spokeswoman for airbus . " we think that the a380 freighter will be an excellent plane for the 21st century offering the best performances to its clients , " she added . fedex turns to boeing on wednesday , airbus parent eads said it reported a net loss in the third quarter , a reverse from a profit a year earlier .
its earnings were hammered by the troubled commercial airplanes division , notably the behind-schedule a380 program , and a weak us dollar , the european aeronautic defence and space co. said .
it lost 195 million euros -lrb- $ 245 million -rrb- in july-september , from a net profit of euro279 million euros in the year-earlier quarter . on tuesday , fedex express , a unit of fedex , said it had pulled out of an order for 10 freighter versions of the european superjumbo " after airbus announced significant delays in delivery of the a380 . " instead , fedex express said it was buying 15 boeing 777 freighter planes with options to purchase another 15 . airbus has orders for 15 other a380 cargo planes , five from us plane leasing group ilfc and 10 from ups , the us-based rival for fedex . restructuring plan over the past months airbus has repeatedly cited persistent manufacturing problems as the reason for delays .
in response to these problems , the company has announced plans to restructure , cutting the number of its suppliers by more than 80 percent , a spokeswoman confirmed earlier this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quantas got some : an airbus a380 passes over sydney harbour the number of suppliers will be reduced " from 3,000 to 500 , " airbus spokeswoman marcella muratore told ap news service .
no further information was available on which suppliers would be dropped or the timetable for the cuts , she said . airbus ' comment confirmed a report in the german financial times deutschland newspaper monday that airbus planned to cut procurement costs by 350 million euros by 2010 ; the report - which cited the employee magazine of airbus parent eads - said the amount of components produced in low-wage countries is to rise by 50 percent . help for suppliers ? meanwhile , the german government may come to the aid of sub-contractors caught out by the airbus crisis , according to two german newsweeklies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus is undertaking a restructuring in response to delivery problems der spiegel and wirtschaftswoche said hans-joachim gante , who heads an industry group , bdli , had written to suppliers during the week saying financial aid was possible if companies were in dire straits or on the verge of bankruptcy . they said the circular had been suggested by the german government , and called for the companies to state the financial impact that the airbus problems had had on them .
gante said the government was " willing to work with us on a solution . " airbus has told customers that the double-decker passenger jets , which have nearly completed certification , will be delivered up to two years late , mainly because engineers must learn to use new production software . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany undecided on role in eads in the minefield of national egos at the heart of eads , the german government seems undecided about how best to shore up its interests without being left to foot the bill if the aerospace giant 's finances deteriorate .

german experts expect this political change to improve bilateral relations , both politically and in terms of public opinion . the shift in the balance of power in washington will influence the relationship between the united states and europe , according to experts on transatlantic relations .
while the election results have signaled a new openness in terms of intellectual and political discourse with the us , europe will be watching closely which positions will concretely be taken now . " the democrats will increasingly seek stronger cooperation with the european union and nato , " said karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
" but this will be tied to demands on the europeans in terms of burden sharing . " these would include us calls for greater political involvement in solving the iraq conflict .
however , voigt said he did not expect requests for military support in iraq .
germany could also be asked to expand its deployment in afghanistan from the north to include combat troops in the south , too , voigt said . " but there would be no majority for such a move in german parliament , " voigt said . europe should not anticipate too much from the democratic party 's victory , though , said ulrike guérot , senior transatlantic fellow at the german marshall fund . " europe should be pleased about the clear signal for political change , " guérot said .
" but we should n't expect an immediate turnaround on issues such as iran , iraq or the kyoto protocol . " future us trade policies could impact europe on an economic level , voigt said the united states under a democratic house would also expect more financial support from europe for stabilizing crisis regions . but us domestic economic policy could also put a hole in europe 's pocket .
while the united states has experienced an economic slowdown in the past couple of years , there has been an upward trend in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the democratic majority will change policies on capitol hill the new congress could therefore take a strong stance in terms of trade policies to counteract this development , said jens van scherpenberg , nonresident senior fellow at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " i think the united states is going to become more protectionist and we will see less approval for international trade agreements , " scherpenberg said .
this could make the world trade organization 's doha round negotiations more difficult , he said . but whether the issues are economic or political , guérot said it had become clear to both sides that everyone had to work together . " europe wants to be involved , but ca n't do so on its own , " she said .
there is european interest in a dialogue and this election had provided the necessary platform to conduct it . europe needs to " reach out " voigt said us president george w. bush continued to be the most important and decisive contact for the german government .
but he said the german parliament would increasingly seek contact to the house , in particular to new congressmen and women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt is the foreign ministry 's transatlantic expert experts agreed that it was important to seek a dialogue to new representatives , in particular as many of them were lacking international experience . " this is an opportunity to develop a new relationship , " voigt said . guérot said european delegations should travel to the united states and us representatives be invited to europe . " what we need to do now is reach out , " she said .
" this way , we can better convey european positions on major international issues and make concerted efforts to find constructive political solutions for the future . " europe will see the united states with new eyes most europeans were crossing their fingers for the democrats in this campaign .
although european empathy with the united states following the september 11 terrorist attacks was great , public opinion of the subsequent us-led war on terror and the iraq war has been critical across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush was not greeted warmly during his 2005 visit to germany experts agreed that the political change was an opportunity to reverse this negative image of the united states . " the perception of the united states in europe has so far been shaped by the republicans and the american president , " voigt said .
" this election could show europeans that american society is much more manifold than it is perceived to be here . " it also demonstrated that the opposition towards president bush was just as strong in the united states as in europe , scherpenberg said .
in addition , the election results alleviated european fears that large parts of the united states were drifting into a fundamental christian course . " the secular united states is still very much alive , " scherpenberg said . but the united states now had to prove that a new political debate will follow the democratic party 's gains , guérot said . " if europe perceives that the united states are striving to take on a new tone and a new direction , then public opinion here will turn positive , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu sees opportunities in us democratic win at polls europe is following the us mid-term polls where democrats who swept republicans from power in the house of representatives and gained seats in the senate may push for a change in foreign policy , particularly iraq .

the creators of manga heroes are often as young as their readers - and are , increasingly , young women . here 's a normal scene during a book fair in germany : young people have dressed themselves in colorful , whimsical clothes and layered on the makeup .
they 're engaged in " costume play " to get under the skin of manga heroes and interact with the comic world . the manga scene in germany is more than just a style phenomenon .
the japanese comics are big business .
joachim kaps , from the publisher tokyopop , estimates in 2005 the sales of japanese and korean manga in germany was around 70 million euros -lrb- $ 90 million . -rrb- girl power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga character menolly although the majority of manga comics sold in germany are translations of japanese originals , approximately 20 percent of manga were sketched in germany .
young women 18 to 25 drive the market .
while men traditionally sat behind the drawing table , a wave of female artists have cropped up .
teenage girls regularly participate in competitions organized by publishing houses . although exact numbers do n't exist , the rise of young female manga artists began approximately four years ago . " at previous competitions , more than 90 percent of all contributions were from women , while less than 10 percent were drawn by young men , " said marcus tieschky , an organizer of the comic campus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for a manga drawing competition often , young women draw for a female audience while young men create stories for their male peers . " that 's just the way it is , that young women know best what young women want to read , " said 20-year-old artist natalie wormsbecher .
" but people should n't oversimplify . " there are also exceptions , wormsbecher said , even in the german scene .
detta zimmermann , for example , draws adventure history most often read by men , and is very successful . self styled bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga figure by anike hage approximately half of the comics drawn by girls have topics from everyday life -lrb- school , friendships or love -rrb- and the other half from fantasy themes -lrb- like angels and demons . -rrb-
with boys , the fantasy themes -lrb- especially technology and science fiction -rrb- outweigh everything else , tieschky said .
the manga scene in germany has more thematic variety than the original japanese comics . " the japanese artists and their work have had paramount influence on -lrb- german -rrb- artists , " said christina gossel , from the tokyopop publishing house .
" but with many -lrb- artists -rrb- , one increasingly sees that with more experience and practice , they are developing their own style . " christina plaka , anike hage and detta zimmermann are three examples , gossel said . franco-belgian , chinese and korean influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga comic by natalie wormsbecher most manga artists get their first drawing itch after exposure to japanese manga .
young artists copy the japanese style .
but later , inspirations from other sources get added . " i do n't have any specific model .
formerly , i was fascinated with satoshi urushihara and often tried to copy that style .
now , i am inspired by various artists , not only manga ones , " said berliner marie sann . the largest influences on german artists come from japanese manga , south korean manhwa and chinese manhua , tieschky said .
novels and films and franco-belgian comics also provide inspiration .
while european comics play a role in the german manga world , traditional us-style comics are rarely present . finding an audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a figure by marie sann the large comics publishers control more than 70 percent of the manga comics sold in stores .
yet there are other options for aspiring artists .
when one of the big three manga publishing firms - tokyopop , carlsen and egmont manga & anime -lrb- ema -rrb- - passes on an artist , there 's always the internet , fanzines and small publishers . the german manga phenomenon 's influence has crossed beyond the world of comics and into popular culture .
it can be seen in videos and magazines which stamp manga as a style choice for 12 to 25 year olds .
merchandizing becomes an additional source of income for the mangakas , as young manga female artists are called . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manga artist anike hage anike hage , author of the popular gothic sports , said she sees the developments in manga as largely positive . " i 'm a little worried when one has to draw for free , because there are so many young artists that demand no or very little money for their work , but always deliver better quality .
i find it good that there are always more fans drawing , because it keeps -lrb- manga -rrb- moving .

lord goldsmith said it would be wrong to do so , despite his closeness to tony blair , who is expected to face police questions during the inquiry .
but he said he would take independent advice on whether to prosecute .
it came as police and the treasury refused to comment on claims chancellor gordon brown would also face questions .
the daily telegraph said mr brown , deputy prime minister john prescott and other senior cabinet ministers would all be questioned as witnesses .
labour officials pointed out early on that mr brown , because of his role as chancellor , had taken no role in party funding .
dual role as head of prosecutions , the attorney general is usually consulted by the crown prosecution service on decisions to prosecute in high-profile and complex cases .
we will see whether this will silence the critics bbc political editor nick robinson read nick 's thoughts in full he gives formal consent to proceedings for certain offences , including corruption , where he determines whether it is in the public interest .
but lord goldsmith has come under pressure from opposition parties to stand aside from his normal role in the " cash for honours " row , as they say he is too close to the prime minister and the government to rule himself out of involvement .
director of public prosecutions ken macdonald - a former colleague of cherie blair - and metropolitan police commissioner sir ian blair , have decided to stand aside from decisions related to the investigation .
but , in a letter to shadow attorney general dominic grieve , lord goldsmith said : " there have been suggestions that i should stand aside from any involvement in this case .
however , it would not be right for me to do that . "
he said the need for his consent in certain cases was an " essential legal condition " and could not be avoided .
but he added : " if the cps consult me on a prosecution in this case , i propose that my office should appoint independent senior counsel to review all the relevant material and advise on any prosecutions . "
demands for clarity if a decision was taken not to prosecute , he would make sure the reasons were explained to " give greater confidence in the objectivity and impartiality of any decision " , he added .
police are investigating whether people have been nominated for honours in exchange for giving donations or loans to political parties .
no-one has been charged but a large number of people have been questioned by police .
all those involved have denied any wrongdoing .
justice can only be done and be seen to be done if nobody with a political role plays any decisive part in any investigation , charge or trial .
simon hughes lib dems mr grieve told the bbc he was satisfied with the letter he had received from lord goldsmith .
he accepted the attorney general could not abandon his constitutional responsibility but said he could offer reassurances the matter would be dealt with " through advice of an impartial and distinguished , senior lawyer " .
he added : " i 'm satisfied with that answer and it 's the answer which i expected to get " for the liberal democrats , simon hughes said it was a " step in the right direction " but was not " clean cut " enough .
he said lord goldsmith 's role should be no more than to formally confirm the advice of independent counsel .
he said : " the cash for peerages investigations go to the heart of the integrity of government .
" justice can only be done and be seen to be done if nobody with a political role plays any decisive part in any investigation , charge or trial . "
snp mp angus macneil , whose complaint to police sparked the cash-for-honours inquiry , said the letter was " a fudge " and " not good enough " .

the elections are called mid-terms because they come half-way through the four-year term served by the president , though the polls are in fact for congress - the two houses of the us legislature .
this time , there were also races for 36 of the 50 state governorships , known as gubernatorial elections .
in congress , all 435 members of the house of representatives faced the voters , as they do every two years .
but only a third of the 100 members of the senate are up for election at any one time .
that translated into 33 seats this year .
why not elect everybody at the same time ?
the american system is designed to be overlapping , both in terms of the powers of the different bodies and in terms of when people are elected to them .
the house of representatives is the larger of the two houses of congress .
it was set up as a popular body with the number of members tied to the size of the population .
the idea was for it to directly and quickly reflect the public mood , which is why the members face election every two years .
the senate was planned as a more reflective body , and each state has two senators regardless of its size .
senators serve for six years .
every two years , one third of them face re-election .
why are the mid-terms important ?
at stake was control of congress , the legislative branch of the us government .
republicans had controlled both chambers since 1994 , except for a brief time when democrats held the senate .
is incumbency a big factor ?
like incumbent presidents , sitting members of the two houses stand a strong chance of re-election and there are no federal limits on length of tenure .
robert carlyle byrd -lrb- democrat -rrb- , for example , has been a senator in west virginia since 1958 , while the traditional re-election rate for house of representatives members is more than 90 % .
apart from the advantage of voter recognition , incumbents across the parties appear to enjoy a clear fundraising advantage .
sitting members of the house of representatives net more campaign funds than their challengers by a factor of 7:2 while senators have a 4:1 advantage , according to the non-partisan center for responsive politics .
business interests account for about three-quarters of all contributions , the centre says .

robert carlyle byrd -lrb- democrat -rrb- , for example , has been a senator in west virginia since 1958 , while the traditional re-election rate for house of representatives members is more than 90 % .
apart from the advantage of voter recognition , incumbents across the parties appear to enjoy a clear fundraising advantage .
sitting members of the house of representatives net more campaign funds than their challengers by a factor of 7:2 while senators have a 4:1 advantage , according to the non-partisan center for responsive politics .
business interests account for about three-quarters of all contributions , the centre says .

the elections are called mid-terms because they come half-way through the four-year term served by the president , though the polls are in fact for congress - the two houses of the us legislature .
this time , there were also races for 36 of the 50 state governorships , known as gubernatorial elections .
in congress , all 435 members of the house of representatives faced the voters , as they do every two years .
but only a third of the 100 members of the senate are up for election at any one time .
that translated into 33 seats this year .
why not elect everybody at the same time ?
the american system is designed to be overlapping , both in terms of the powers of the different bodies and in terms of when people are elected to them .
the house of representatives is the larger of the two houses of congress .
it was set up as a popular body with the number of members tied to the size of the population .
the idea was for it to directly and quickly reflect the public mood , which is why the members face election every two years .
the senate was planned as a more reflective body , and each state has two senators regardless of its size .
senators serve for six years .
every two years , one third of them face re-election .
why are the mid-terms important ?
at stake was control of congress , the legislative branch of the us government .
republicans had controlled both chambers since 1994 , except for a brief time when democrats held the senate .
is incumbency a big factor ?
like incumbent presidents , sitting members of the two houses stand a strong chance of re-election and there are no federal limits on length of tenure .

brief outburst of joy there are a lot of tired faces around the office , after a long weekend of broadcasting .
it was one of the landmark moments since the invasion .
but there is no sense of that now .
while the world outside is still excited about the verdict on the former iraqi leader and we field relentless calls from london for more coverage , here in baghdad it feels more like a collective depression has set in .
there are no more celebrations - even in sadr city , that bastion of anti-saddam feeling .
the main concern is getting provisions in , with the curfew in force for a second day .
the water has stopped working again - in those areas that have it .
several big thumping bangs have shaken the city , rattling our windows .
us warplanes have been roaring overhead .
the cold hard reality of iraq three-and-a-half years since the us and british invasion has quickly re-asserted itself .
one moment will stay in my memory .
i was broadcasting live from the roof of our office .
we already knew saddam hussein had been sentenced to death and had reported it .
but no one outside had seen the moment on television - because the court releases the footage on a 20-minute delay .
the presenter in london told me the pictures were coming up .
" let 's watch " .
iraqi television channels were receiving them at the same time .
i heard the familiar voice of the judge , then saddam hussein : " long live the people , down with the traitors , down with the invaders , allahu akbar , god is great . "
" from our roof , i watched a man in a striped orange shirt enthusiastically pump rounds into the air .
soon the sound of gunfire echoed around us " within seconds , it began .
bang , crack , bang , crack .
some people must have had their kalashnikovs ready in their hands .
from our roof , i watched a man in a striped orange shirt enthusiastically pumping rounds into the air with his ak .
another man joined him .
soon , the sound of gunfire was echoing around us .
we moved our broadcasting point under cover and got flak jackets on .
you never know where all that flying metal will land .
but 20 minutes later , we were back in our normal spot .
and although many people poured on to the streets in sadr city and other shia areas of the country , the jubilation did n't last long .
i remember being in sadr city in april 2003 - or saddam city as it then still was - two days after his statue was pulled down and the celebratory gunfire was still going on through the night .
sombre mood there were clues to the mood beforehand .
we toured some cafes and restaurants last weekend , to gather material for pieces to preview the verdict .
" no question he should be executed , " said baghdad university professor jawad ali .
" he 's already executed a quarter of the iraqi people . "
but he added : " the case has nothing to do with now .
it wo n't make any difference . "
he was sitting with his family eating ice-cream under a yellow awning .
it was n't safe being out , he said , but they could n't stay at home all the time .
at the next cafe we come to , a tough-looking businessman puffing on a water pipe told me the trial had made the former leader a hero .
" every time we see saddam hussein on television , we want him back .
if you had a vote , most iraqis would say that now . "
wishful thinking , i thought , from a man who did n't appear to have suffered much under the old regime .
he paused to suck on his pipe , then said calmly : " saddam killed some of my relatives too .
but we had security then . "
as we were leaving , an older man came up to me .
he 'd been listening to our conversation .
" listen , " he said , " all the politicians in iraq now are not worth one of saddam hussein 's shoes . "
memories of life under his regime are short it seems .
but they 've been made so by the violent chaos of today and every sign things will get worse .
living on hope we drove down the road and our eyes were drawn to a very new-looking , brightly lit restaurant with a big glass-fronted atrium .
it shouts of courage and defiance .
but it also looks like a prime target .
so i wo n't name the place or say where it is .
there was a mix of arabic and western food on the menu .
one fairly wealthy-looking family was tucking into pizza , while at the next table a woman and her brother and father were choosing from a spread of tabouleh , hummos , salads and shish tawook - grilled chicken pieces . "
when i 'm at home and the telephone rings , every time i think : ' that 's a bomb at my restaurant " ' baghdad restaurant owner " yes , " the owner admitted , " my friends say i 'm crazy to put my money into this restaurant now . "
he only opened it seven months ago .
" no , it 's not safe here , " the woman agrees , gesturing out of the big windows to the street outside .
" but we ca n't stay at home all the time .
what can you do ? " she says mournfully , picking at her food .
" i 'm afraid for my family all the time , " the owner told me .
" when i 'm at home and the telephone rings , every time i think : ' that 's a bomb at my restaurant ' . "
but he turned the conversation to me : " what are you doing here ?
you should take care of yourself . "
everyone is living on hope , that it wo n't be their turn next .
" when saddam went , we lost security , " the owner went on .
" we had many problems then and we have more freedom now .
but if you lose security , freedom is n't worth much . "
but you know , this is my country .
i ca n't leave . "
" i hope you come back to my restaurant " , he said as we were leaving .
" we do takeaway .
here , have one of our menus . "

brief outburst of joy there are a lot of tired faces around the office , after a long weekend of broadcasting .
it was one of the landmark moments since the invasion .
weapons were at the ready for the verdict , but celebrations were hollow but there is no sense of that now .
while the world outside is still excited about the verdict on the former iraqi leader and we field relentless calls from london for more coverage , here in baghdad it feels more like a collective depression has set in .
there are no more celebrations - even in sadr city , that bastion of anti-saddam feeling .
the main concern is getting provisions in , with the curfew in force for a second day .
the water has stopped working again - in those areas that have it .
several big thumping bangs have shaken the city , rattling our windows .
us warplanes have been roaring overhead .
the cold hard reality of iraq three-and-a-half years since the us and british invasion has quickly re-asserted itself .
one moment will stay in my memory .
i was broadcasting live from the roof of our office .
we already knew saddam hussein had been sentenced to death and had reported it .
but no one outside had seen the moment on television - because the court releases the footage on a 20-minute delay .
the presenter in london told me the pictures were coming up .
" let 's watch " .
iraqi television channels were receiving them at the same time .
i heard the familiar voice of the judge , then saddam hussein : " long live the people , down with the traitors , down with the invaders , allahu akbar , god is great . "
from our roof , i watched a man in a striped orange shirt enthusiastically pump rounds into the air .
soon the sound of gunfire echoed around us within seconds , it began .
bang , crack , bang , crack .
some people must have had their kalashnikovs ready in their hands .
from our roof , i watched a man in a striped orange shirt enthusiastically pumping rounds into the air with his ak .
another man joined him .
soon , the sound of gunfire was echoing around us .
we moved our broadcasting point under cover and got flak jackets on .
you never know where all that flying metal will land .
but 20 minutes later , we were back in our normal spot .
and although many people poured on to the streets in sadr city and other shia areas of the country , the jubilation did n't last long .
i remember being in sadr city in april 2003 - or saddam city as it then still was - two days after his statue was pulled down and the celebratory gunfire was still going on through the night .
sombre mood there were clues to the mood beforehand .
we toured some cafes and restaurants last weekend , to gather material for pieces to preview the verdict .
" no question he should be executed , " said baghdad university professor jawad ali .
" he 's already executed a quarter of the iraqi people . "
but he added : " the case has nothing to do with now .
it wo n't make any difference . "
it is not safe to go out , but nor do people want to stay at home all day he was sitting with his family eating ice-cream under a yellow awning .
it was n't safe being out , he said , but they could n't stay at home all the time .
at the next cafe we come to , a tough-looking businessman puffing on a water pipe told me the trial had made the former leader a hero .
" every time we see saddam hussein on television , we want him back .
if you had a vote , most iraqis would say that now . "
wishful thinking , i thought , from a man who did n't appear to have suffered much under the old regime .
he paused to suck on his pipe , then said calmly : " saddam killed some of my relatives too .
but we had security then . "
as we were leaving , an older man came up to me .
he 'd been listening to our conversation .
" listen , " he said , " all the politicians in iraq now are not worth one of saddam hussein 's shoes . "
memories of life under his regime are short it seems .
but they 've been made so by the violent chaos of today and every sign things will get worse .
living on hope we drove down the road and our eyes were drawn to a very new-looking , brightly lit restaurant with a big glass-fronted atrium .
it shouts of courage and defiance .
but it also looks like a prime target .
so i wo n't name the place or say where it is .
there was a mix of arabic and western food on the menu .
one fairly wealthy-looking family was tucking into pizza , while at the next table a woman and her brother and father were choosing from a spread of tabouleh , hummos , salads and shish tawook - grilled chicken pieces .
when i 'm at home and the telephone rings , every time i think : ' that 's a bomb at my restaurant ' baghdad restaurant owner " yes , " the owner admitted , " my friends say i 'm crazy to put my money into this restaurant now . "
he only opened it seven months ago .
" no , it 's not safe here , " the woman agrees , gesturing out of the big windows to the street outside .
" but we ca n't stay at home all the time .
what can you do ? " she says mournfully , picking at her food .
" i 'm afraid for my family all the time , " the owner told me .

brief outburst of joy there are a lot of tired faces around the office , after a long weekend of broadcasting .
it was one of the landmark moments since the invasion .
weapons were at the ready for the verdict , but celebrations were hollow but there is no sense of that now .
while the world outside is still excited about the verdict on the former iraqi leader and we field relentless calls from london for more coverage , here in baghdad it feels more like a collective depression has set in .
there are no more celebrations - even in sadr city , that bastion of anti-saddam feeling .
the main concern is getting provisions in , with the curfew in force for a second day .
the water has stopped working again - in those areas that have it .
several big thumping bangs have shaken the city , rattling our windows .
us warplanes have been roaring overhead .
the cold hard reality of iraq three-and-a-half years since the us and british invasion has quickly re-asserted itself .
one moment will stay in my memory .
i was broadcasting live from the roof of our office .
we already knew saddam hussein had been sentenced to death and had reported it .
but no one outside had seen the moment on television - because the court releases the footage on a 20-minute delay .
the presenter in london told me the pictures were coming up .
" let 's watch " .
iraqi television channels were receiving them at the same time .
i heard the familiar voice of the judge , then saddam hussein : " long live the people , down with the traitors , down with the invaders , allahu akbar , god is great . "
from our roof , i watched a man in a striped orange shirt enthusiastically pump rounds into the air .
soon the sound of gunfire echoed around us within seconds , it began .
bang , crack , bang , crack .
some people must have had their kalashnikovs ready in their hands .
from our roof , i watched a man in a striped orange shirt enthusiastically pumping rounds into the air with his ak .
another man joined him .
soon , the sound of gunfire was echoing around us .
we moved our broadcasting point under cover and got flak jackets on .
you never know where all that flying metal will land .
but 20 minutes later , we were back in our normal spot .
and although many people poured on to the streets in sadr city and other shia areas of the country , the jubilation did n't last long .
i remember being in sadr city in april 2003 - or saddam city as it then still was - two days after his statue was pulled down and the celebratory gunfire was still going on through the night .
sombre mood there were clues to the mood beforehand .
we toured some cafes and restaurants last weekend , to gather material for pieces to preview the verdict .
" no question he should be executed , " said baghdad university professor jawad ali .
" he 's already executed a quarter of the iraqi people . "
but he added : " the case has nothing to do with now .
it wo n't make any difference . "
it is not safe to go out , but nor do people want to stay at home all day he was sitting with his family eating ice-cream under a yellow awning .
it was n't safe being out , he said , but they could n't stay at home all the time .
at the next cafe we come to , a tough-looking businessman puffing on a water pipe told me the trial had made the former leader a hero .
" every time we see saddam hussein on television , we want him back .
if you had a vote , most iraqis would say that now . "
wishful thinking , i thought , from a man who did n't appear to have suffered much under the old regime .
he paused to suck on his pipe , then said calmly : " saddam killed some of my relatives too .

soon , the sound of gunfire was echoing around us .
we moved our broadcasting point under cover and got flak jackets on .
you never know where all that flying metal will land .
but 20 minutes later , we were back in our normal spot .
and although many people poured on to the streets in sadr city and other shia areas of the country , the jubilation did n't last long .
i remember being in sadr city in april 2003 - or saddam city as it then still was - two days after his statue was pulled down and the celebratory gunfire was still going on through the night .
sombre mood there were clues to the mood beforehand .
we toured some cafes and restaurants last weekend , to gather material for pieces to preview the verdict .
" no question he should be executed , " said baghdad university professor jawad ali .
" he 's already executed a quarter of the iraqi people . "
but he added : " the case has nothing to do with now .
it wo n't make any difference . "
it is not safe to go out , but nor do people want to stay at home all day he was sitting with his family eating ice-cream under a yellow awning .
it was n't safe being out , he said , but they could n't stay at home all the time .
at the next cafe we come to , a tough-looking businessman puffing on a water pipe told me the trial had made the former leader a hero .
" every time we see saddam hussein on television , we want him back .
if you had a vote , most iraqis would say that now . "
wishful thinking , i thought , from a man who did n't appear to have suffered much under the old regime .
he paused to suck on his pipe , then said calmly : " saddam killed some of my relatives too .
but we had security then . "
as we were leaving , an older man came up to me .
he 'd been listening to our conversation .
" listen , " he said , " all the politicians in iraq now are not worth one of saddam hussein 's shoes . "
memories of life under his regime are short it seems .
but they 've been made so by the violent chaos of today and every sign things will get worse .
living on hope we drove down the road and our eyes were drawn to a very new-looking , brightly lit restaurant with a big glass-fronted atrium .
it shouts of courage and defiance .
but it also looks like a prime target .
so i wo n't name the place or say where it is .
there was a mix of arabic and western food on the menu .
one fairly wealthy-looking family was tucking into pizza , while at the next table a woman and her brother and father were choosing from a spread of tabouleh , hummos , salads and shish tawook - grilled chicken pieces .
when i 'm at home and the telephone rings , every time i think : ' that 's a bomb at my restaurant ' baghdad restaurant owner " yes , " the owner admitted , " my friends say i 'm crazy to put my money into this restaurant now . "
he only opened it seven months ago .
" no , it 's not safe here , " the woman agrees , gesturing out of the big windows to the street outside .
" but we ca n't stay at home all the time .
what can you do ? " she says mournfully , picking at her food .
" i 'm afraid for my family all the time , " the owner told me .
" when i 'm at home and the telephone rings , every time i think : ' that 's a bomb at my restaurant ' . "
but he turned the conversation to me : " what are you doing here ?
you should take care of yourself . "
everyone is living on hope , that it wo n't be their turn next .
" when saddam went , we lost security , " the owner went on .
" we had many problems then and we have more freedom now .
but if you lose security , freedom is n't worth much . "
but you know , this is my country .
i ca n't leave . "
" i hope you come back to my restaurant " , he said as we were leaving .
" we do takeaway .
here , have one of our menus . "

wreaths will be laid off the west wales coast near where ieuan bateman 's body was recovered after the rescue in 1956 .
the 21-year-old was on the st david 's lifeboat swn-y-mor which saved eight trawlermen off skokholm island .
he was washed overboard on the way back to shore and given a posthumous award by the french government .
his close relatives , including his brothers john and byron , will attend the service 50 years to the day that he died .
john bateman said : " in those days you joined the lifeboat when you were 15 and then you made your way up on to the crew .
it was unusual for car lights to come down to our little cottage ... it was the police and the head launcher to tell us that that my brother was missing john bateman , brother " i remember i was on my home from school when the maroons went off .
it was really bad conditions . "
the trawler - notre dame de fatima - had sent a distress signal about 4.5 miles from skokholm .
the lifeboat crew were able to remove all of its crew .
" when my father came home we went down to the station and stayed there until we were told the lifeboat had taken off eight survivors and was headed back to milford . "
the family returned to their farmhouse believing his brother was safe and went to bed .
mr bateman 's brothers and crew members will take part in the service " it was unusual for car lights to come down to our little cottage in the early hours of the morning but it was the police and the head launcher to tell us that that my brother was missing , " he added .
his body was recovered two days later at west dale bay .
france posthumously awarded ieuan bateman its lifesaving silver medal and he was also recognised by the french lifeboat society .
despite the tragedy his three younger brothers were not put off joining the lifeboat crew at st david 's and have completed more than 100 years of service between them .
john bateman said wednesday would be an emotional day for his family .
" in st david 's we are never short of crew - it 's saving lives and doing something for the community . "

police have stopped and issued 532 fixed penalty notices to drivers who did not have a valid reason to be in the " turning point " zone .
traffic restrictions have been put in place around the city centre as part of an £ 11m improvement plan .
a council survey said the scheme , which includes the use of cctv cameras , was cutting city congestion by up to 90 % .
fine warning councillor brian grocock from nottingham city council said : " this shows just how successful the turning point has been at reducing traffic in central areas , even before the scheme is completely finished .
" such a reduction in congestion justifies our belief that the scheme would have a dramatic and positive effect - and bus users and pedestrians in particular will have already felt the benefits , " he said .
the city council has warned people they could be given a £ 30 fine , even if they 're not stopped by police .
the scheme is being trialled for 18 months and non-essential traffic has been banned from milton street and a stretch of parliament street since july .

but as the night wore on it got more difficult .
" we 're not breaking out the champagne bottles yet , " he said when he spoke before cheering supporters at the democrats ' victory celebration in washington .
but by the time hillary clinton crushed her opponent in new york state to win another term in the senate , there was a real sense among democrats that they had broken through .
" when i return to washington next week , i do so knowing that we have made a statement here tonight , that we believe in who we are as a state and we believe in our country , " senator clinton said .
" and we are going to take it back starting tonight , so to all of you - thank you , god bless you , god bless new york and god bless america . "
' change on iraq ' moments after mrs clinton spoke , her boss harry reid - the democratic leader in the senate - summed up what the victory in the house of representatives would mean .
" all over america tonight they have come to the conclusion - as we did some time ago - that a one-party town just simply does n't work , " he said .
" america has come to the conclusion - as we did months ago - that we must change direction in iraq . "
again and again democrats have been mentioning iraq and mentioning change .
nancy pelosi , who looks likely to become the new speaker of the house of representatives , said the current path had been catastrophic .
but she made it clear that she would be looking for solutions , not scalps .
" democrats are ready to lead , " she said .
" we are prepared to govern and we will do so working together with the administration and the republicans in congress in partnership - not in partisanship . "
new powers for democrats for president bush , the loss of the house of representatives is a big blow .
he will speak later on wednesday , but republican party chairman ken mehlman has already appeared to suggest that some element of bipartisan compromise was on the cards once the dust had settled .
" i think what we 've got to do is to continue to work , recommit ourselves to the principles we believe in , and try to work in a bipartisan basis to accomplish those principles , " he said .
for the white house , the bleak fact is that majority status in the house of representatives gives the democrats the chairmanship of every committee - giving them the power to hold hearings and the power to initiate legislation .
what will they do with that platform ?
will they try , for instance , to impeach the president ?
or will they stick to ms pelosi 's stated goal of leadership ?
probably the latter .
many of the new intake are moderate democrats , conservatives even , who are not looking for an ideological fight .
' looking for leaders ' one of the stars of the democratic firmament , the mixed-race senator barack obama , put it like this : " the critical message in this election is going to be that the american people are in a serious mood .
" they recognise the challenges that we face , and they are hopeful that the democrats can provide some leadership that 's been lacking from the other side , both in congress and the white house . "
meanwhile , what of the senate ?
incredibly , we do not know who is going to be in control .
it will probably come down to one state - virginia - where recounts and litigation could go on for weeks .

by nick triggle health reporter , bbc news thousands have protested against nhs cuts perhaps fearful of the treatment james callaghan received nearly 30 years ago , ministers have avoided shrugging off nhs critics with the words " crisis ?
what crisis ? "
but only just .
hospitals may be facing up to the prospect of closing key services , but it is nothing to do with deficits , ministers say .
instead , health secretary patricia hewitt and her team have been claiming it is all part of some grand plan .
they point out the government has already set out a vision to move more care into the community so it is only natural the hospitals of the future will need to be smaller .
health minister andy burnham even said rather than putting the nhs under threat , the events were unfolding to allow the health service to make " one of its biggest leaps forward in its history " .
rally but , as the hundreds of people who marched through central london and attended a rally a stones throw from parliament last week shows , not everyone is convinced .
one of the main criticisms is that the extra community services promised are not yet in place .
among the demonstrators last week were staff and patients from north staffordshire .
they say the situation there is symbolic of what is happneing elsewhere .
changing times up to 60 hospitals are expected to carry out reviews which could lead to emergency care being centralised at super regional centres , while general services such as outpatient care are hived off to the community sector the government has pledged £ 750m over five years for community schemes such home chemotherapy and a new generation of community hospitals some 3,000 gp premises will be refurbished or replaced by 2008 , while 750 multi-disciplinary health centres will open the university hospital of north staffordshire nhs trust has responded to the mounting £ 15m deficit by announcing over 1,000 jobs will go along with 160 beds and thousands of outpatient appointments .
the plan put forward by hospital bosses says community services will pick up the slack .
but out in the community , staff and public see it very differently .
one of the key policies in moving care into the community - as set out in a government white paper in january - is practice-based commissioning .
the scheme offers gps budgets to set up specialist services such as dermatology and asthma clinics - just the sort of services provide on an outpatient basis by many hospitals .
however , dr prasad rao , a local gp , said few doctors had got such schemes up and running yet .
" i just do not see that there will be sufficient services in place to cope with the extra burden .
the government needs to invest more . "
struggling andy bentley , of north staffs nhs sos campaign group , said : " it is like a double whammy really .
we are losing services and staff at the hospitals , while community services are struggling .
" there are no new doctors , nurses or health visitors to take on this extra work , so it will mean the patient suffers . "
north staffordshire pct , which is in charge of paying for community services , is facing a £ 1.4m deficit and while it is not large in nhs terms it has meant there has been limited money for investment .
pcts , especially those with funding deficit , will probably be finding it hard to invest in new services anna dixon , of the king 's fund a spokesman said they had not received any extra money so it had been unable to increase the staff numbers with the exception of two teams of community matrons who were taken on a year ago .
" we have had to start working more innovatively .
we have started doing blood tests in the community and things like that . "
alex nunns , of the keep our nhs public campaign group , believes the government is using the white paper aims as an excuse for the hospital cuts .
" the community services are not in place - and in the cases of many community hospitals are even fighting for their survivial - and yet hospitals are being hit all over the country .
complaints " this is going to leave tremendous gaps in patient care . "
the department of health dismisses such suggestions , pointing out it has already pledged £ 750m over the next five years for community services from home chemotherapy to a new generation of cottage hospitals - although this money has still not been allocated despite hospitals already being scaled down .
officials also pointed out 3,000 gp premises will have been replaced or refurbished and 750 new health centres opened by 2008 - through a combination of private and public funding .
whole communities have been mobilised a spokesman for the department of health added : " the nhs has never witnessed such a sustained investment in community hospitals , modern gp surgeries and one-stop health centres . "
but anna dixon , deputy director of policy at the king 's fund health think-tank , suggested the critics had some grounds for their complaints .
she said the hospital reviews were not just being driven by deficits as the move to provide care in the community was part of a long-term plan .
but she said there was a " genuine concern " over whether the community services will be in place to cope with the extra burden from hospital reconfigurations .
" pcts , especially those with funding deficit , will probably be finding it hard to invest in new services .
" there is likely to be a gap between the disinvestment in acute care and the investment in community services . "
