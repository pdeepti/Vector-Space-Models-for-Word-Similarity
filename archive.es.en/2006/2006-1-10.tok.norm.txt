eu officials condemned the move and said counter-steps would have to be discussed . " today , with the authorization given by the iaea to its inspectors -lrb- to supervise the action -rrb- ... seals from a number of research centers were removed , " said mohammad saidi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency said , referring to the international atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran 's nuclear research reactor at the iran 's atomic energy organization 's headquarters " as of today these centers resume their activities , " saidi told reporters .
" the research will be carried out in all the centers that we told the iaea about , and we will restart our work . " the production of nuclear fuel is still in suspension and we hope to reach a conclusion over it in the near future , and also reach a clear agreement with the europeans in this regard , " saidi said . eu officials said the resumption violates an agreement to refrain from nuclear activities . " this is very much a step in the wrong direction , " said cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , according to reuters news service .
" we are extremely concerned and consultations are taking place -lrb- within the eu -rrb- to coordinate a response . " asked whether the move increased the likelihood of a referral to the un security council for possible sanctions , gallach said that further steps would have to be discussed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- right -rrb- with former iranian president mohammad khatami at a 2002 meeting solana and ministers from britain , france and germany - the so-called " eu3 " states leading negotiations with iran aimed at persuading it to shelve its nuclear program - are due to meet in berlin on thursday to consider their next step . in vienna , the iaea confirmed that iran removed seals at its natanz atomic research facility under the supervision of its inspectors . us mulls security council referral tehran announced last week it would restart research into the nuclear fuel cycle despite international calls to keep the voluntary suspension of such work in place . the united states , which accuses tehran of seeking to build nuclear weapons , reiterated monday that iran may be referred to the un security council over its action .
but russia said dialogue was still the only way forward . on tuesday , moscow said its offer to enrich uranium jointly with iran at a site on russian territory remained valid .
talks on the compromise proposal are due to resume next month after breaking off at the weekend without agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia had originally offered to help iran with nuclear technology inside the country " we confirmed our proposal , it remains on the negotiating table , and if our iranian colleagues are interested we are ready to develop a joint plan to resolve the entire iranian energy issue , " deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak told interfax news agency . elbaradei is losing patience iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said monday he was " losing patience " with what he called iran 's lack of transparency . the international community has already warned that " the next step would be a referral to the security council " if tehran failed to keep its international obligations , the white house said monday . spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters that iran must maintain a total suspension of activities linked to uranium enrichment , which produces fuel for nuclear power reactors but can also be used to make atomic bombs . " the international community has growing concerns about the regime 's pursuit of nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear programme , " mcclellan said . iran remains defiant iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , voiced defiance on monday , saying tehran would not give up its nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei " the islamic republic of iran will not give up its undeniable rights to peaceful nuclear technology , which has been achieved by the talented youth of the country , " khamenei said . iran has been trying to draw a distinction between research into the fuel cycle and actual production of enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civil reactors or , in highly enriched form , as the explosive core of an atom bomb . the removal of the seals came after talks between russia and iran on a proposed compromise to end the row over uranium enrichment broke off without result sunday , although they are to resume on feb .

it stands to fill the gap between two conflicting trends : shrinking levels of social spending by the government and an increasing desire by shareholder to see that companies are doing something besides just looking to maximize profits . andreas gross , spokesman for the bda employers ' association , said : " csr ... has taken on a new dimension in the past two , maybe three years . ” his organization runs a web site , csrgermany.de , which lists german firms that have csr programs and the various forms they take . “ what has changed is that the public is much more aware of these issues , ” gross said , noting that germany ’ s manager magazin ran a ranking of companies ' csr activities for the first time last year . “ it is certainly relevant for companies that are listed on the stock exchange - they are more carefully watched , ” he added . bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest magazine has been helping german consumers for more than 40 years more and more , companies are realizing that investors as well as consumers are keeping a watchful eye .

and woe to the company that gets on the wrong side of an environmental boycott , like the one that greenpeace started against shell after the oil company announced plans to sink a platform off the north sea a decade ago . ecopencils ? one example of a firm that has successfully tied its social activities to its market segment is europe ’ s biggest pencil maker , faber-castell .
more than a decade ago , the southern german firm developed a pioneering reforestation project in brazil .
the project - far from the rain forest - grows trees for its pencils while creating a sanctuary for protected species .
the company also developed environmentally friendly , water-soluble lacquers for its pencil coatings , winning kudos from the eu environment ministry .
and in 2000 , faber castell instituted a social charter that forbids child labor and supports equal opportunity and equal pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with these , consumers can jot notes with a good conscience such projects are often as much about good publicity as they are about deeply held belief , and the line between the two can be blurry . but in a 2005 study by the international consulting firm pleon , only 10 percent of companies admitted their csr activities were solely meant as pr . still , there are great gulfs in terms of credibility , said wolfgang stark , professor at the university of essen , in a recent deutschlandfunk radio interview . he called britain 's body shop a " beacon of virtue . "
the cosmetics firm is renowned for being built around socially responsible action .
but he also talked about companies that “ basically support csr projects in germany with their left hand , and support a system of exploitation in nigeria with the right . " " i think we will have to live a bit longer with this ambivalence , ” he added . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

" the international community has growing concerns about the regime 's pursuit of nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear programme , " mcclellan said . iran remains defiant iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , voiced defiance on monday , saying tehran would not give up its nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei " the islamic republic of iran will not give up its undeniable rights to peaceful nuclear technology , which has been achieved by the talented youth of the country , " khamenei said . iran has been trying to draw a distinction between research into the fuel cycle and actual production of enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civil reactors or , in highly enriched form , as the explosive core of an atom bomb . the removal of the seals came after talks between russia and iran on a proposed compromise to end the row over uranium enrichment broke off without result sunday , although they are to resume on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.01.2006 business poised to fill growing social gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galatea fountains in stuttgart glisten thanks to a local company german firms have a long history of social involvement .
but increasingly companies are aiming to improve the bottom line along with society by using a publicity-friendly vehicle known as corporate social responsibility . if stuttgart ’ s public fountains are clean and in good repair , local metal-casting concern bornemann + haller may be the one to thank . the company is not in the fountain business , but in 2002 it " adopted " stuttgart ’ s fountains , taking responsibility for their repair and upkeep , together with the local government , as part of its “ goal-oriented company policy ” of social engagement . the move continues a long tradition of german firms taking an active role in communities , be they local or international .
in this case , a company official said the project was chosen even though " fountains are n't our business , " because the need was there and a top executive took an interest . finding a good fit while achim halfmann appreciates the corporate support for local projects , he 'd rather the random nature of it be replaced by with joint actions between business and communities that would help support various causes as well as the companies that fund them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against government cost-cutting reforms " businesses must learn to make the most of their social involvement , and see that it matches their product , their workers , their community - that it reflects what their company is about , " said halfmann , whose consulting company , public integration , ltd . , helps firms develop strategies for aiding their communities . german firms are certainly not laggards when it comes to corporate social responsibility , or csr . a recent eu study showed 54 percent of german companies took an active social role in the life of their communities , compared with an eu average of 49 percent . filling the gap but germany is still well behind european leader finland , where 83 percent of small and midsize companies are social do-gooders . " the anglo-saxon business world is far ahead of europe " when it comes to taking advantage of the opportunities csr presents , halfmann said .
" they 've been doing this for a long time . " yet csr seems poised to become even more important to the welfare of german business .
it stands to fill the gap between two conflicting trends : shrinking levels of social spending by the government and an increasing desire by shareholder to see that companies are doing something besides just looking to maximize profits . andreas gross , spokesman for the bda employers ' association , said : " csr ... has taken on a new dimension in the past two , maybe three years . ” his organization runs a web site , csrgermany.de , which lists german firms that have csr programs and the various forms they take . “ what has changed is that the public is much more aware of these issues , ” gross said , noting that germany ’ s manager magazin ran a ranking of companies ' csr activities for the first time last year . “ it is certainly relevant for companies that are listed on the stock exchange - they are more carefully watched , ” he added . bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest magazine has been helping german consumers for more than 40 years more and more , companies are realizing that investors as well as consumers are keeping a watchful eye .
germany ’ s respected consumer magazine stiftung warentest has started adding social criteria to its product ratings .
and woe to the company that gets on the wrong side of an environmental boycott , like the one that greenpeace started against shell after the oil company announced plans to sink a platform off the north sea a decade ago . ecopencils ? one example of a firm that has successfully tied its social activities to its market segment is europe ’ s biggest pencil maker , faber-castell .
more than a decade ago , the southern german firm developed a pioneering reforestation project in brazil .
the project - far from the rain forest - grows trees for its pencils while creating a sanctuary for protected species .
the company also developed environmentally friendly , water-soluble lacquers for its pencil coatings , winning kudos from the eu environment ministry .
and in 2000 , faber castell instituted a social charter that forbids child labor and supports equal opportunity and equal pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with these , consumers can jot notes with a good conscience such projects are often as much about good publicity as they are about deeply held belief , and the line between the two can be blurry . but in a 2005 study by the international consulting firm pleon , only 10 percent of companies admitted their csr activities were solely meant as pr . still , there are great gulfs in terms of credibility , said wolfgang stark , professor at the university of essen , in a recent deutschlandfunk radio interview . he called britain 's body shop a " beacon of virtue . "
the cosmetics firm is renowned for being built around socially responsible action .
but he also talked about companies that “ basically support csr projects in germany with their left hand , and support a system of exploitation in nigeria with the right . " " i think we will have to live a bit longer with this ambivalence , ” he added . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

dw-radio spoke with him about the dangers of bird flu for europeans . walter haas is head of the unit for respiratory diseases and immunization at the department for infectious disease epidemiology at the robert koch institute in germany .
he is the scientific coordinator of the german working group on influenza and of the expert committee on influenza pandemic preparedness planning in germany . dw-world : bird flu has entered europe - and the threat is coming closer to germany .
how well is are people prepared for it ? walter haas : first , let me state clearly that this is still an animal disease even though there are now 14 suspected cases .
still the majority of cases are still in animals , and the vast majority result from direct contact with sick animals . is there any danger that the more people that become infected with this disease , the more easily it could mutate and spread to more people ? well , of course , there is concern that this virus might change its way of distribution and spread at one point from human to human .
so far , we have no indication that this has happened .
however , one has to be very observant to be sure that there is no change .
the vast distribution -lrb- of the disease -rrb- in more than 10 countries among animals , of course , gives the virus the chance to change and to try and adapt to other hosts including humans .
there has been criticism that the number of cases has been underestimated .
is this true ? i think the cooperation as far as our information goes between the ministry of health in turkey , the world health organization and the eu has been very good .
of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .
and , of course , a lot of people that are concerned are going to be examined and that will lead to identification of cases that might have gone undetected otherwise . we know from other bacteria that even if they are frozen or cooked , they can survive these kind of extreme conditions .
is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

10 , 2006 -rrb- bird flu infections suspected in istanbul the bird flu virus appears to be moving westward as more humans have been infected in turkey .
while several tested positive for the deadly strain in the capital ankara , people in istanbul have been hospitalized .

she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern . us president george w. bush was wrong if he thought that angela merkel would be easier to deal with than gerhard schröder .
that 's become obvious since merkel demanded that the us-run guantanamo prison camp on the island of cuba be shut down .
but it 's also clear now that she will be a reliable partner .
merkel thinks strategically , not tactically , and uses her statements to that effect . this chancellor does n't change foreign policy guidelines during town square rallies ; she does n't criticize allies during election campaign events .
instead , she first voices her concerns where it 's appropriate : in face-to-face meetings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also had clear words about alleged cia abductions during her meeting with rice in december during the berlin visit of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in december , merkel did n't leave any doubt about the fact that she considers the rule of law a priority even in the fight against terror .
that 's why the surprised reaction of the german public to her guantanamo remarks is the only astonishing thing about her statement .
bush certainly had been prepared for her words for at least four weeks . no surprises merkel 's public words are also nothing more than the reflection of a given consensus in europe .
but it 's also true that she is the first european head of government to issue clear demands on specific issues , be it the treatment of prisoners in guantanamo , the abduction of suspects or the establishing of secret cia prisons . specific criticism rather than blanket condemnation is something even george bush can deal with - especially since merkel always combines her remarks with a commitment to german-american friendship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel visited the us just prior to the war in iraq in 2003 the previous government used criticism of us actions ahead of the war in iraq to justify a general withdrawal of affection .
merkel takes a pragmatic approach instead .
specific criticism on the one hand and profound political support on the other are not mutually exclusive in her opinion .
quite to the contrary : only cooperating partners are able to resolve conflicts .
merkel is not suspected of anti-americanism and she uses the freedom to maneuver that comes with that . a critical partner her critical remarks ahead of her us visit have enabled her to widen the field even further .
she comes to washington with strong backing from the public and without any risk of capsizing .
nobody - especially merkel - expects the us government to fulfil even a single one of her demands .
she 's already getting applause just for raising the issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is gliding on a wave of public support at home bush on the other hand is facing a chancellor who will offer herself as a partner despite all the criticism .
she 's doing this from a strengthened position - strongly rooted in europe , with broad backing by her government and public support behind her . this angela merkel has much a better chance of being taken seriously in washington than her predecessor .
that 's crucial as germany has long disappeared from the top of the list of us priorities and was in danger of falling further under schröder . whether it is the united fight against terror , the cooperation with the -lrb- at best -rrb- semi-democratic russia or the nuclear row with iran - germany and europe can deal with these issues much more successfully at the us 's side rather than without or even in opposition to america . but washington expects at least political or economical - if not military - support in iraq from its partners .

she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern . us president george w. bush was wrong if he thought that angela merkel would be easier to deal with than gerhard schröder .
that 's become obvious since merkel demanded that the us-run guantanamo prison camp on the island of cuba be shut down .
but it 's also clear now that she will be a reliable partner .
merkel thinks strategically , not tactically , and uses her statements to that effect . this chancellor does n't change foreign policy guidelines during town square rallies ; she does n't criticize allies during election campaign events .
instead , she first voices her concerns where it 's appropriate : in face-to-face meetings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also had clear words about alleged cia abductions during her meeting with rice in december during the berlin visit of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in december , merkel did n't leave any doubt about the fact that she considers the rule of law a priority even in the fight against terror .
that 's why the surprised reaction of the german public to her guantanamo remarks is the only astonishing thing about her statement .
bush certainly had been prepared for her words for at least four weeks . no surprises merkel 's public words are also nothing more than the reflection of a given consensus in europe .
but it 's also true that she is the first european head of government to issue clear demands on specific issues , be it the treatment of prisoners in guantanamo , the abduction of suspects or the establishing of secret cia prisons . specific criticism rather than blanket condemnation is something even george bush can deal with - especially since merkel always combines her remarks with a commitment to german-american friendship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel visited the us just prior to the war in iraq in 2003 the previous government used criticism of us actions ahead of the war in iraq to justify a general withdrawal of affection .
merkel takes a pragmatic approach instead .
specific criticism on the one hand and profound political support on the other are not mutually exclusive in her opinion .
quite to the contrary : only cooperating partners are able to resolve conflicts .
merkel is not suspected of anti-americanism and she uses the freedom to maneuver that comes with that . a critical partner her critical remarks ahead of her us visit have enabled her to widen the field even further .
she comes to washington with strong backing from the public and without any risk of capsizing .
nobody - especially merkel - expects the us government to fulfil even a single one of her demands .
she 's already getting applause just for raising the issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is gliding on a wave of public support at home bush on the other hand is facing a chancellor who will offer herself as a partner despite all the criticism .
she 's doing this from a strengthened position - strongly rooted in europe , with broad backing by her government and public support behind her . this angela merkel has much a better chance of being taken seriously in washington than her predecessor .
that 's crucial as germany has long disappeared from the top of the list of us priorities and was in danger of falling further under schröder . whether it is the united fight against terror , the cooperation with the -lrb- at best -rrb- semi-democratic russia or the nuclear row with iran - germany and europe can deal with these issues much more successfully at the us 's side rather than without or even in opposition to america . but washington expects at least political or economical - if not military - support in iraq from its partners .

dw-radio spoke with him about the dangers of bird flu for europeans . walter haas is head of the unit for respiratory diseases and immunization at the department for infectious disease epidemiology at the robert koch institute in germany .
he is the scientific coordinator of the german working group on influenza and of the expert committee on influenza pandemic preparedness planning in germany . dw-world : bird flu has entered europe - and the threat is coming closer to germany .
how well is are people prepared for it ? walter haas : first , let me state clearly that this is still an animal disease even though there are now 14 suspected cases .
still the majority of cases are still in animals , and the vast majority result from direct contact with sick animals . is there any danger that the more people that become infected with this disease , the more easily it could mutate and spread to more people ? well , of course , there is concern that this virus might change its way of distribution and spread at one point from human to human .
so far , we have no indication that this has happened .
however , one has to be very observant to be sure that there is no change .
the vast distribution -lrb- of the disease -rrb- in more than 10 countries among animals , of course , gives the virus the chance to change and to try and adapt to other hosts including humans .
there has been criticism that the number of cases has been underestimated .
is this true ? i think the cooperation as far as our information goes between the ministry of health in turkey , the world health organization and the eu has been very good .
of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .
and , of course , a lot of people that are concerned are going to be examined and that will lead to identification of cases that might have gone undetected otherwise . we know from other bacteria that even if they are frozen or cooked , they can survive these kind of extreme conditions .
is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

dw-radio spoke with him about the dangers of bird flu for europeans . walter haas is head of the unit for respiratory diseases and immunization at the department for infectious disease epidemiology at the robert koch institute in germany .
he is the scientific coordinator of the german working group on influenza and of the expert committee on influenza pandemic preparedness planning in germany . dw-world : bird flu has entered europe - and the threat is coming closer to germany .
how well is are people prepared for it ? walter haas : first , let me state clearly that this is still an animal disease even though there are now 14 suspected cases .
still the majority of cases are still in animals , and the vast majority result from direct contact with sick animals . is there any danger that the more people that become infected with this disease , the more easily it could mutate and spread to more people ? well , of course , there is concern that this virus might change its way of distribution and spread at one point from human to human .
so far , we have no indication that this has happened .
however , one has to be very observant to be sure that there is no change .
the vast distribution -lrb- of the disease -rrb- in more than 10 countries among animals , of course , gives the virus the chance to change and to try and adapt to other hosts including humans .
there has been criticism that the number of cases has been underestimated .
is this true ? i think the cooperation as far as our information goes between the ministry of health in turkey , the world health organization and the eu has been very good .
of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .
and , of course , a lot of people that are concerned are going to be examined and that will lead to identification of cases that might have gone undetected otherwise . we know from other bacteria that even if they are frozen or cooked , they can survive these kind of extreme conditions .
is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

german soccer officials have rejected the accusations . stiftung warentest , an independent consumer protection watchdog respected throughout germany for its rating of consumer products and services , released a study showing that world cup stadium venues were ill-equipped to cope with disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist falk murke , right , and jürgen ambrecht of consumer magazine " stiftung warentest " according to the authors of the study , which examined the stadiums last september and october , two-thirds of the venues to be used during this summer 's world cup failed to comply with security guidelines established by the international soccer body fifa . lessons never learned although safety in general has improved since the 1980s when multiple fatalities at the heysel , bradford and hillsborough soccer stadiums in england hit the headlines , deficiencies still persist , the study said .
what 's more , it added , many of the lessons stadium builders should have drawn from past disasters seem to have been ignored . a close look at evacuation routes found , for example , that many of the stadiums had no plan to allow fans to enter the pitch in case of a mass panic .

dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .

there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .

dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .

dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2006 german government approves multi-billion investment program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cabinet ministers discuss germany 's future near berlin germany 's government of christian and social democrats has sent out a signal of industriousness by approving a 25-billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2-billion -rrb- growth and investment package to take effect this year . the state-funded shot in the arm for the ailing german economy is meant to boost consumer confidence and create new jobs .
but the program comes at the cost of fresh borrowing and a value-added tax hike in 2007 which may nip in the bud any temporary upswing . at their two-day strategy meeting at a castle near berlin , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet ministers as well as other christian and social democrat leaders approved a 25-billion-euro spending program which they sold as just the right tool to kick-start the sluggish economy . while details on how much would be spent and on what remained undisclosed on monday , the allocated money is certain to go into research and infrastructure projects .
it 'll also be used to ensure favorable tax treatment for capital investment and housing to provide incentives particularly to the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises . private investment incentive " we 're first and foremost talking about incentives for more growth and employment , " said labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering .
" the 25 billion euros from the state will only be half of the equation with the ensuing increase in private investment being equally important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen christian democrat family minister ursula von der leyen said she is glad that part of the money will also go into more support for young families . " it 's our aim to give families with small children a better deal , " she said .
" the parents concerned are usually only at the beginning of their careers and tend to have relatively small incomes .
at the same time , they face higher costs in bringing up their kids .
so it 's only fair to offer them some sort of financial compensation . " opposition calls program " ridiculous " opposition liberal democrat leader guido westerwelle however countered that the harmony radiating from the government 's meeting is ridiculous if one looks at the expected impact of the spending program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle wanted to join merkel in a center-right coalition government " this growth and investment program is a flash in the pan , " he said .
" it 's based on fresh borrowing and wo n't have a long-term impact , because it does n't really address any of this country 's structural deficits . " opposition greens leader claudia roth does n't think much of the program , either . " it does n't strike me as very logical that the government should now lay on a massive investment program , while it 'll raise value-added tax next year with a view to getting the money back from people immediately , " she said . no other breakthroughs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late night talks did n't lead to any other decisions the government 's strategy meeting , which ends on tuesday , is not expected to result in breakthroughs in a number of other policy fields . christian and social democrat ministers said on monday that a long-term plan for the country 's energy policy and the future use of nuclear power in particular would only be adopted at a summit meeting in the spring . there wo n't be any tangible progress either towards a compromise on long overdue health service reforms . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government retreats to re-think germany 's future the german government is holding a two-day strategy meeting meant to bring both sides of the " grand coalition " into harmony .
among other things , ministers will deal with a planned multi-billion investment program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2006 german government approves multi-billion investment program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cabinet ministers discuss germany 's future near berlin germany 's government of christian and social democrats has sent out a signal of industriousness by approving a 25-billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2-billion -rrb- growth and investment package to take effect this year . the state-funded shot in the arm for the ailing german economy is meant to boost consumer confidence and create new jobs .
but the program comes at the cost of fresh borrowing and a value-added tax hike in 2007 which may nip in the bud any temporary upswing . at their two-day strategy meeting at a castle near berlin , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet ministers as well as other christian and social democrat leaders approved a 25-billion-euro spending program which they sold as just the right tool to kick-start the sluggish economy . while details on how much would be spent and on what remained undisclosed on monday , the allocated money is certain to go into research and infrastructure projects .
it 'll also be used to ensure favorable tax treatment for capital investment and housing to provide incentives particularly to the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises . private investment incentive " we 're first and foremost talking about incentives for more growth and employment , " said labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering .
" the 25 billion euros from the state will only be half of the equation with the ensuing increase in private investment being equally important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen christian democrat family minister ursula von der leyen said she is glad that part of the money will also go into more support for young families . " it 's our aim to give families with small children a better deal , " she said .
" the parents concerned are usually only at the beginning of their careers and tend to have relatively small incomes .
at the same time , they face higher costs in bringing up their kids .
so it 's only fair to offer them some sort of financial compensation . " opposition calls program " ridiculous " opposition liberal democrat leader guido westerwelle however countered that the harmony radiating from the government 's meeting is ridiculous if one looks at the expected impact of the spending program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle wanted to join merkel in a center-right coalition government " this growth and investment program is a flash in the pan , " he said .
" it 's based on fresh borrowing and wo n't have a long-term impact , because it does n't really address any of this country 's structural deficits . " opposition greens leader claudia roth does n't think much of the program , either . " it does n't strike me as very logical that the government should now lay on a massive investment program , while it 'll raise value-added tax next year with a view to getting the money back from people immediately , " she said . no other breakthroughs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late night talks did n't lead to any other decisions the government 's strategy meeting , which ends on tuesday , is not expected to result in breakthroughs in a number of other policy fields . christian and social democrat ministers said on monday that a long-term plan for the country 's energy policy and the future use of nuclear power in particular would only be adopted at a summit meeting in the spring . there wo n't be any tangible progress either towards a compromise on long overdue health service reforms . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government retreats to re-think germany 's future the german government is holding a two-day strategy meeting meant to bring both sides of the " grand coalition " into harmony .
among other things , ministers will deal with a planned multi-billion investment program .

an official decision of the latter is expected by the end of next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are pope " was the headline in bild when german-born benedict xvi was elected springer 's media empire is currently largely focussed on the print sector , the mass-circulation bild tabloid with roughly 12 million readers being its crown jewel .
last august , springer announced that it had agreed to buy prosiebensat.1 - germany 's largest private television group - from a group of us investors . kek officials said the merger would bring together too many different media under one roof , resulting in a " dominant power of opinion " for the newly formed company . the cartel office has voiced concerns about the effects the takeover would have on the advertising market for both the television and print market .
it has given springer until thursday to come up with a new proposal . springer defends deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosiebensat.1 satellite dishes in berlin if springer holds on to bild , it is - under federal anti-monopoly rules - not allowed to own one of the main prosiebensat.1 television channels - either sat.1 or prosieben - which would devalue the worth of any deal . springer ceo matthias döpfner on tuesday meanwhile defended the proposed takeover , saying that the control bodies were overlooking global and digital shifts in the media world . he added that the company would look for other ventures outside germany if the deal is rejected . " we will take that and try our luck in the digital markets and abroad , " he said , according to the ap news service . bringing in a partner ? according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , springer is also contemplating bringing in sbs broadcasting , which owns private commercial television and radio stations in western and central europe .
sbs could then buy prosieben or sat.1 to win approval from the deal .
springer officials declined to comment on the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer headquarters in berlin the kek 's decision is not final , however , as springer officials can still call on germany 's state media boards , who could overturn the rejection of the deal . but jörg tauss , the media policy expert for germany 's social democrats in parliament , called on the directors of state media boards not to take such a step .
he welcomed the kek decision , saying that it guaranteed media diversity in germany . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-cartel office rejects springer 's prosieben takeover germany 's anti-cartel office has rejected an offer by newspaper publisher axel springer to buy commercial television group prosiebensat1 despite proposed concessions .

eu officials condemned the move and said counter-steps would have to be discussed . " today , with the authorization given by the iaea to its inspectors -lrb- to supervise the action -rrb- ... seals from a number of research centers were removed , " said mohammad saidi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency said , referring to the international atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran 's nuclear research reactor at the iran 's atomic energy organization 's headquarters " as of today these centers resume their activities , " saidi told reporters .
" the research will be carried out in all the centers that we told the iaea about , and we will restart our work . " the production of nuclear fuel is still in suspension and we hope to reach a conclusion over it in the near future , and also reach a clear agreement with the europeans in this regard , " saidi said . eu officials said the resumption violates an agreement to refrain from nuclear activities . " this is very much a step in the wrong direction , " said cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , according to reuters news service .
" we are extremely concerned and consultations are taking place -lrb- within the eu -rrb- to coordinate a response . " asked whether the move increased the likelihood of a referral to the un security council for possible sanctions , gallach said that further steps would have to be discussed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- right -rrb- with former iranian president mohammad khatami at a 2002 meeting solana and ministers from britain , france and germany - the so-called " eu3 " states leading negotiations with iran aimed at persuading it to shelve its nuclear program - are due to meet in berlin on thursday to consider their next step . in vienna , the iaea confirmed that iran removed seals at its natanz atomic research facility under the supervision of its inspectors . us mulls security council referral tehran announced last week it would restart research into the nuclear fuel cycle despite international calls to keep the voluntary suspension of such work in place . the united states , which accuses tehran of seeking to build nuclear weapons , reiterated monday that iran may be referred to the un security council over its action .
but russia said dialogue was still the only way forward . on tuesday , moscow said its offer to enrich uranium jointly with iran at a site on russian territory remained valid .
talks on the compromise proposal are due to resume next month after breaking off at the weekend without agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia had originally offered to help iran with nuclear technology inside the country " we confirmed our proposal , it remains on the negotiating table , and if our iranian colleagues are interested we are ready to develop a joint plan to resolve the entire iranian energy issue , " deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak told interfax news agency . elbaradei is losing patience iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said monday he was " losing patience " with what he called iran 's lack of transparency . the international community has already warned that " the next step would be a referral to the security council " if tehran failed to keep its international obligations , the white house said monday . spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters that iran must maintain a total suspension of activities linked to uranium enrichment , which produces fuel for nuclear power reactors but can also be used to make atomic bombs . " the international community has growing concerns about the regime 's pursuit of nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear programme , " mcclellan said . iran remains defiant iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , voiced defiance on monday , saying tehran would not give up its nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei " the islamic republic of iran will not give up its undeniable rights to peaceful nuclear technology , which has been achieved by the talented youth of the country , " khamenei said . iran has been trying to draw a distinction between research into the fuel cycle and actual production of enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civil reactors or , in highly enriched form , as the explosive core of an atom bomb . the removal of the seals came after talks between russia and iran on a proposed compromise to end the row over uranium enrichment broke off without result sunday , although they are to resume on feb .

german soccer officials have rejected the accusations . stiftung warentest , an independent consumer protection watchdog respected throughout germany for its rating of consumer products and services , released a study showing that world cup stadium venues were ill-equipped to cope with disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist falk murke , right , and jürgen ambrecht of consumer magazine " stiftung warentest " according to the authors of the study , which examined the stadiums last september and october , two-thirds of the venues to be used during this summer 's world cup failed to comply with security guidelines established by the international soccer body fifa . lessons never learned although safety in general has improved since the 1980s when multiple fatalities at the heysel , bradford and hillsborough soccer stadiums in england hit the headlines , deficiencies still persist , the study said .
what 's more , it added , many of the lessons stadium builders should have drawn from past disasters seem to have been ignored . a close look at evacuation routes found , for example , that many of the stadiums had no plan to allow fans to enter the pitch in case of a mass panic .
three of the four world cup stadiums marked as having " serious deficiencies " – gelsenkirchen , leipzig and berlin – were not prepared for a mass evacuation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new multi-million euro stadium in leipzig does n't meet security requirements , the report says crowd panic , set off by a bomb warning or a rowdy brawl , could have fatal consequences , stiftung warentest concluded .
the fourth , fritz walter in the city of kaserslautern , was reported to have serious faults in terms of fire protection . " the results were sobering .
many of the conclusions drawn 20 years ago have either been forgotten or partly ignored , " holger brackmann , department chief at the consumer watchdog , said at a news conference . besides the four described with " serious deficiencies , " the consumer group sighted shortcomings in four other stadiums , including munich 's dazzling new arena that will host the opening match on june 9 .
an additional four venues were rated as having " clear failings . " unwanted criticism ? the stiftung warentest study , some aspects of which were leaked in advance , has sparked an angry reaction from the president of the world cup 's organizing committee , franz beckenbauer -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer " stiftung warentest may know about face lotions , olive oils and vacuums .
that 's what they should stick with , " he told the mass-circulation daily bild . " i 'm really sick and tired of the army of know-it-alls trying to lift their profile at the expense of the world cup , " beckenbauer said . according to peter peters , manager of gelsenkirchen-based schalke 04 , the magazine was only interested in a circulation boost with its explosive report . " stiftung warentest is making itself look ridiculous with their results , " he said . for its part , the consumer protection group defended its article , saying it had given organizers five months to improve matters .
it is also not the first time the group has tested stadium safety . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " considerable " defects found in world cup stadiums five months before the opening game , a respected german consumer magazine said its test of germany 's 12 world cup venues uncovered safety problems that could have a " devastating effect " in the event of mass panic .

dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .

this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .

dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .

these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .
she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern .

eu officials condemned the move and said counter-steps would have to be discussed . " today , with the authorization given by the iaea to its inspectors -lrb- to supervise the action -rrb- ... seals from a number of research centers were removed , " said mohammad saidi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy agency said , referring to the international atomic energy agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tehran 's nuclear research reactor at the iran 's atomic energy organization 's headquarters " as of today these centers resume their activities , " saidi told reporters .
" the research will be carried out in all the centers that we told the iaea about , and we will restart our work . " the production of nuclear fuel is still in suspension and we hope to reach a conclusion over it in the near future , and also reach a clear agreement with the europeans in this regard , " saidi said . eu officials said the resumption violates an agreement to refrain from nuclear activities . " this is very much a step in the wrong direction , " said cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , according to reuters news service .
" we are extremely concerned and consultations are taking place -lrb- within the eu -rrb- to coordinate a response . " asked whether the move increased the likelihood of a referral to the un security council for possible sanctions , gallach said that further steps would have to be discussed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- right -rrb- with former iranian president mohammad khatami at a 2002 meeting solana and ministers from britain , france and germany - the so-called " eu3 " states leading negotiations with iran aimed at persuading it to shelve its nuclear program - are due to meet in berlin on thursday to consider their next step . in vienna , the iaea confirmed that iran removed seals at its natanz atomic research facility under the supervision of its inspectors . us mulls security council referral tehran announced last week it would restart research into the nuclear fuel cycle despite international calls to keep the voluntary suspension of such work in place . the united states , which accuses tehran of seeking to build nuclear weapons , reiterated monday that iran may be referred to the un security council over its action .
but russia said dialogue was still the only way forward . on tuesday , moscow said its offer to enrich uranium jointly with iran at a site on russian territory remained valid .
talks on the compromise proposal are due to resume next month after breaking off at the weekend without agreement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia had originally offered to help iran with nuclear technology inside the country " we confirmed our proposal , it remains on the negotiating table , and if our iranian colleagues are interested we are ready to develop a joint plan to resolve the entire iranian energy issue , " deputy foreign minister sergei kislyak told interfax news agency . elbaradei is losing patience iaea chief mohamed elbaradei said monday he was " losing patience " with what he called iran 's lack of transparency . the international community has already warned that " the next step would be a referral to the security council " if tehran failed to keep its international obligations , the white house said monday . spokesman scott mcclellan told reporters that iran must maintain a total suspension of activities linked to uranium enrichment , which produces fuel for nuclear power reactors but can also be used to make atomic bombs . " the international community has growing concerns about the regime 's pursuit of nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear programme , " mcclellan said . iran remains defiant iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , voiced defiance on monday , saying tehran would not give up its nuclear program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei " the islamic republic of iran will not give up its undeniable rights to peaceful nuclear technology , which has been achieved by the talented youth of the country , " khamenei said . iran has been trying to draw a distinction between research into the fuel cycle and actual production of enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civil reactors or , in highly enriched form , as the explosive core of an atom bomb . the removal of the seals came after talks between russia and iran on a proposed compromise to end the row over uranium enrichment broke off without result sunday , although they are to resume on feb .

dw-radio spoke with him about the dangers of bird flu for europeans . walter haas is head of the unit for respiratory diseases and immunization at the department for infectious disease epidemiology at the robert koch institute in germany .
he is the scientific coordinator of the german working group on influenza and of the expert committee on influenza pandemic preparedness planning in germany . dw-world : bird flu has entered europe - and the threat is coming closer to germany .
how well is are people prepared for it ? walter haas : first , let me state clearly that this is still an animal disease even though there are now 14 suspected cases .
still the majority of cases are still in animals , and the vast majority result from direct contact with sick animals . is there any danger that the more people that become infected with this disease , the more easily it could mutate and spread to more people ? well , of course , there is concern that this virus might change its way of distribution and spread at one point from human to human .
so far , we have no indication that this has happened .
however , one has to be very observant to be sure that there is no change .
the vast distribution -lrb- of the disease -rrb- in more than 10 countries among animals , of course , gives the virus the chance to change and to try and adapt to other hosts including humans .
there has been criticism that the number of cases has been underestimated .
is this true ? i think the cooperation as far as our information goes between the ministry of health in turkey , the world health organization and the eu has been very good .
of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .
and , of course , a lot of people that are concerned are going to be examined and that will lead to identification of cases that might have gone undetected otherwise . we know from other bacteria that even if they are frozen or cooked , they can survive these kind of extreme conditions .
is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern . us president george w. bush was wrong if he thought that angela merkel would be easier to deal with than gerhard schröder .
that 's become obvious since merkel demanded that the us-run guantanamo prison camp on the island of cuba be shut down .

she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern . us president george w. bush was wrong if he thought that angela merkel would be easier to deal with than gerhard schröder .
that 's become obvious since merkel demanded that the us-run guantanamo prison camp on the island of cuba be shut down .
but it 's also clear now that she will be a reliable partner .
merkel thinks strategically , not tactically , and uses her statements to that effect . this chancellor does n't change foreign policy guidelines during town square rallies ; she does n't criticize allies during election campaign events .
instead , she first voices her concerns where it 's appropriate : in face-to-face meetings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also had clear words about alleged cia abductions during her meeting with rice in december during the berlin visit of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in december , merkel did n't leave any doubt about the fact that she considers the rule of law a priority even in the fight against terror .
that 's why the surprised reaction of the german public to her guantanamo remarks is the only astonishing thing about her statement .
bush certainly had been prepared for her words for at least four weeks . no surprises merkel 's public words are also nothing more than the reflection of a given consensus in europe .
but it 's also true that she is the first european head of government to issue clear demands on specific issues , be it the treatment of prisoners in guantanamo , the abduction of suspects or the establishing of secret cia prisons . specific criticism rather than blanket condemnation is something even george bush can deal with - especially since merkel always combines her remarks with a commitment to german-american friendship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel visited the us just prior to the war in iraq in 2003 the previous government used criticism of us actions ahead of the war in iraq to justify a general withdrawal of affection .
merkel takes a pragmatic approach instead .
specific criticism on the one hand and profound political support on the other are not mutually exclusive in her opinion .
quite to the contrary : only cooperating partners are able to resolve conflicts .
merkel is not suspected of anti-americanism and she uses the freedom to maneuver that comes with that . a critical partner her critical remarks ahead of her us visit have enabled her to widen the field even further .
she comes to washington with strong backing from the public and without any risk of capsizing .
nobody - especially merkel - expects the us government to fulfil even a single one of her demands .
she 's already getting applause just for raising the issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is gliding on a wave of public support at home bush on the other hand is facing a chancellor who will offer herself as a partner despite all the criticism .
she 's doing this from a strengthened position - strongly rooted in europe , with broad backing by her government and public support behind her . this angela merkel has much a better chance of being taken seriously in washington than her predecessor .
that 's crucial as germany has long disappeared from the top of the list of us priorities and was in danger of falling further under schröder . whether it is the united fight against terror , the cooperation with the -lrb- at best -rrb- semi-democratic russia or the nuclear row with iran - germany and europe can deal with these issues much more successfully at the us 's side rather than without or even in opposition to america . but washington expects at least political or economical - if not military - support in iraq from its partners .

german soccer officials have rejected the accusations . stiftung warentest , an independent consumer protection watchdog respected throughout germany for its rating of consumer products and services , released a study showing that world cup stadium venues were ill-equipped to cope with disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist falk murke , right , and jürgen ambrecht of consumer magazine " stiftung warentest " according to the authors of the study , which examined the stadiums last september and october , two-thirds of the venues to be used during this summer 's world cup failed to comply with security guidelines established by the international soccer body fifa . lessons never learned although safety in general has improved since the 1980s when multiple fatalities at the heysel , bradford and hillsborough soccer stadiums in england hit the headlines , deficiencies still persist , the study said .
what 's more , it added , many of the lessons stadium builders should have drawn from past disasters seem to have been ignored . a close look at evacuation routes found , for example , that many of the stadiums had no plan to allow fans to enter the pitch in case of a mass panic .
three of the four world cup stadiums marked as having " serious deficiencies " – gelsenkirchen , leipzig and berlin – were not prepared for a mass evacuation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new multi-million euro stadium in leipzig does n't meet security requirements , the report says crowd panic , set off by a bomb warning or a rowdy brawl , could have fatal consequences , stiftung warentest concluded .
the fourth , fritz walter in the city of kaserslautern , was reported to have serious faults in terms of fire protection . " the results were sobering .
many of the conclusions drawn 20 years ago have either been forgotten or partly ignored , " holger brackmann , department chief at the consumer watchdog , said at a news conference . besides the four described with " serious deficiencies , " the consumer group sighted shortcomings in four other stadiums , including munich 's dazzling new arena that will host the opening match on june 9 .
an additional four venues were rated as having " clear failings . " unwanted criticism ? the stiftung warentest study , some aspects of which were leaked in advance , has sparked an angry reaction from the president of the world cup 's organizing committee , franz beckenbauer -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer " stiftung warentest may know about face lotions , olive oils and vacuums .
that 's what they should stick with , " he told the mass-circulation daily bild . " i 'm really sick and tired of the army of know-it-alls trying to lift their profile at the expense of the world cup , " beckenbauer said . according to peter peters , manager of gelsenkirchen-based schalke 04 , the magazine was only interested in a circulation boost with its explosive report . " stiftung warentest is making itself look ridiculous with their results , " he said . for its part , the consumer protection group defended its article , saying it had given organizers five months to improve matters .
it is also not the first time the group has tested stadium safety . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " considerable " defects found in world cup stadiums five months before the opening game , a respected german consumer magazine said its test of germany 's 12 world cup venues uncovered safety problems that could have a " devastating effect " in the event of mass panic .

dw-radio spoke with him about the dangers of bird flu for europeans . walter haas is head of the unit for respiratory diseases and immunization at the department for infectious disease epidemiology at the robert koch institute in germany .
he is the scientific coordinator of the german working group on influenza and of the expert committee on influenza pandemic preparedness planning in germany . dw-world : bird flu has entered europe - and the threat is coming closer to germany .
how well is are people prepared for it ? walter haas : first , let me state clearly that this is still an animal disease even though there are now 14 suspected cases .
still the majority of cases are still in animals , and the vast majority result from direct contact with sick animals . is there any danger that the more people that become infected with this disease , the more easily it could mutate and spread to more people ? well , of course , there is concern that this virus might change its way of distribution and spread at one point from human to human .
so far , we have no indication that this has happened .
however , one has to be very observant to be sure that there is no change .
the vast distribution -lrb- of the disease -rrb- in more than 10 countries among animals , of course , gives the virus the chance to change and to try and adapt to other hosts including humans .
there has been criticism that the number of cases has been underestimated .
is this true ? i think the cooperation as far as our information goes between the ministry of health in turkey , the world health organization and the eu has been very good .
of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .
and , of course , a lot of people that are concerned are going to be examined and that will lead to identification of cases that might have gone undetected otherwise . we know from other bacteria that even if they are frozen or cooked , they can survive these kind of extreme conditions .
is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

dw-radio spoke with him about the dangers of bird flu for europeans . walter haas is head of the unit for respiratory diseases and immunization at the department for infectious disease epidemiology at the robert koch institute in germany .
he is the scientific coordinator of the german working group on influenza and of the expert committee on influenza pandemic preparedness planning in germany . dw-world : bird flu has entered europe - and the threat is coming closer to germany .
how well is are people prepared for it ? walter haas : first , let me state clearly that this is still an animal disease even though there are now 14 suspected cases .
still the majority of cases are still in animals , and the vast majority result from direct contact with sick animals . is there any danger that the more people that become infected with this disease , the more easily it could mutate and spread to more people ? well , of course , there is concern that this virus might change its way of distribution and spread at one point from human to human .
so far , we have no indication that this has happened .
however , one has to be very observant to be sure that there is no change .
the vast distribution -lrb- of the disease -rrb- in more than 10 countries among animals , of course , gives the virus the chance to change and to try and adapt to other hosts including humans .
there has been criticism that the number of cases has been underestimated .
is this true ? i think the cooperation as far as our information goes between the ministry of health in turkey , the world health organization and the eu has been very good .
of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .
and , of course , a lot of people that are concerned are going to be examined and that will lead to identification of cases that might have gone undetected otherwise . we know from other bacteria that even if they are frozen or cooked , they can survive these kind of extreme conditions .
is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

10 , 2006 -rrb- bird flu infections suspected in istanbul the bird flu virus appears to be moving westward as more humans have been infected in turkey .
while several tested positive for the deadly strain in the capital ankara , people in istanbul have been hospitalized .
-lrb- jan .
9 , 2006 -rrb- dead birds raise virus scare in germany the discovery of more than 20 dead birds at a pond in western germany has raised fears that avian flu may have already found its way into the country , though officials are urging the public to remain calm .

dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .

while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .

they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .
she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern .

but the program comes at the cost of fresh borrowing and a value-added tax hike in 2007 which may nip in the bud any temporary upswing . at their two-day strategy meeting at a castle near berlin , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet ministers as well as other christian and social democrat leaders approved a 25-billion-euro spending program which they sold as just the right tool to kick-start the sluggish economy . while details on how much would be spent and on what remained undisclosed on monday , the allocated money is certain to go into research and infrastructure projects .

but the program comes at the cost of fresh borrowing and a value-added tax hike in 2007 which may nip in the bud any temporary upswing . at their two-day strategy meeting at a castle near berlin , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet ministers as well as other christian and social democrat leaders approved a 25-billion-euro spending program which they sold as just the right tool to kick-start the sluggish economy . while details on how much would be spent and on what remained undisclosed on monday , the allocated money is certain to go into research and infrastructure projects .
it 'll also be used to ensure favorable tax treatment for capital investment and housing to provide incentives particularly to the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises . private investment incentive " we 're first and foremost talking about incentives for more growth and employment , " said labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering .
" the 25 billion euros from the state will only be half of the equation with the ensuing increase in private investment being equally important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen christian democrat family minister ursula von der leyen said she is glad that part of the money will also go into more support for young families . " it 's our aim to give families with small children a better deal , " she said .
" the parents concerned are usually only at the beginning of their careers and tend to have relatively small incomes .
at the same time , they face higher costs in bringing up their kids .
so it 's only fair to offer them some sort of financial compensation . " opposition calls program " ridiculous " opposition liberal democrat leader guido westerwelle however countered that the harmony radiating from the government 's meeting is ridiculous if one looks at the expected impact of the spending program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle wanted to join merkel in a center-right coalition government " this growth and investment program is a flash in the pan , " he said .
" it 's based on fresh borrowing and wo n't have a long-term impact , because it does n't really address any of this country 's structural deficits . " opposition greens leader claudia roth does n't think much of the program , either . " it does n't strike me as very logical that the government should now lay on a massive investment program , while it 'll raise value-added tax next year with a view to getting the money back from people immediately , " she said . no other breakthroughs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late night talks did n't lead to any other decisions the government 's strategy meeting , which ends on tuesday , is not expected to result in breakthroughs in a number of other policy fields . christian and social democrat ministers said on monday that a long-term plan for the country 's energy policy and the future use of nuclear power in particular would only be adopted at a summit meeting in the spring . there wo n't be any tangible progress either towards a compromise on long overdue health service reforms . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government retreats to re-think germany 's future the german government is holding a two-day strategy meeting meant to bring both sides of the " grand coalition " into harmony .
among other things , ministers will deal with a planned multi-billion investment program .

german soccer officials have rejected the accusations . stiftung warentest , an independent consumer protection watchdog respected throughout germany for its rating of consumer products and services , released a study showing that world cup stadium venues were ill-equipped to cope with disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist falk murke , right , and jürgen ambrecht of consumer magazine " stiftung warentest " according to the authors of the study , which examined the stadiums last september and october , two-thirds of the venues to be used during this summer 's world cup failed to comply with security guidelines established by the international soccer body fifa . lessons never learned although safety in general has improved since the 1980s when multiple fatalities at the heysel , bradford and hillsborough soccer stadiums in england hit the headlines , deficiencies still persist , the study said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany -pipe- 10.01.2006 opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll understand each other german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .
she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern . us president george w. bush was wrong if he thought that angela merkel would be easier to deal with than gerhard schröder .
that 's become obvious since merkel demanded that the us-run guantanamo prison camp on the island of cuba be shut down .
but it 's also clear now that she will be a reliable partner .
merkel thinks strategically , not tactically , and uses her statements to that effect . this chancellor does n't change foreign policy guidelines during town square rallies ; she does n't criticize allies during election campaign events .
instead , she first voices her concerns where it 's appropriate : in face-to-face meetings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also had clear words about alleged cia abductions during her meeting with rice in december during the berlin visit of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in december , merkel did n't leave any doubt about the fact that she considers the rule of law a priority even in the fight against terror .
that 's why the surprised reaction of the german public to her guantanamo remarks is the only astonishing thing about her statement .
bush certainly had been prepared for her words for at least four weeks . no surprises merkel 's public words are also nothing more than the reflection of a given consensus in europe .
but it 's also true that she is the first european head of government to issue clear demands on specific issues , be it the treatment of prisoners in guantanamo , the abduction of suspects or the establishing of secret cia prisons . specific criticism rather than blanket condemnation is something even george bush can deal with - especially since merkel always combines her remarks with a commitment to german-american friendship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel visited the us just prior to the war in iraq in 2003 the previous government used criticism of us actions ahead of the war in iraq to justify a general withdrawal of affection .
merkel takes a pragmatic approach instead .
specific criticism on the one hand and profound political support on the other are not mutually exclusive in her opinion .
quite to the contrary : only cooperating partners are able to resolve conflicts .
merkel is not suspected of anti-americanism and she uses the freedom to maneuver that comes with that . a critical partner her critical remarks ahead of her us visit have enabled her to widen the field even further .
she comes to washington with strong backing from the public and without any risk of capsizing .
nobody - especially merkel - expects the us government to fulfil even a single one of her demands .
she 's already getting applause just for raising the issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is gliding on a wave of public support at home bush on the other hand is facing a chancellor who will offer herself as a partner despite all the criticism .
she 's doing this from a strengthened position - strongly rooted in europe , with broad backing by her government and public support behind her . this angela merkel has much a better chance of being taken seriously in washington than her predecessor .
that 's crucial as germany has long disappeared from the top of the list of us priorities and was in danger of falling further under schröder . whether it is the united fight against terror , the cooperation with the -lrb- at best -rrb- semi-democratic russia or the nuclear row with iran - germany and europe can deal with these issues much more successfully at the us 's side rather than without or even in opposition to america . but washington expects at least political or economical - if not military - support in iraq from its partners .
knowing this , merkel has set the boundaries ahead of her visit in order to prevent the price of improved us-german relations from rising too high . uta thofern -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the united states for some of its tactics in the fight against terrorism and called for the guantanamo bay detention center to be closed in an interview published saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany -pipe- 10.01.2006 opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll understand each other german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .
she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern . us president george w. bush was wrong if he thought that angela merkel would be easier to deal with than gerhard schröder .
that 's become obvious since merkel demanded that the us-run guantanamo prison camp on the island of cuba be shut down .
but it 's also clear now that she will be a reliable partner .
merkel thinks strategically , not tactically , and uses her statements to that effect . this chancellor does n't change foreign policy guidelines during town square rallies ; she does n't criticize allies during election campaign events .
instead , she first voices her concerns where it 's appropriate : in face-to-face meetings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also had clear words about alleged cia abductions during her meeting with rice in december during the berlin visit of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in december , merkel did n't leave any doubt about the fact that she considers the rule of law a priority even in the fight against terror .
that 's why the surprised reaction of the german public to her guantanamo remarks is the only astonishing thing about her statement .
bush certainly had been prepared for her words for at least four weeks . no surprises merkel 's public words are also nothing more than the reflection of a given consensus in europe .
but it 's also true that she is the first european head of government to issue clear demands on specific issues , be it the treatment of prisoners in guantanamo , the abduction of suspects or the establishing of secret cia prisons . specific criticism rather than blanket condemnation is something even george bush can deal with - especially since merkel always combines her remarks with a commitment to german-american friendship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel visited the us just prior to the war in iraq in 2003 the previous government used criticism of us actions ahead of the war in iraq to justify a general withdrawal of affection .
merkel takes a pragmatic approach instead .
specific criticism on the one hand and profound political support on the other are not mutually exclusive in her opinion .
quite to the contrary : only cooperating partners are able to resolve conflicts .
merkel is not suspected of anti-americanism and she uses the freedom to maneuver that comes with that . a critical partner her critical remarks ahead of her us visit have enabled her to widen the field even further .
she comes to washington with strong backing from the public and without any risk of capsizing .
nobody - especially merkel - expects the us government to fulfil even a single one of her demands .
she 's already getting applause just for raising the issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is gliding on a wave of public support at home bush on the other hand is facing a chancellor who will offer herself as a partner despite all the criticism .
she 's doing this from a strengthened position - strongly rooted in europe , with broad backing by her government and public support behind her . this angela merkel has much a better chance of being taken seriously in washington than her predecessor .
that 's crucial as germany has long disappeared from the top of the list of us priorities and was in danger of falling further under schröder . whether it is the united fight against terror , the cooperation with the -lrb- at best -rrb- semi-democratic russia or the nuclear row with iran - germany and europe can deal with these issues much more successfully at the us 's side rather than without or even in opposition to america . but washington expects at least political or economical - if not military - support in iraq from its partners .
knowing this , merkel has set the boundaries ahead of her visit in order to prevent the price of improved us-german relations from rising too high . uta thofern -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the united states for some of its tactics in the fight against terrorism and called for the guantanamo bay detention center to be closed in an interview published saturday .
-lrb- jan .
7 , 2006 -rrb- rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " after angela merkel said tuesday that the us admitted it erred in detaining a german national , rice 's aides challenged her comments , saying they were n't sure " what was in -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- head " when she said what she did .
-lrb- dec .
6 , 2005 -rrb- merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .
the statements come as her foreign minister begins a trip to the us .

dw-radio spoke with him about the dangers of bird flu for europeans . walter haas is head of the unit for respiratory diseases and immunization at the department for infectious disease epidemiology at the robert koch institute in germany .
he is the scientific coordinator of the german working group on influenza and of the expert committee on influenza pandemic preparedness planning in germany . dw-world : bird flu has entered europe - and the threat is coming closer to germany .
how well is are people prepared for it ? walter haas : first , let me state clearly that this is still an animal disease even though there are now 14 suspected cases .
still the majority of cases are still in animals , and the vast majority result from direct contact with sick animals . is there any danger that the more people that become infected with this disease , the more easily it could mutate and spread to more people ? well , of course , there is concern that this virus might change its way of distribution and spread at one point from human to human .
so far , we have no indication that this has happened .
however , one has to be very observant to be sure that there is no change .
the vast distribution -lrb- of the disease -rrb- in more than 10 countries among animals , of course , gives the virus the chance to change and to try and adapt to other hosts including humans .
there has been criticism that the number of cases has been underestimated .
is this true ? i think the cooperation as far as our information goes between the ministry of health in turkey , the world health organization and the eu has been very good .
of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .
and , of course , a lot of people that are concerned are going to be examined and that will lead to identification of cases that might have gone undetected otherwise . we know from other bacteria that even if they are frozen or cooked , they can survive these kind of extreme conditions .
is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .
and , of course , a lot of people that are concerned are going to be examined and that will lead to identification of cases that might have gone undetected otherwise . we know from other bacteria that even if they are frozen or cooked , they can survive these kind of extreme conditions .
is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.01.2006 business poised to fill growing social gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galatea fountains in stuttgart glisten thanks to a local company german firms have a long history of social involvement .
but increasingly companies are aiming to improve the bottom line along with society by using a publicity-friendly vehicle known as corporate social responsibility . if stuttgart ’ s public fountains are clean and in good repair , local metal-casting concern bornemann + haller may be the one to thank . the company is not in the fountain business , but in 2002 it " adopted " stuttgart ’ s fountains , taking responsibility for their repair and upkeep , together with the local government , as part of its “ goal-oriented company policy ” of social engagement . the move continues a long tradition of german firms taking an active role in communities , be they local or international .
in this case , a company official said the project was chosen even though " fountains are n't our business , " because the need was there and a top executive took an interest . finding a good fit while achim halfmann appreciates the corporate support for local projects , he 'd rather the random nature of it be replaced by with joint actions between business and communities that would help support various causes as well as the companies that fund them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against government cost-cutting reforms " businesses must learn to make the most of their social involvement , and see that it matches their product , their workers , their community - that it reflects what their company is about , " said halfmann , whose consulting company , public integration , ltd . , helps firms develop strategies for aiding their communities . german firms are certainly not laggards when it comes to corporate social responsibility , or csr . a recent eu study showed 54 percent of german companies took an active social role in the life of their communities , compared with an eu average of 49 percent . filling the gap but germany is still well behind european leader finland , where 83 percent of small and midsize companies are social do-gooders . " the anglo-saxon business world is far ahead of europe " when it comes to taking advantage of the opportunities csr presents , halfmann said .
" they 've been doing this for a long time . " yet csr seems poised to become even more important to the welfare of german business .
it stands to fill the gap between two conflicting trends : shrinking levels of social spending by the government and an increasing desire by shareholder to see that companies are doing something besides just looking to maximize profits . andreas gross , spokesman for the bda employers ' association , said : " csr ... has taken on a new dimension in the past two , maybe three years . ” his organization runs a web site , csrgermany.de , which lists german firms that have csr programs and the various forms they take . “ what has changed is that the public is much more aware of these issues , ” gross said , noting that germany ’ s manager magazin ran a ranking of companies ' csr activities for the first time last year . “ it is certainly relevant for companies that are listed on the stock exchange - they are more carefully watched , ” he added . bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest magazine has been helping german consumers for more than 40 years more and more , companies are realizing that investors as well as consumers are keeping a watchful eye .
germany ’ s respected consumer magazine stiftung warentest has started adding social criteria to its product ratings .
and woe to the company that gets on the wrong side of an environmental boycott , like the one that greenpeace started against shell after the oil company announced plans to sink a platform off the north sea a decade ago . ecopencils ? one example of a firm that has successfully tied its social activities to its market segment is europe ’ s biggest pencil maker , faber-castell .
more than a decade ago , the southern german firm developed a pioneering reforestation project in brazil .
the project - far from the rain forest - grows trees for its pencils while creating a sanctuary for protected species .
the company also developed environmentally friendly , water-soluble lacquers for its pencil coatings , winning kudos from the eu environment ministry .
and in 2000 , faber castell instituted a social charter that forbids child labor and supports equal opportunity and equal pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with these , consumers can jot notes with a good conscience such projects are often as much about good publicity as they are about deeply held belief , and the line between the two can be blurry . but in a 2005 study by the international consulting firm pleon , only 10 percent of companies admitted their csr activities were solely meant as pr . still , there are great gulfs in terms of credibility , said wolfgang stark , professor at the university of essen , in a recent deutschlandfunk radio interview . he called britain 's body shop a " beacon of virtue . "
the cosmetics firm is renowned for being built around socially responsible action .
but he also talked about companies that “ basically support csr projects in germany with their left hand , and support a system of exploitation in nigeria with the right . " " i think we will have to live a bit longer with this ambivalence , ” he added . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern . us president george w. bush was wrong if he thought that angela merkel would be easier to deal with than gerhard schröder .
that 's become obvious since merkel demanded that the us-run guantanamo prison camp on the island of cuba be shut down .
but it 's also clear now that she will be a reliable partner .
merkel thinks strategically , not tactically , and uses her statements to that effect . this chancellor does n't change foreign policy guidelines during town square rallies ; she does n't criticize allies during election campaign events .
instead , she first voices her concerns where it 's appropriate : in face-to-face meetings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also had clear words about alleged cia abductions during her meeting with rice in december during the berlin visit of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in december , merkel did n't leave any doubt about the fact that she considers the rule of law a priority even in the fight against terror .
that 's why the surprised reaction of the german public to her guantanamo remarks is the only astonishing thing about her statement .
bush certainly had been prepared for her words for at least four weeks . no surprises merkel 's public words are also nothing more than the reflection of a given consensus in europe .
but it 's also true that she is the first european head of government to issue clear demands on specific issues , be it the treatment of prisoners in guantanamo , the abduction of suspects or the establishing of secret cia prisons . specific criticism rather than blanket condemnation is something even george bush can deal with - especially since merkel always combines her remarks with a commitment to german-american friendship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel visited the us just prior to the war in iraq in 2003 the previous government used criticism of us actions ahead of the war in iraq to justify a general withdrawal of affection .
merkel takes a pragmatic approach instead .
specific criticism on the one hand and profound political support on the other are not mutually exclusive in her opinion .
quite to the contrary : only cooperating partners are able to resolve conflicts .
merkel is not suspected of anti-americanism and she uses the freedom to maneuver that comes with that . a critical partner her critical remarks ahead of her us visit have enabled her to widen the field even further .
she comes to washington with strong backing from the public and without any risk of capsizing .
nobody - especially merkel - expects the us government to fulfil even a single one of her demands .
she 's already getting applause just for raising the issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is gliding on a wave of public support at home bush on the other hand is facing a chancellor who will offer herself as a partner despite all the criticism .
she 's doing this from a strengthened position - strongly rooted in europe , with broad backing by her government and public support behind her . this angela merkel has much a better chance of being taken seriously in washington than her predecessor .
that 's crucial as germany has long disappeared from the top of the list of us priorities and was in danger of falling further under schröder . whether it is the united fight against terror , the cooperation with the -lrb- at best -rrb- semi-democratic russia or the nuclear row with iran - germany and europe can deal with these issues much more successfully at the us 's side rather than without or even in opposition to america . but washington expects at least political or economical - if not military - support in iraq from its partners .
knowing this , merkel has set the boundaries ahead of her visit in order to prevent the price of improved us-german relations from rising too high . uta thofern -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the united states for some of its tactics in the fight against terrorism and called for the guantanamo bay detention center to be closed in an interview published saturday .

dw-radio spoke with him about the dangers of bird flu for europeans . walter haas is head of the unit for respiratory diseases and immunization at the department for infectious disease epidemiology at the robert koch institute in germany .
he is the scientific coordinator of the german working group on influenza and of the expert committee on influenza pandemic preparedness planning in germany . dw-world : bird flu has entered europe - and the threat is coming closer to germany .
how well is are people prepared for it ? walter haas : first , let me state clearly that this is still an animal disease even though there are now 14 suspected cases .
still the majority of cases are still in animals , and the vast majority result from direct contact with sick animals . is there any danger that the more people that become infected with this disease , the more easily it could mutate and spread to more people ? well , of course , there is concern that this virus might change its way of distribution and spread at one point from human to human .
so far , we have no indication that this has happened .
however , one has to be very observant to be sure that there is no change .
the vast distribution -lrb- of the disease -rrb- in more than 10 countries among animals , of course , gives the virus the chance to change and to try and adapt to other hosts including humans .
there has been criticism that the number of cases has been underestimated .
is this true ? i think the cooperation as far as our information goes between the ministry of health in turkey , the world health organization and the eu has been very good .
of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .
and , of course , a lot of people that are concerned are going to be examined and that will lead to identification of cases that might have gone undetected otherwise . we know from other bacteria that even if they are frozen or cooked , they can survive these kind of extreme conditions .
is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

10 , 2006 -rrb- bird flu infections suspected in istanbul the bird flu virus appears to be moving westward as more humans have been infected in turkey .
while several tested positive for the deadly strain in the capital ankara , people in istanbul have been hospitalized .
-lrb- jan .
9 , 2006 -rrb- dead birds raise virus scare in germany the discovery of more than 20 dead birds at a pond in western germany has raised fears that avian flu may have already found its way into the country , though officials are urging the public to remain calm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.01.2006 business poised to fill growing social gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galatea fountains in stuttgart glisten thanks to a local company german firms have a long history of social involvement .
but increasingly companies are aiming to improve the bottom line along with society by using a publicity-friendly vehicle known as corporate social responsibility . if stuttgart ’ s public fountains are clean and in good repair , local metal-casting concern bornemann + haller may be the one to thank . the company is not in the fountain business , but in 2002 it " adopted " stuttgart ’ s fountains , taking responsibility for their repair and upkeep , together with the local government , as part of its “ goal-oriented company policy ” of social engagement . the move continues a long tradition of german firms taking an active role in communities , be they local or international .
in this case , a company official said the project was chosen even though " fountains are n't our business , " because the need was there and a top executive took an interest . finding a good fit while achim halfmann appreciates the corporate support for local projects , he 'd rather the random nature of it be replaced by with joint actions between business and communities that would help support various causes as well as the companies that fund them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against government cost-cutting reforms " businesses must learn to make the most of their social involvement , and see that it matches their product , their workers , their community - that it reflects what their company is about , " said halfmann , whose consulting company , public integration , ltd . , helps firms develop strategies for aiding their communities . german firms are certainly not laggards when it comes to corporate social responsibility , or csr . a recent eu study showed 54 percent of german companies took an active social role in the life of their communities , compared with an eu average of 49 percent . filling the gap but germany is still well behind european leader finland , where 83 percent of small and midsize companies are social do-gooders . " the anglo-saxon business world is far ahead of europe " when it comes to taking advantage of the opportunities csr presents , halfmann said .
" they 've been doing this for a long time . " yet csr seems poised to become even more important to the welfare of german business .
it stands to fill the gap between two conflicting trends : shrinking levels of social spending by the government and an increasing desire by shareholder to see that companies are doing something besides just looking to maximize profits . andreas gross , spokesman for the bda employers ' association , said : " csr ... has taken on a new dimension in the past two , maybe three years . ” his organization runs a web site , csrgermany.de , which lists german firms that have csr programs and the various forms they take . “ what has changed is that the public is much more aware of these issues , ” gross said , noting that germany ’ s manager magazin ran a ranking of companies ' csr activities for the first time last year . “ it is certainly relevant for companies that are listed on the stock exchange - they are more carefully watched , ” he added . bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest magazine has been helping german consumers for more than 40 years more and more , companies are realizing that investors as well as consumers are keeping a watchful eye .
germany ’ s respected consumer magazine stiftung warentest has started adding social criteria to its product ratings .
and woe to the company that gets on the wrong side of an environmental boycott , like the one that greenpeace started against shell after the oil company announced plans to sink a platform off the north sea a decade ago . ecopencils ? one example of a firm that has successfully tied its social activities to its market segment is europe ’ s biggest pencil maker , faber-castell .
more than a decade ago , the southern german firm developed a pioneering reforestation project in brazil .
the project - far from the rain forest - grows trees for its pencils while creating a sanctuary for protected species .
the company also developed environmentally friendly , water-soluble lacquers for its pencil coatings , winning kudos from the eu environment ministry .
and in 2000 , faber castell instituted a social charter that forbids child labor and supports equal opportunity and equal pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with these , consumers can jot notes with a good conscience such projects are often as much about good publicity as they are about deeply held belief , and the line between the two can be blurry . but in a 2005 study by the international consulting firm pleon , only 10 percent of companies admitted their csr activities were solely meant as pr . still , there are great gulfs in terms of credibility , said wolfgang stark , professor at the university of essen , in a recent deutschlandfunk radio interview . he called britain 's body shop a " beacon of virtue . "
the cosmetics firm is renowned for being built around socially responsible action .
but he also talked about companies that “ basically support csr projects in germany with their left hand , and support a system of exploitation in nigeria with the right . " " i think we will have to live a bit longer with this ambivalence , ” he added . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern . us president george w. bush was wrong if he thought that angela merkel would be easier to deal with than gerhard schröder .
that 's become obvious since merkel demanded that the us-run guantanamo prison camp on the island of cuba be shut down .
but it 's also clear now that she will be a reliable partner .
merkel thinks strategically , not tactically , and uses her statements to that effect . this chancellor does n't change foreign policy guidelines during town square rallies ; she does n't criticize allies during election campaign events .
instead , she first voices her concerns where it 's appropriate : in face-to-face meetings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also had clear words about alleged cia abductions during her meeting with rice in december during the berlin visit of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in december , merkel did n't leave any doubt about the fact that she considers the rule of law a priority even in the fight against terror .
that 's why the surprised reaction of the german public to her guantanamo remarks is the only astonishing thing about her statement .
bush certainly had been prepared for her words for at least four weeks . no surprises merkel 's public words are also nothing more than the reflection of a given consensus in europe .
but it 's also true that she is the first european head of government to issue clear demands on specific issues , be it the treatment of prisoners in guantanamo , the abduction of suspects or the establishing of secret cia prisons . specific criticism rather than blanket condemnation is something even george bush can deal with - especially since merkel always combines her remarks with a commitment to german-american friendship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel visited the us just prior to the war in iraq in 2003 the previous government used criticism of us actions ahead of the war in iraq to justify a general withdrawal of affection .
merkel takes a pragmatic approach instead .
specific criticism on the one hand and profound political support on the other are not mutually exclusive in her opinion .
quite to the contrary : only cooperating partners are able to resolve conflicts .
merkel is not suspected of anti-americanism and she uses the freedom to maneuver that comes with that . a critical partner her critical remarks ahead of her us visit have enabled her to widen the field even further .
she comes to washington with strong backing from the public and without any risk of capsizing .
nobody - especially merkel - expects the us government to fulfil even a single one of her demands .
she 's already getting applause just for raising the issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is gliding on a wave of public support at home bush on the other hand is facing a chancellor who will offer herself as a partner despite all the criticism .
she 's doing this from a strengthened position - strongly rooted in europe , with broad backing by her government and public support behind her . this angela merkel has much a better chance of being taken seriously in washington than her predecessor .
that 's crucial as germany has long disappeared from the top of the list of us priorities and was in danger of falling further under schröder . whether it is the united fight against terror , the cooperation with the -lrb- at best -rrb- semi-democratic russia or the nuclear row with iran - germany and europe can deal with these issues much more successfully at the us 's side rather than without or even in opposition to america . but washington expects at least political or economical - if not military - support in iraq from its partners .

she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern . us president george w. bush was wrong if he thought that angela merkel would be easier to deal with than gerhard schröder .
that 's become obvious since merkel demanded that the us-run guantanamo prison camp on the island of cuba be shut down .
but it 's also clear now that she will be a reliable partner .
merkel thinks strategically , not tactically , and uses her statements to that effect . this chancellor does n't change foreign policy guidelines during town square rallies ; she does n't criticize allies during election campaign events .
instead , she first voices her concerns where it 's appropriate : in face-to-face meetings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also had clear words about alleged cia abductions during her meeting with rice in december during the berlin visit of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in december , merkel did n't leave any doubt about the fact that she considers the rule of law a priority even in the fight against terror .
that 's why the surprised reaction of the german public to her guantanamo remarks is the only astonishing thing about her statement .
bush certainly had been prepared for her words for at least four weeks . no surprises merkel 's public words are also nothing more than the reflection of a given consensus in europe .
but it 's also true that she is the first european head of government to issue clear demands on specific issues , be it the treatment of prisoners in guantanamo , the abduction of suspects or the establishing of secret cia prisons . specific criticism rather than blanket condemnation is something even george bush can deal with - especially since merkel always combines her remarks with a commitment to german-american friendship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel visited the us just prior to the war in iraq in 2003 the previous government used criticism of us actions ahead of the war in iraq to justify a general withdrawal of affection .
merkel takes a pragmatic approach instead .
specific criticism on the one hand and profound political support on the other are not mutually exclusive in her opinion .
quite to the contrary : only cooperating partners are able to resolve conflicts .
merkel is not suspected of anti-americanism and she uses the freedom to maneuver that comes with that . a critical partner her critical remarks ahead of her us visit have enabled her to widen the field even further .
she comes to washington with strong backing from the public and without any risk of capsizing .
nobody - especially merkel - expects the us government to fulfil even a single one of her demands .
she 's already getting applause just for raising the issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is gliding on a wave of public support at home bush on the other hand is facing a chancellor who will offer herself as a partner despite all the criticism .
she 's doing this from a strengthened position - strongly rooted in europe , with broad backing by her government and public support behind her . this angela merkel has much a better chance of being taken seriously in washington than her predecessor .
that 's crucial as germany has long disappeared from the top of the list of us priorities and was in danger of falling further under schröder . whether it is the united fight against terror , the cooperation with the -lrb- at best -rrb- semi-democratic russia or the nuclear row with iran - germany and europe can deal with these issues much more successfully at the us 's side rather than without or even in opposition to america . but washington expects at least political or economical - if not military - support in iraq from its partners .

but increasingly companies are aiming to improve the bottom line along with society by using a publicity-friendly vehicle known as corporate social responsibility . if stuttgart ’ s public fountains are clean and in good repair , local metal-casting concern bornemann + haller may be the one to thank . the company is not in the fountain business , but in 2002 it " adopted " stuttgart ’ s fountains , taking responsibility for their repair and upkeep , together with the local government , as part of its “ goal-oriented company policy ” of social engagement . the move continues a long tradition of german firms taking an active role in communities , be they local or international .
in this case , a company official said the project was chosen even though " fountains are n't our business , " because the need was there and a top executive took an interest . finding a good fit while achim halfmann appreciates the corporate support for local projects , he 'd rather the random nature of it be replaced by with joint actions between business and communities that would help support various causes as well as the companies that fund them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against government cost-cutting reforms " businesses must learn to make the most of their social involvement , and see that it matches their product , their workers , their community - that it reflects what their company is about , " said halfmann , whose consulting company , public integration , ltd . , helps firms develop strategies for aiding their communities . german firms are certainly not laggards when it comes to corporate social responsibility , or csr . a recent eu study showed 54 percent of german companies took an active social role in the life of their communities , compared with an eu average of 49 percent . filling the gap but germany is still well behind european leader finland , where 83 percent of small and midsize companies are social do-gooders . " the anglo-saxon business world is far ahead of europe " when it comes to taking advantage of the opportunities csr presents , halfmann said .
" they 've been doing this for a long time . " yet csr seems poised to become even more important to the welfare of german business .
it stands to fill the gap between two conflicting trends : shrinking levels of social spending by the government and an increasing desire by shareholder to see that companies are doing something besides just looking to maximize profits . andreas gross , spokesman for the bda employers ' association , said : " csr ... has taken on a new dimension in the past two , maybe three years . ” his organization runs a web site , csrgermany.de , which lists german firms that have csr programs and the various forms they take . “ what has changed is that the public is much more aware of these issues , ” gross said , noting that germany ’ s manager magazin ran a ranking of companies ' csr activities for the first time last year . “ it is certainly relevant for companies that are listed on the stock exchange - they are more carefully watched , ” he added . bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest magazine has been helping german consumers for more than 40 years more and more , companies are realizing that investors as well as consumers are keeping a watchful eye .
germany ’ s respected consumer magazine stiftung warentest has started adding social criteria to its product ratings .
and woe to the company that gets on the wrong side of an environmental boycott , like the one that greenpeace started against shell after the oil company announced plans to sink a platform off the north sea a decade ago . ecopencils ? one example of a firm that has successfully tied its social activities to its market segment is europe ’ s biggest pencil maker , faber-castell .
more than a decade ago , the southern german firm developed a pioneering reforestation project in brazil .
the project - far from the rain forest - grows trees for its pencils while creating a sanctuary for protected species .
the company also developed environmentally friendly , water-soluble lacquers for its pencil coatings , winning kudos from the eu environment ministry .
and in 2000 , faber castell instituted a social charter that forbids child labor and supports equal opportunity and equal pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with these , consumers can jot notes with a good conscience such projects are often as much about good publicity as they are about deeply held belief , and the line between the two can be blurry . but in a 2005 study by the international consulting firm pleon , only 10 percent of companies admitted their csr activities were solely meant as pr . still , there are great gulfs in terms of credibility , said wolfgang stark , professor at the university of essen , in a recent deutschlandfunk radio interview . he called britain 's body shop a " beacon of virtue . "
the cosmetics firm is renowned for being built around socially responsible action .
but he also talked about companies that “ basically support csr projects in germany with their left hand , and support a system of exploitation in nigeria with the right . " " i think we will have to live a bit longer with this ambivalence , ” he added . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany -pipe- 10.01.2006 transatlantic relations with a " series of problems " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house is set to welcome merkel to washington this week german chancellor angela merkel heads to washington on thursday for her two-day inaugural visit .
dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .

dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .

dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .

but the program comes at the cost of fresh borrowing and a value-added tax hike in 2007 which may nip in the bud any temporary upswing . at their two-day strategy meeting at a castle near berlin , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet ministers as well as other christian and social democrat leaders approved a 25-billion-euro spending program which they sold as just the right tool to kick-start the sluggish economy . while details on how much would be spent and on what remained undisclosed on monday , the allocated money is certain to go into research and infrastructure projects .

dw-radio spoke with him about the dangers of bird flu for europeans . walter haas is head of the unit for respiratory diseases and immunization at the department for infectious disease epidemiology at the robert koch institute in germany .
he is the scientific coordinator of the german working group on influenza and of the expert committee on influenza pandemic preparedness planning in germany . dw-world : bird flu has entered europe - and the threat is coming closer to germany .
how well is are people prepared for it ? walter haas : first , let me state clearly that this is still an animal disease even though there are now 14 suspected cases .
still the majority of cases are still in animals , and the vast majority result from direct contact with sick animals . is there any danger that the more people that become infected with this disease , the more easily it could mutate and spread to more people ? well , of course , there is concern that this virus might change its way of distribution and spread at one point from human to human .
so far , we have no indication that this has happened .
however , one has to be very observant to be sure that there is no change .
the vast distribution -lrb- of the disease -rrb- in more than 10 countries among animals , of course , gives the virus the chance to change and to try and adapt to other hosts including humans .
there has been criticism that the number of cases has been underestimated .
is this true ? i think the cooperation as far as our information goes between the ministry of health in turkey , the world health organization and the eu has been very good .
of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .
and , of course , a lot of people that are concerned are going to be examined and that will lead to identification of cases that might have gone undetected otherwise . we know from other bacteria that even if they are frozen or cooked , they can survive these kind of extreme conditions .
is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

dw-radio spoke with him about the dangers of bird flu for europeans . walter haas is head of the unit for respiratory diseases and immunization at the department for infectious disease epidemiology at the robert koch institute in germany .
he is the scientific coordinator of the german working group on influenza and of the expert committee on influenza pandemic preparedness planning in germany . dw-world : bird flu has entered europe - and the threat is coming closer to germany .
how well is are people prepared for it ? walter haas : first , let me state clearly that this is still an animal disease even though there are now 14 suspected cases .
still the majority of cases are still in animals , and the vast majority result from direct contact with sick animals . is there any danger that the more people that become infected with this disease , the more easily it could mutate and spread to more people ? well , of course , there is concern that this virus might change its way of distribution and spread at one point from human to human .
so far , we have no indication that this has happened .
however , one has to be very observant to be sure that there is no change .
the vast distribution -lrb- of the disease -rrb- in more than 10 countries among animals , of course , gives the virus the chance to change and to try and adapt to other hosts including humans .
there has been criticism that the number of cases has been underestimated .
is this true ? i think the cooperation as far as our information goes between the ministry of health in turkey , the world health organization and the eu has been very good .
of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .
and , of course , a lot of people that are concerned are going to be examined and that will lead to identification of cases that might have gone undetected otherwise . we know from other bacteria that even if they are frozen or cooked , they can survive these kind of extreme conditions .
is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

german soccer officials have rejected the accusations . stiftung warentest , an independent consumer protection watchdog respected throughout germany for its rating of consumer products and services , released a study showing that world cup stadium venues were ill-equipped to cope with disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist falk murke , right , and jürgen ambrecht of consumer magazine " stiftung warentest " according to the authors of the study , which examined the stadiums last september and october , two-thirds of the venues to be used during this summer 's world cup failed to comply with security guidelines established by the international soccer body fifa . lessons never learned although safety in general has improved since the 1980s when multiple fatalities at the heysel , bradford and hillsborough soccer stadiums in england hit the headlines , deficiencies still persist , the study said .
what 's more , it added , many of the lessons stadium builders should have drawn from past disasters seem to have been ignored . a close look at evacuation routes found , for example , that many of the stadiums had no plan to allow fans to enter the pitch in case of a mass panic .
three of the four world cup stadiums marked as having " serious deficiencies " – gelsenkirchen , leipzig and berlin – were not prepared for a mass evacuation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new multi-million euro stadium in leipzig does n't meet security requirements , the report says crowd panic , set off by a bomb warning or a rowdy brawl , could have fatal consequences , stiftung warentest concluded .
the fourth , fritz walter in the city of kaserslautern , was reported to have serious faults in terms of fire protection . " the results were sobering .
many of the conclusions drawn 20 years ago have either been forgotten or partly ignored , " holger brackmann , department chief at the consumer watchdog , said at a news conference . besides the four described with " serious deficiencies , " the consumer group sighted shortcomings in four other stadiums , including munich 's dazzling new arena that will host the opening match on june 9 .
an additional four venues were rated as having " clear failings . " unwanted criticism ? the stiftung warentest study , some aspects of which were leaked in advance , has sparked an angry reaction from the president of the world cup 's organizing committee , franz beckenbauer -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer " stiftung warentest may know about face lotions , olive oils and vacuums .
that 's what they should stick with , " he told the mass-circulation daily bild . " i 'm really sick and tired of the army of know-it-alls trying to lift their profile at the expense of the world cup , " beckenbauer said . according to peter peters , manager of gelsenkirchen-based schalke 04 , the magazine was only interested in a circulation boost with its explosive report . " stiftung warentest is making itself look ridiculous with their results , " he said . for its part , the consumer protection group defended its article , saying it had given organizers five months to improve matters .
it is also not the first time the group has tested stadium safety . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " considerable " defects found in world cup stadiums five months before the opening game , a respected german consumer magazine said its test of germany 's 12 world cup venues uncovered safety problems that could have a " devastating effect " in the event of mass panic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany -pipe- 10.01.2006 transatlantic relations with a " series of problems " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house is set to welcome merkel to washington this week german chancellor angela merkel heads to washington on thursday for her two-day inaugural visit .
dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .

dw-radio spoke with him about the dangers of bird flu for europeans . walter haas is head of the unit for respiratory diseases and immunization at the department for infectious disease epidemiology at the robert koch institute in germany .
he is the scientific coordinator of the german working group on influenza and of the expert committee on influenza pandemic preparedness planning in germany . dw-world : bird flu has entered europe - and the threat is coming closer to germany .
how well is are people prepared for it ? walter haas : first , let me state clearly that this is still an animal disease even though there are now 14 suspected cases .
still the majority of cases are still in animals , and the vast majority result from direct contact with sick animals . is there any danger that the more people that become infected with this disease , the more easily it could mutate and spread to more people ? well , of course , there is concern that this virus might change its way of distribution and spread at one point from human to human .
so far , we have no indication that this has happened .
however , one has to be very observant to be sure that there is no change .
the vast distribution -lrb- of the disease -rrb- in more than 10 countries among animals , of course , gives the virus the chance to change and to try and adapt to other hosts including humans .
there has been criticism that the number of cases has been underestimated .
is this true ? i think the cooperation as far as our information goes between the ministry of health in turkey , the world health organization and the eu has been very good .
of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .

is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

dw-radio spoke with him about the dangers of bird flu for europeans . walter haas is head of the unit for respiratory diseases and immunization at the department for infectious disease epidemiology at the robert koch institute in germany .
he is the scientific coordinator of the german working group on influenza and of the expert committee on influenza pandemic preparedness planning in germany . dw-world : bird flu has entered europe - and the threat is coming closer to germany .
how well is are people prepared for it ? walter haas : first , let me state clearly that this is still an animal disease even though there are now 14 suspected cases .
still the majority of cases are still in animals , and the vast majority result from direct contact with sick animals . is there any danger that the more people that become infected with this disease , the more easily it could mutate and spread to more people ? well , of course , there is concern that this virus might change its way of distribution and spread at one point from human to human .
so far , we have no indication that this has happened .
however , one has to be very observant to be sure that there is no change .
the vast distribution -lrb- of the disease -rrb- in more than 10 countries among animals , of course , gives the virus the chance to change and to try and adapt to other hosts including humans .
there has been criticism that the number of cases has been underestimated .
is this true ? i think the cooperation as far as our information goes between the ministry of health in turkey , the world health organization and the eu has been very good .
of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .
and , of course , a lot of people that are concerned are going to be examined and that will lead to identification of cases that might have gone undetected otherwise . we know from other bacteria that even if they are frozen or cooked , they can survive these kind of extreme conditions .
is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany -pipe- 10.01.2006 transatlantic relations with a " series of problems " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house is set to welcome merkel to washington this week german chancellor angela merkel heads to washington on thursday for her two-day inaugural visit .
dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.01.2006 german media board rejects springer 's takeover plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer ceo döpfner -lrb- left -rrb- might have to return prosiebensat.1 to haim saban -lrb- right -rrb- germany 's watchdog on media concentration tuesday rejected plans by publishing giant springer to take over private broadcaster prosiebensat.1 , making it highly unlikely that the merger will go through . the decision by the so-called commission to investigate media concentration -lrb- kek -rrb- came shortly after reports that germany 's antitrust office , the federal cartel office , is also likely to reject the 3.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.32-billion -rrb- merger .
an official decision of the latter is expected by the end of next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are pope " was the headline in bild when german-born benedict xvi was elected springer 's media empire is currently largely focussed on the print sector , the mass-circulation bild tabloid with roughly 12 million readers being its crown jewel .
last august , springer announced that it had agreed to buy prosiebensat.1 - germany 's largest private television group - from a group of us investors . kek officials said the merger would bring together too many different media under one roof , resulting in a " dominant power of opinion " for the newly formed company . the cartel office has voiced concerns about the effects the takeover would have on the advertising market for both the television and print market .
it has given springer until thursday to come up with a new proposal . springer defends deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosiebensat.1 satellite dishes in berlin if springer holds on to bild , it is - under federal anti-monopoly rules - not allowed to own one of the main prosiebensat.1 television channels - either sat.1 or prosieben - which would devalue the worth of any deal . springer ceo matthias döpfner on tuesday meanwhile defended the proposed takeover , saying that the control bodies were overlooking global and digital shifts in the media world . he added that the company would look for other ventures outside germany if the deal is rejected . " we will take that and try our luck in the digital markets and abroad , " he said , according to the ap news service . bringing in a partner ? according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , springer is also contemplating bringing in sbs broadcasting , which owns private commercial television and radio stations in western and central europe .
sbs could then buy prosieben or sat.1 to win approval from the deal .
springer officials declined to comment on the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer headquarters in berlin the kek 's decision is not final , however , as springer officials can still call on germany 's state media boards , who could overturn the rejection of the deal . but jörg tauss , the media policy expert for germany 's social democrats in parliament , called on the directors of state media boards not to take such a step .
he welcomed the kek decision , saying that it guaranteed media diversity in germany . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-cartel office rejects springer 's prosieben takeover germany 's anti-cartel office has rejected an offer by newspaper publisher axel springer to buy commercial television group prosiebensat1 despite proposed concessions .

she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern . us president george w. bush was wrong if he thought that angela merkel would be easier to deal with than gerhard schröder .
that 's become obvious since merkel demanded that the us-run guantanamo prison camp on the island of cuba be shut down .
but it 's also clear now that she will be a reliable partner .
merkel thinks strategically , not tactically , and uses her statements to that effect . this chancellor does n't change foreign policy guidelines during town square rallies ; she does n't criticize allies during election campaign events .
instead , she first voices her concerns where it 's appropriate : in face-to-face meetings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also had clear words about alleged cia abductions during her meeting with rice in december during the berlin visit of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in december , merkel did n't leave any doubt about the fact that she considers the rule of law a priority even in the fight against terror .
that 's why the surprised reaction of the german public to her guantanamo remarks is the only astonishing thing about her statement .
bush certainly had been prepared for her words for at least four weeks . no surprises merkel 's public words are also nothing more than the reflection of a given consensus in europe .
but it 's also true that she is the first european head of government to issue clear demands on specific issues , be it the treatment of prisoners in guantanamo , the abduction of suspects or the establishing of secret cia prisons . specific criticism rather than blanket condemnation is something even george bush can deal with - especially since merkel always combines her remarks with a commitment to german-american friendship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel visited the us just prior to the war in iraq in 2003 the previous government used criticism of us actions ahead of the war in iraq to justify a general withdrawal of affection .
merkel takes a pragmatic approach instead .
specific criticism on the one hand and profound political support on the other are not mutually exclusive in her opinion .
quite to the contrary : only cooperating partners are able to resolve conflicts .
merkel is not suspected of anti-americanism and she uses the freedom to maneuver that comes with that . a critical partner her critical remarks ahead of her us visit have enabled her to widen the field even further .
she comes to washington with strong backing from the public and without any risk of capsizing .
nobody - especially merkel - expects the us government to fulfil even a single one of her demands .
she 's already getting applause just for raising the issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is gliding on a wave of public support at home bush on the other hand is facing a chancellor who will offer herself as a partner despite all the criticism .
she 's doing this from a strengthened position - strongly rooted in europe , with broad backing by her government and public support behind her . this angela merkel has much a better chance of being taken seriously in washington than her predecessor .
that 's crucial as germany has long disappeared from the top of the list of us priorities and was in danger of falling further under schröder . whether it is the united fight against terror , the cooperation with the -lrb- at best -rrb- semi-democratic russia or the nuclear row with iran - germany and europe can deal with these issues much more successfully at the us 's side rather than without or even in opposition to america . but washington expects at least political or economical - if not military - support in iraq from its partners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany -pipe- 10.01.2006 opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll understand each other german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .
she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern . us president george w. bush was wrong if he thought that angela merkel would be easier to deal with than gerhard schröder .
that 's become obvious since merkel demanded that the us-run guantanamo prison camp on the island of cuba be shut down .
but it 's also clear now that she will be a reliable partner .
merkel thinks strategically , not tactically , and uses her statements to that effect . this chancellor does n't change foreign policy guidelines during town square rallies ; she does n't criticize allies during election campaign events .
instead , she first voices her concerns where it 's appropriate : in face-to-face meetings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also had clear words about alleged cia abductions during her meeting with rice in december during the berlin visit of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in december , merkel did n't leave any doubt about the fact that she considers the rule of law a priority even in the fight against terror .
that 's why the surprised reaction of the german public to her guantanamo remarks is the only astonishing thing about her statement .
bush certainly had been prepared for her words for at least four weeks . no surprises merkel 's public words are also nothing more than the reflection of a given consensus in europe .
but it 's also true that she is the first european head of government to issue clear demands on specific issues , be it the treatment of prisoners in guantanamo , the abduction of suspects or the establishing of secret cia prisons . specific criticism rather than blanket condemnation is something even george bush can deal with - especially since merkel always combines her remarks with a commitment to german-american friendship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel visited the us just prior to the war in iraq in 2003 the previous government used criticism of us actions ahead of the war in iraq to justify a general withdrawal of affection .
merkel takes a pragmatic approach instead .
specific criticism on the one hand and profound political support on the other are not mutually exclusive in her opinion .
quite to the contrary : only cooperating partners are able to resolve conflicts .
merkel is not suspected of anti-americanism and she uses the freedom to maneuver that comes with that . a critical partner her critical remarks ahead of her us visit have enabled her to widen the field even further .
she comes to washington with strong backing from the public and without any risk of capsizing .
nobody - especially merkel - expects the us government to fulfil even a single one of her demands .
she 's already getting applause just for raising the issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is gliding on a wave of public support at home bush on the other hand is facing a chancellor who will offer herself as a partner despite all the criticism .
she 's doing this from a strengthened position - strongly rooted in europe , with broad backing by her government and public support behind her . this angela merkel has much a better chance of being taken seriously in washington than her predecessor .
that 's crucial as germany has long disappeared from the top of the list of us priorities and was in danger of falling further under schröder . whether it is the united fight against terror , the cooperation with the -lrb- at best -rrb- semi-democratic russia or the nuclear row with iran - germany and europe can deal with these issues much more successfully at the us 's side rather than without or even in opposition to america . but washington expects at least political or economical - if not military - support in iraq from its partners .
knowing this , merkel has set the boundaries ahead of her visit in order to prevent the price of improved us-german relations from rising too high . uta thofern -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the united states for some of its tactics in the fight against terrorism and called for the guantanamo bay detention center to be closed in an interview published saturday .

but the program comes at the cost of fresh borrowing and a value-added tax hike in 2007 which may nip in the bud any temporary upswing . at their two-day strategy meeting at a castle near berlin , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet ministers as well as other christian and social democrat leaders approved a 25-billion-euro spending program which they sold as just the right tool to kick-start the sluggish economy . while details on how much would be spent and on what remained undisclosed on monday , the allocated money is certain to go into research and infrastructure projects .

dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .

dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2006 german government approves multi-billion investment program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cabinet ministers discuss germany 's future near berlin germany 's government of christian and social democrats has sent out a signal of industriousness by approving a 25-billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2-billion -rrb- growth and investment package to take effect this year . the state-funded shot in the arm for the ailing german economy is meant to boost consumer confidence and create new jobs .
but the program comes at the cost of fresh borrowing and a value-added tax hike in 2007 which may nip in the bud any temporary upswing . at their two-day strategy meeting at a castle near berlin , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet ministers as well as other christian and social democrat leaders approved a 25-billion-euro spending program which they sold as just the right tool to kick-start the sluggish economy . while details on how much would be spent and on what remained undisclosed on monday , the allocated money is certain to go into research and infrastructure projects .
it 'll also be used to ensure favorable tax treatment for capital investment and housing to provide incentives particularly to the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises . private investment incentive " we 're first and foremost talking about incentives for more growth and employment , " said labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering .
" the 25 billion euros from the state will only be half of the equation with the ensuing increase in private investment being equally important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen christian democrat family minister ursula von der leyen said she is glad that part of the money will also go into more support for young families . " it 's our aim to give families with small children a better deal , " she said .
" the parents concerned are usually only at the beginning of their careers and tend to have relatively small incomes .
at the same time , they face higher costs in bringing up their kids .
so it 's only fair to offer them some sort of financial compensation . " opposition calls program " ridiculous " opposition liberal democrat leader guido westerwelle however countered that the harmony radiating from the government 's meeting is ridiculous if one looks at the expected impact of the spending program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle wanted to join merkel in a center-right coalition government " this growth and investment program is a flash in the pan , " he said .
" it 's based on fresh borrowing and wo n't have a long-term impact , because it does n't really address any of this country 's structural deficits . " opposition greens leader claudia roth does n't think much of the program , either . " it does n't strike me as very logical that the government should now lay on a massive investment program , while it 'll raise value-added tax next year with a view to getting the money back from people immediately , " she said . no other breakthroughs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late night talks did n't lead to any other decisions the government 's strategy meeting , which ends on tuesday , is not expected to result in breakthroughs in a number of other policy fields . christian and social democrat ministers said on monday that a long-term plan for the country 's energy policy and the future use of nuclear power in particular would only be adopted at a summit meeting in the spring . there wo n't be any tangible progress either towards a compromise on long overdue health service reforms . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government retreats to re-think germany 's future the german government is holding a two-day strategy meeting meant to bring both sides of the " grand coalition " into harmony .
among other things , ministers will deal with a planned multi-billion investment program .

german soccer officials have rejected the accusations . stiftung warentest , an independent consumer protection watchdog respected throughout germany for its rating of consumer products and services , released a study showing that world cup stadium venues were ill-equipped to cope with disaster . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalist falk murke , right , and jürgen ambrecht of consumer magazine " stiftung warentest " according to the authors of the study , which examined the stadiums last september and october , two-thirds of the venues to be used during this summer 's world cup failed to comply with security guidelines established by the international soccer body fifa . lessons never learned although safety in general has improved since the 1980s when multiple fatalities at the heysel , bradford and hillsborough soccer stadiums in england hit the headlines , deficiencies still persist , the study said .
what 's more , it added , many of the lessons stadium builders should have drawn from past disasters seem to have been ignored . a close look at evacuation routes found , for example , that many of the stadiums had no plan to allow fans to enter the pitch in case of a mass panic .
three of the four world cup stadiums marked as having " serious deficiencies " – gelsenkirchen , leipzig and berlin – were not prepared for a mass evacuation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new multi-million euro stadium in leipzig does n't meet security requirements , the report says crowd panic , set off by a bomb warning or a rowdy brawl , could have fatal consequences , stiftung warentest concluded .
the fourth , fritz walter in the city of kaserslautern , was reported to have serious faults in terms of fire protection . " the results were sobering .
many of the conclusions drawn 20 years ago have either been forgotten or partly ignored , " holger brackmann , department chief at the consumer watchdog , said at a news conference . besides the four described with " serious deficiencies , " the consumer group sighted shortcomings in four other stadiums , including munich 's dazzling new arena that will host the opening match on june 9 .
an additional four venues were rated as having " clear failings . " unwanted criticism ? the stiftung warentest study , some aspects of which were leaked in advance , has sparked an angry reaction from the president of the world cup 's organizing committee , franz beckenbauer -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer " stiftung warentest may know about face lotions , olive oils and vacuums .
that 's what they should stick with , " he told the mass-circulation daily bild . " i 'm really sick and tired of the army of know-it-alls trying to lift their profile at the expense of the world cup , " beckenbauer said . according to peter peters , manager of gelsenkirchen-based schalke 04 , the magazine was only interested in a circulation boost with its explosive report . " stiftung warentest is making itself look ridiculous with their results , " he said . for its part , the consumer protection group defended its article , saying it had given organizers five months to improve matters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2006 german government approves multi-billion investment program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cabinet ministers discuss germany 's future near berlin germany 's government of christian and social democrats has sent out a signal of industriousness by approving a 25-billion-euro -lrb- $ 30.2-billion -rrb- growth and investment package to take effect this year . the state-funded shot in the arm for the ailing german economy is meant to boost consumer confidence and create new jobs .
but the program comes at the cost of fresh borrowing and a value-added tax hike in 2007 which may nip in the bud any temporary upswing . at their two-day strategy meeting at a castle near berlin , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet ministers as well as other christian and social democrat leaders approved a 25-billion-euro spending program which they sold as just the right tool to kick-start the sluggish economy . while details on how much would be spent and on what remained undisclosed on monday , the allocated money is certain to go into research and infrastructure projects .
it 'll also be used to ensure favorable tax treatment for capital investment and housing to provide incentives particularly to the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises . private investment incentive " we 're first and foremost talking about incentives for more growth and employment , " said labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering .
" the 25 billion euros from the state will only be half of the equation with the ensuing increase in private investment being equally important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen christian democrat family minister ursula von der leyen said she is glad that part of the money will also go into more support for young families . " it 's our aim to give families with small children a better deal , " she said .
" the parents concerned are usually only at the beginning of their careers and tend to have relatively small incomes .
at the same time , they face higher costs in bringing up their kids .
so it 's only fair to offer them some sort of financial compensation . " opposition calls program " ridiculous " opposition liberal democrat leader guido westerwelle however countered that the harmony radiating from the government 's meeting is ridiculous if one looks at the expected impact of the spending program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle wanted to join merkel in a center-right coalition government " this growth and investment program is a flash in the pan , " he said .
" it 's based on fresh borrowing and wo n't have a long-term impact , because it does n't really address any of this country 's structural deficits . " opposition greens leader claudia roth does n't think much of the program , either . " it does n't strike me as very logical that the government should now lay on a massive investment program , while it 'll raise value-added tax next year with a view to getting the money back from people immediately , " she said . no other breakthroughs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late night talks did n't lead to any other decisions the government 's strategy meeting , which ends on tuesday , is not expected to result in breakthroughs in a number of other policy fields . christian and social democrat ministers said on monday that a long-term plan for the country 's energy policy and the future use of nuclear power in particular would only be adopted at a summit meeting in the spring . there wo n't be any tangible progress either towards a compromise on long overdue health service reforms . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government retreats to re-think germany 's future the german government is holding a two-day strategy meeting meant to bring both sides of the " grand coalition " into harmony .

dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany -pipe- 10.01.2006 transatlantic relations with a " series of problems " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house is set to welcome merkel to washington this week german chancellor angela merkel heads to washington on thursday for her two-day inaugural visit .
dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .

but increasingly companies are aiming to improve the bottom line along with society by using a publicity-friendly vehicle known as corporate social responsibility . if stuttgart ’ s public fountains are clean and in good repair , local metal-casting concern bornemann + haller may be the one to thank . the company is not in the fountain business , but in 2002 it " adopted " stuttgart ’ s fountains , taking responsibility for their repair and upkeep , together with the local government , as part of its “ goal-oriented company policy ” of social engagement . the move continues a long tradition of german firms taking an active role in communities , be they local or international .
in this case , a company official said the project was chosen even though " fountains are n't our business , " because the need was there and a top executive took an interest . finding a good fit while achim halfmann appreciates the corporate support for local projects , he 'd rather the random nature of it be replaced by with joint actions between business and communities that would help support various causes as well as the companies that fund them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against government cost-cutting reforms " businesses must learn to make the most of their social involvement , and see that it matches their product , their workers , their community - that it reflects what their company is about , " said halfmann , whose consulting company , public integration , ltd . , helps firms develop strategies for aiding their communities . german firms are certainly not laggards when it comes to corporate social responsibility , or csr . a recent eu study showed 54 percent of german companies took an active social role in the life of their communities , compared with an eu average of 49 percent . filling the gap but germany is still well behind european leader finland , where 83 percent of small and midsize companies are social do-gooders . " the anglo-saxon business world is far ahead of europe " when it comes to taking advantage of the opportunities csr presents , halfmann said .
" they 've been doing this for a long time . " yet csr seems poised to become even more important to the welfare of german business .
it stands to fill the gap between two conflicting trends : shrinking levels of social spending by the government and an increasing desire by shareholder to see that companies are doing something besides just looking to maximize profits . andreas gross , spokesman for the bda employers ' association , said : " csr ... has taken on a new dimension in the past two , maybe three years . ” his organization runs a web site , csrgermany.de , which lists german firms that have csr programs and the various forms they take . “ what has changed is that the public is much more aware of these issues , ” gross said , noting that germany ’ s manager magazin ran a ranking of companies ' csr activities for the first time last year . “ it is certainly relevant for companies that are listed on the stock exchange - they are more carefully watched , ” he added . bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest magazine has been helping german consumers for more than 40 years more and more , companies are realizing that investors as well as consumers are keeping a watchful eye .
germany ’ s respected consumer magazine stiftung warentest has started adding social criteria to its product ratings .
and woe to the company that gets on the wrong side of an environmental boycott , like the one that greenpeace started against shell after the oil company announced plans to sink a platform off the north sea a decade ago . ecopencils ? one example of a firm that has successfully tied its social activities to its market segment is europe ’ s biggest pencil maker , faber-castell .
more than a decade ago , the southern german firm developed a pioneering reforestation project in brazil .
the project - far from the rain forest - grows trees for its pencils while creating a sanctuary for protected species .
the company also developed environmentally friendly , water-soluble lacquers for its pencil coatings , winning kudos from the eu environment ministry .
and in 2000 , faber castell instituted a social charter that forbids child labor and supports equal opportunity and equal pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with these , consumers can jot notes with a good conscience such projects are often as much about good publicity as they are about deeply held belief , and the line between the two can be blurry . but in a 2005 study by the international consulting firm pleon , only 10 percent of companies admitted their csr activities were solely meant as pr . still , there are great gulfs in terms of credibility , said wolfgang stark , professor at the university of essen , in a recent deutschlandfunk radio interview . he called britain 's body shop a " beacon of virtue . "
the cosmetics firm is renowned for being built around socially responsible action .
but he also talked about companies that “ basically support csr projects in germany with their left hand , and support a system of exploitation in nigeria with the right .

but increasingly companies are aiming to improve the bottom line along with society by using a publicity-friendly vehicle known as corporate social responsibility . if stuttgart ’ s public fountains are clean and in good repair , local metal-casting concern bornemann + haller may be the one to thank . the company is not in the fountain business , but in 2002 it " adopted " stuttgart ’ s fountains , taking responsibility for their repair and upkeep , together with the local government , as part of its “ goal-oriented company policy ” of social engagement . the move continues a long tradition of german firms taking an active role in communities , be they local or international .
in this case , a company official said the project was chosen even though " fountains are n't our business , " because the need was there and a top executive took an interest . finding a good fit while achim halfmann appreciates the corporate support for local projects , he 'd rather the random nature of it be replaced by with joint actions between business and communities that would help support various causes as well as the companies that fund them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against government cost-cutting reforms " businesses must learn to make the most of their social involvement , and see that it matches their product , their workers , their community - that it reflects what their company is about , " said halfmann , whose consulting company , public integration , ltd . , helps firms develop strategies for aiding their communities . german firms are certainly not laggards when it comes to corporate social responsibility , or csr . a recent eu study showed 54 percent of german companies took an active social role in the life of their communities , compared with an eu average of 49 percent . filling the gap but germany is still well behind european leader finland , where 83 percent of small and midsize companies are social do-gooders . " the anglo-saxon business world is far ahead of europe " when it comes to taking advantage of the opportunities csr presents , halfmann said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany -pipe- 10.01.2006 opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 'll understand each other german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .
she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern . us president george w. bush was wrong if he thought that angela merkel would be easier to deal with than gerhard schröder .
that 's become obvious since merkel demanded that the us-run guantanamo prison camp on the island of cuba be shut down .
but it 's also clear now that she will be a reliable partner .
merkel thinks strategically , not tactically , and uses her statements to that effect . this chancellor does n't change foreign policy guidelines during town square rallies ; she does n't criticize allies during election campaign events .
instead , she first voices her concerns where it 's appropriate : in face-to-face meetings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also had clear words about alleged cia abductions during her meeting with rice in december during the berlin visit of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in december , merkel did n't leave any doubt about the fact that she considers the rule of law a priority even in the fight against terror .
that 's why the surprised reaction of the german public to her guantanamo remarks is the only astonishing thing about her statement .
bush certainly had been prepared for her words for at least four weeks . no surprises merkel 's public words are also nothing more than the reflection of a given consensus in europe .
but it 's also true that she is the first european head of government to issue clear demands on specific issues , be it the treatment of prisoners in guantanamo , the abduction of suspects or the establishing of secret cia prisons . specific criticism rather than blanket condemnation is something even george bush can deal with - especially since merkel always combines her remarks with a commitment to german-american friendship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel visited the us just prior to the war in iraq in 2003 the previous government used criticism of us actions ahead of the war in iraq to justify a general withdrawal of affection .
merkel takes a pragmatic approach instead .
specific criticism on the one hand and profound political support on the other are not mutually exclusive in her opinion .
quite to the contrary : only cooperating partners are able to resolve conflicts .
merkel is not suspected of anti-americanism and she uses the freedom to maneuver that comes with that . a critical partner her critical remarks ahead of her us visit have enabled her to widen the field even further .
she comes to washington with strong backing from the public and without any risk of capsizing .
nobody - especially merkel - expects the us government to fulfil even a single one of her demands .
she 's already getting applause just for raising the issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is gliding on a wave of public support at home bush on the other hand is facing a chancellor who will offer herself as a partner despite all the criticism .
she 's doing this from a strengthened position - strongly rooted in europe , with broad backing by her government and public support behind her . this angela merkel has much a better chance of being taken seriously in washington than her predecessor .
that 's crucial as germany has long disappeared from the top of the list of us priorities and was in danger of falling further under schröder . whether it is the united fight against terror , the cooperation with the -lrb- at best -rrb- semi-democratic russia or the nuclear row with iran - germany and europe can deal with these issues much more successfully at the us 's side rather than without or even in opposition to america . but washington expects at least political or economical - if not military - support in iraq from its partners .
knowing this , merkel has set the boundaries ahead of her visit in order to prevent the price of improved us-german relations from rising too high . uta thofern -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the united states for some of its tactics in the fight against terrorism and called for the guantanamo bay detention center to be closed in an interview published saturday .

she 's simply setting boundaries as a friend , says dw-world 's uta thofern . us president george w. bush was wrong if he thought that angela merkel would be easier to deal with than gerhard schröder .
that 's become obvious since merkel demanded that the us-run guantanamo prison camp on the island of cuba be shut down .
but it 's also clear now that she will be a reliable partner .
merkel thinks strategically , not tactically , and uses her statements to that effect . this chancellor does n't change foreign policy guidelines during town square rallies ; she does n't criticize allies during election campaign events .
instead , she first voices her concerns where it 's appropriate : in face-to-face meetings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel also had clear words about alleged cia abductions during her meeting with rice in december during the berlin visit of us secretary of state condoleezza rice in december , merkel did n't leave any doubt about the fact that she considers the rule of law a priority even in the fight against terror .
that 's why the surprised reaction of the german public to her guantanamo remarks is the only astonishing thing about her statement .
bush certainly had been prepared for her words for at least four weeks . no surprises merkel 's public words are also nothing more than the reflection of a given consensus in europe .
but it 's also true that she is the first european head of government to issue clear demands on specific issues , be it the treatment of prisoners in guantanamo , the abduction of suspects or the establishing of secret cia prisons . specific criticism rather than blanket condemnation is something even george bush can deal with - especially since merkel always combines her remarks with a commitment to german-american friendship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel visited the us just prior to the war in iraq in 2003 the previous government used criticism of us actions ahead of the war in iraq to justify a general withdrawal of affection .
merkel takes a pragmatic approach instead .
specific criticism on the one hand and profound political support on the other are not mutually exclusive in her opinion .
quite to the contrary : only cooperating partners are able to resolve conflicts .
merkel is not suspected of anti-americanism and she uses the freedom to maneuver that comes with that . a critical partner her critical remarks ahead of her us visit have enabled her to widen the field even further .

dw-radio spoke with him about the dangers of bird flu for europeans . walter haas is head of the unit for respiratory diseases and immunization at the department for infectious disease epidemiology at the robert koch institute in germany .
he is the scientific coordinator of the german working group on influenza and of the expert committee on influenza pandemic preparedness planning in germany . dw-world : bird flu has entered europe - and the threat is coming closer to germany .
how well is are people prepared for it ? walter haas : first , let me state clearly that this is still an animal disease even though there are now 14 suspected cases .
still the majority of cases are still in animals , and the vast majority result from direct contact with sick animals . is there any danger that the more people that become infected with this disease , the more easily it could mutate and spread to more people ? well , of course , there is concern that this virus might change its way of distribution and spread at one point from human to human .
so far , we have no indication that this has happened .
however , one has to be very observant to be sure that there is no change .
the vast distribution -lrb- of the disease -rrb- in more than 10 countries among animals , of course , gives the virus the chance to change and to try and adapt to other hosts including humans .
there has been criticism that the number of cases has been underestimated .
is this true ? i think the cooperation as far as our information goes between the ministry of health in turkey , the world health organization and the eu has been very good .
of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .
and , of course , a lot of people that are concerned are going to be examined and that will lead to identification of cases that might have gone undetected otherwise . we know from other bacteria that even if they are frozen or cooked , they can survive these kind of extreme conditions .
is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

dw-radio spoke with him about the dangers of bird flu for europeans . walter haas is head of the unit for respiratory diseases and immunization at the department for infectious disease epidemiology at the robert koch institute in germany .
he is the scientific coordinator of the german working group on influenza and of the expert committee on influenza pandemic preparedness planning in germany . dw-world : bird flu has entered europe - and the threat is coming closer to germany .
how well is are people prepared for it ? walter haas : first , let me state clearly that this is still an animal disease even though there are now 14 suspected cases .
still the majority of cases are still in animals , and the vast majority result from direct contact with sick animals . is there any danger that the more people that become infected with this disease , the more easily it could mutate and spread to more people ? well , of course , there is concern that this virus might change its way of distribution and spread at one point from human to human .
so far , we have no indication that this has happened .
however , one has to be very observant to be sure that there is no change .
the vast distribution -lrb- of the disease -rrb- in more than 10 countries among animals , of course , gives the virus the chance to change and to try and adapt to other hosts including humans .
there has been criticism that the number of cases has been underestimated .
is this true ? i think the cooperation as far as our information goes between the ministry of health in turkey , the world health organization and the eu has been very good .
of course , the number of cases that have been identified in the last few days result from the higher -lrb- level -rrb- of suspicion in the country .
and , of course , a lot of people that are concerned are going to be examined and that will lead to identification of cases that might have gone undetected otherwise . we know from other bacteria that even if they are frozen or cooked , they can survive these kind of extreme conditions .
is that true of this virus ? well , it has been very clearly said that if the meat is well cooked , the virus will be destroyed at the same time .
of course , while preparing food , one has to be careful and observe rules of hygiene .
this is not really a concern for european countries because there is an import -lrb- ban -rrb- from all countries where there is a suspicion of this disease . gregg benzow interviewed walter haas -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin steps up warning on poultry imports from turkey the german government on monday issued a warning against importing poultry from turkey , saying it would take the " strongest measures " against anybody breaching a european union ban .

an official decision of the latter is expected by the end of next week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are pope " was the headline in bild when german-born benedict xvi was elected springer 's media empire is currently largely focussed on the print sector , the mass-circulation bild tabloid with roughly 12 million readers being its crown jewel .
last august , springer announced that it had agreed to buy prosiebensat.1 - germany 's largest private television group - from a group of us investors . kek officials said the merger would bring together too many different media under one roof , resulting in a " dominant power of opinion " for the newly formed company . the cartel office has voiced concerns about the effects the takeover would have on the advertising market for both the television and print market .
it has given springer until thursday to come up with a new proposal . springer defends deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosiebensat.1 satellite dishes in berlin if springer holds on to bild , it is - under federal anti-monopoly rules - not allowed to own one of the main prosiebensat.1 television channels - either sat.1 or prosieben - which would devalue the worth of any deal . springer ceo matthias döpfner on tuesday meanwhile defended the proposed takeover , saying that the control bodies were overlooking global and digital shifts in the media world . he added that the company would look for other ventures outside germany if the deal is rejected . " we will take that and try our luck in the digital markets and abroad , " he said , according to the ap news service . bringing in a partner ? according to a report in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , springer is also contemplating bringing in sbs broadcasting , which owns private commercial television and radio stations in western and central europe .
sbs could then buy prosieben or sat.1 to win approval from the deal .
springer officials declined to comment on the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : springer headquarters in berlin the kek 's decision is not final , however , as springer officials can still call on germany 's state media boards , who could overturn the rejection of the deal . but jörg tauss , the media policy expert for germany 's social democrats in parliament , called on the directors of state media boards not to take such a step .
he welcomed the kek decision , saying that it guaranteed media diversity in germany . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-cartel office rejects springer 's prosieben takeover germany 's anti-cartel office has rejected an offer by newspaper publisher axel springer to buy commercial television group prosiebensat1 despite proposed concessions .

but the program comes at the cost of fresh borrowing and a value-added tax hike in 2007 which may nip in the bud any temporary upswing . at their two-day strategy meeting at a castle near berlin , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet ministers as well as other christian and social democrat leaders approved a 25-billion-euro spending program which they sold as just the right tool to kick-start the sluggish economy . while details on how much would be spent and on what remained undisclosed on monday , the allocated money is certain to go into research and infrastructure projects .
it 'll also be used to ensure favorable tax treatment for capital investment and housing to provide incentives particularly to the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises . private investment incentive " we 're first and foremost talking about incentives for more growth and employment , " said labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering .

dw-world spoke to a top german official about the expectations of the trip and merkel 's anticipated warm welcome . when german chancellor angela merkel travels to washington this week , she will be accompanied by karsten d. voigt , the foreign ministry 's coordinator for german-american cooperation .
the former foreign-policy spokesman of the social democratic party parliamentary group in the german bundestag has held this position since 1999 .
his main task is to strengthen transatlantic relations . dw-world : chancellor merkel has said she wants to strengthen germany 's ties to the united states and reduce tensions between berlin and washington that existed under former chancellor gerhard schröder .
while there are hopes that this visit could be a serious opportunity for diplomatic improvement , what sort of change can we realistically expect ? karsten d. voigt : there was , in fact , a low point in relations in the context of the iraq war .
but the relationship subsequently improved , already to the previous government .
this was evident during president bush 's visit to mainz -lrb- in february 2005 -rrb- .
now , following federal elections , these relations are to be further deepened and improved .
that is the intention of both the us and german sides .
this will certainly be evident in the protocol and in the tone taken . so will merkel 's visit be evidence more of a new tone in transatlantic relations rather than new policies by the german government ? there is a great deal of continuity in the politics .
the former german government was also in favor of strengthening europe and , at the same time , striving for good transatlantic ties .
this is also the goal of the new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karsten d. voigt has been the coordinator for german-american cooperation since 1999 but there is no question that washington is meeting angela merkel with a positive bias following the conflicts with former chancellor schröder .
it 's expected that she is pro-atlantic not only ideologically , from her convictions , but also due to her socialization in the former east germany - that she particularly values the us commitment to reunification and freedom .
this is also probably the case . do you think merkel will be able to meet peoples ' expectations in washington ? i think the white house and the state department are familiar with the situation in germany .
they know the leading politicians and political parties .
the expectations are realistic there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder and president bush did n't see eye-to-eye on the iraq war but in the public eye , especially in contrast to the excessive criticism of the previous chancellor , the expectations towards the new chancellor are perhaps larger than she herself can live up to . a series of problems remain .
the fact that germany has lesser military capabilities , for example .
it is strongly active in the balkans , in afghanistan and other parts of the world .
so even if it was politically desired , which is n't the case , it could n't deploy any relevant units of troops to iraq .
for that reason , washington will not ask this of merkel . what sort of welcome can merkel expect in washington ?
will she get the red-carpet treatment ? i think it wo n't only be the red carpet .
they will show her in every matter of protocol that she is personally welcome as chancellor and that with her , they want to improve relations and that they consider her an important representative of europe .
several people have not met her yet and so they are curious as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fall of the wall in 1989 paved the way for merkel 's career chancellor merkel is also a representative of a new generation , namely that of 1989/1990 .
these are those people who , like her , could only actively get involved in politics because the wall fell or because they reached the age to enter politics at that time .
that is the new generation of the future , which will shape german politics in the next few years . in the past , merkel has been accused of being too uncritical of the us .
yet she surprised many observers last weekend by strongly criticizing the us prison camp in guantanamo bay and said she would address the issue in her talks with bush .
it appears merkel is not going to mince words on certain topics the us administration might prefer to tone down .
should bush be ready for a dispute ? i think the term dispute is wrong .
there is simply a german consensus on guantanamo and certain other methods employed in the fight against international terrorism .
but these are legitimate discussions in democratic societies .
we had similar controversial discussions in the 1970s when we faced terrorism here in germany . what will be the main focus of merkel 's talks with bush ? i think that the entire palette of bilateral and multilateral issues will be addressed .
there will be enough time for this , both in informal talks as in the delegations .
bilaterally , we have few problems .
it is mostly a matter of how germany and the united states can work together in order to solve problems on europe 's perimeters , such as in the balkans , or how they think about russia or ukraine , how they view the middle east , and how to address iran 's ambitions to possess nuclear weapons and the scandalous statements by the iranian leadership in regard to israel . do you think us-german relations will ever return to the closeness of the past ? i think they will be - and can be - as close as in the past .
but at the same time , they will be different .
during the cold war , germany was in the center of the global conflict and totally dependent on the protection of the united states .
now , we 're happily no longer in the center of the conflict , but we are asked to contribute to the solutions of problems in other parts of the world .
at the same time , we are less dependent on the protection of the united states .
this means we have to re-define our relationship to the united states - a close relationship - but anyhow a changing one in correlation to the earlier periods of the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has had a very close relationship to the united states since world war ii will america 's reputation among the german public change if merkel manages to warm up relations between washington and berlin ? some .
the major impact is defined less by style , rather than by substance .
this is very clear in the case of some decisions by the us administration .
so far , the campaign against international terrorism is very controversial inside the united states , but it is even more controversial in europe .
you can smooth these differences by language , but in the end , you also have to define a common line in terms of substance . do you think the european public will continue to be very critical of the united states ? not of the united states , but of specific policies .
the united states have been attacked by international terrorism , and now many europeans are skeptical about the message which is used in the united states to defend that country against international terrorism . sabina casagrande interviewed karsten d. voigt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : merkel 's strategic us criticism german chancellor angela merkel 's recent criticism of guantanamo prison camp wo n't hurt us-german relations .

but the program comes at the cost of fresh borrowing and a value-added tax hike in 2007 which may nip in the bud any temporary upswing . at their two-day strategy meeting at a castle near berlin , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet ministers as well as other christian and social democrat leaders approved a 25-billion-euro spending program which they sold as just the right tool to kick-start the sluggish economy . while details on how much would be spent and on what remained undisclosed on monday , the allocated money is certain to go into research and infrastructure projects .
it 'll also be used to ensure favorable tax treatment for capital investment and housing to provide incentives particularly to the country 's small and medium-sized enterprises . private investment incentive " we 're first and foremost talking about incentives for more growth and employment , " said labor minister and vice chancellor franz müntefering .
" the 25 billion euros from the state will only be half of the equation with the ensuing increase in private investment being equally important .

" it 's based on fresh borrowing and wo n't have a long-term impact , because it does n't really address any of this country 's structural deficits . " opposition greens leader claudia roth does n't think much of the program , either . " it does n't strike me as very logical that the government should now lay on a massive investment program , while it 'll raise value-added tax next year with a view to getting the money back from people immediately , " she said . no other breakthroughs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : late night talks did n't lead to any other decisions the government 's strategy meeting , which ends on tuesday , is not expected to result in breakthroughs in a number of other policy fields . christian and social democrat ministers said on monday that a long-term plan for the country 's energy policy and the future use of nuclear power in particular would only be adopted at a summit meeting in the spring . there wo n't be any tangible progress either towards a compromise on long overdue health service reforms . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government retreats to re-think germany 's future the german government is holding a two-day strategy meeting meant to bring both sides of the " grand coalition " into harmony .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.01.2006 business poised to fill growing social gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the galatea fountains in stuttgart glisten thanks to a local company german firms have a long history of social involvement .
but increasingly companies are aiming to improve the bottom line along with society by using a publicity-friendly vehicle known as corporate social responsibility . if stuttgart ’ s public fountains are clean and in good repair , local metal-casting concern bornemann + haller may be the one to thank . the company is not in the fountain business , but in 2002 it " adopted " stuttgart ’ s fountains , taking responsibility for their repair and upkeep , together with the local government , as part of its “ goal-oriented company policy ” of social engagement . the move continues a long tradition of german firms taking an active role in communities , be they local or international .
in this case , a company official said the project was chosen even though " fountains are n't our business , " because the need was there and a top executive took an interest . finding a good fit while achim halfmann appreciates the corporate support for local projects , he 'd rather the random nature of it be replaced by with joint actions between business and communities that would help support various causes as well as the companies that fund them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters against government cost-cutting reforms " businesses must learn to make the most of their social involvement , and see that it matches their product , their workers , their community - that it reflects what their company is about , " said halfmann , whose consulting company , public integration , ltd . , helps firms develop strategies for aiding their communities . german firms are certainly not laggards when it comes to corporate social responsibility , or csr . a recent eu study showed 54 percent of german companies took an active social role in the life of their communities , compared with an eu average of 49 percent . filling the gap but germany is still well behind european leader finland , where 83 percent of small and midsize companies are social do-gooders . " the anglo-saxon business world is far ahead of europe " when it comes to taking advantage of the opportunities csr presents , halfmann said .
" they 've been doing this for a long time . " yet csr seems poised to become even more important to the welfare of german business .
it stands to fill the gap between two conflicting trends : shrinking levels of social spending by the government and an increasing desire by shareholder to see that companies are doing something besides just looking to maximize profits . andreas gross , spokesman for the bda employers ' association , said : " csr ... has taken on a new dimension in the past two , maybe three years . ” his organization runs a web site , csrgermany.de , which lists german firms that have csr programs and the various forms they take . “ what has changed is that the public is much more aware of these issues , ” gross said , noting that germany ’ s manager magazin ran a ranking of companies ' csr activities for the first time last year . “ it is certainly relevant for companies that are listed on the stock exchange - they are more carefully watched , ” he added . bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest magazine has been helping german consumers for more than 40 years more and more , companies are realizing that investors as well as consumers are keeping a watchful eye .
germany ’ s respected consumer magazine stiftung warentest has started adding social criteria to its product ratings .
and woe to the company that gets on the wrong side of an environmental boycott , like the one that greenpeace started against shell after the oil company announced plans to sink a platform off the north sea a decade ago . ecopencils ? one example of a firm that has successfully tied its social activities to its market segment is europe ’ s biggest pencil maker , faber-castell .
more than a decade ago , the southern german firm developed a pioneering reforestation project in brazil .
the project - far from the rain forest - grows trees for its pencils while creating a sanctuary for protected species .
the company also developed environmentally friendly , water-soluble lacquers for its pencil coatings , winning kudos from the eu environment ministry .
and in 2000 , faber castell instituted a social charter that forbids child labor and supports equal opportunity and equal pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with these , consumers can jot notes with a good conscience such projects are often as much about good publicity as they are about deeply held belief , and the line between the two can be blurry . but in a 2005 study by the international consulting firm pleon , only 10 percent of companies admitted their csr activities were solely meant as pr . still , there are great gulfs in terms of credibility , said wolfgang stark , professor at the university of essen , in a recent deutschlandfunk radio interview . he called britain 's body shop a " beacon of virtue . "
the cosmetics firm is renowned for being built around socially responsible action .
but he also talked about companies that “ basically support csr projects in germany with their left hand , and support a system of exploitation in nigeria with the right . " " i think we will have to live a bit longer with this ambivalence , ” he added . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .
a groundbreaking charitable foundation sheds light on the plight of female researchers and academics .

some householders complain they have been plagued by the bad behaviour of students living in the area .
they say they are fed up with noise , drunkenness and rubbish from young tenants of rented houses .
a team of community safety wardens have been appointed to work in the area and they officially began work on tuesday as students return for the new term .
the wardens aim to address anti-social behaviour and progress community development .
the scheme is one of several in the holyland area co-ordinated by the holyland inter-agency strategy group .
it brings together statutory agencies , including belfast city council , government departments , the psni and the universities and colleges . "
the wardens are acting with all the full powers of belfast city council , as well as having quick access to police and contact with the communities and universities " david farrell holyland residents ' committee the holyland is an area in south belfast close to queen 's university , where many students from there and the university of ulster live during term time .
at the beginning of the new academic year in september , queen 's appealed to new and returning students to " show respect " and allow their neighbours to live in peace .
in the previous academic year , at least four students from the university of ulster and queen 's were suspended and 45 others faced fines following complaints .
the holyland community warden scheme was officially launched by belfast lord mayor wallace browne on tuesday .
' small number ' david farrell of the holyland residents ' committee said the wardens were " a fantastic asset to the whole of south belfast " .
" it is not just the holyland - there is the potential for other areas which are just as troubled as the holyland to benefit from this type of city council initiative , " he said .
" the wardens are acting with all the full powers of belfast city council , as well as having quick access to police and contact with the communities and universities . "
he said there were only a small number of students who were " persistent trouble-makers " .
" they are the only people who have to be dealt with in a more serious way .
" the rest of the people are part of a thriving and strong community there who have been living together for many years . "
it is a pilot scheme which will initially run for one year .
the wardens will principally work at night , normally from sunday to thursday , between 2200 gmt and 0400 gmt .
colleen dowdall of the university of ulster 's students ' union said the scheme was " one of the most positive developments in the area " .

their struggle to survive was charted in a moving internet diary by their father martin .

martin , who 's a professional writer , began his blog while julie was still in hospital , as a way of keeping in touch with family and friends .
it was only later that he was asked to continue it on the action medical research website .
" it was therapeutic , " martin told us .
he continued the diary during the twins ' stay in hospital - but now they 're home , he confesses , he does n't have the free time to write much any more .
it 's now ten months since the twins should have been born - and they 're just beginning to crawl .

the french government had a simple solution for any lack of respect among the young - send in the riot police .
or at least that was the ambitious french interior minister nicholas sarkozy 's solution .
back in october last year , he announced plans to deploy hundreds of riot police in difficult neighbourhoods to crack down on crime , and offer reassurance to householders .
" do you want us to get rid of this trash ? " he asked a housewife as he toured the tower blocks of the paris suburbs , referring to youths who had been causing trouble in the area .
" some thugs act as though they own the neighbourhood .
we must change our methods , " mr sarkozy told the newspapers , saying that around 9,000 police cars had been hit with stones last year alone .
disrespectful underclass that was late october .
by the first week of november , france 's riot police had more than enough work to do in the deprived suburbs of the french cities , as youths burned cars and threw not just stones but molotov cocktails in a dramatic demonstration of discontent among french youth .
the unrest carried on for several weeks , yet the riots were confined to very specific areas - only occasionally straying into city centres .
most of the destruction was limited to the suburbs which were already run-down , and could least afford the damage , especially among the high rise blocks which are home to many of france 's ethnic minorities . "
enter a bakery or a shop or restaurant of any kind , anywhere in france without a courteous ' bonjour madame ' or ' bonjour monsieur ' to the person at the till or counter , and your reception will be a frosty one . "
the riots did lead to a growing fear in france that this country is increasingly splitting into two separate nations : the " respectful " children of the middle classes , and a growing underclass , including - though not confined to - the children and grandchildren of france 's arab and north african immigrants .
there is a feeling that there is rather less " respect " for authority than there used to be - even though some of the middle classes and french authority figures watching the riots may have been taken back to their own stone-throwing youth as members of the 1968 generation .
and yet - to this british observer - france by and large remains a positive haven of politeness and respect .
the french may be nostalgic for a mythical time when everyone knew their place , yet even these days some middle-class parisian children still call their parents by the formal address for you - " vous " .
that may be rarer now , but politeness and good manners remain essential to the french way of life , whether in the big cities or the countryside .
enter a bakery or a shop or restaurant of any kind , anywhere in france without a courteous ' bonjour madame ' or ' bonjour monsieur ' to the person at the till or counter , and your reception will be a frosty one .
but try a " comment-allez vous ? " and a " bonne journee " or " je vous en prie " and the service becomes much friendlier .
and in most schools , french pupils still sit obediently in class and teachers continue to have a certain level of authority .
respectful society that again , though , is less the case in france 's deprived suburbs , where there is a problem with gang violence , including occasional shootings and stabbings - often caused by territorial rows between gangs .
a recent " steaming " incident on a new year 's day train between nice and lyon has caused much soul-searching here , after a gang of up to 40 teenagers ran amok on the train , robbing and assaulting other passengers .
another incident on an rer paris-suburban train over the weekend - in which another gang of teenagers stole mobile phones and wallets - has led to further questions about whether france has become a more violent society , despite figures suggesting that violent incidents on public transport are actually down 11 % year on year .
in 2002 , the french education ministry launched a programme called " le respect ! " to encourage teenagers to report violence or bullying , and the ministry also issued tips to pupils on how to treat each other with increased respect .
this year , president chirac is also looking into measures which would help young people in the deprived suburbs , while calling at the same time for increased respect for law and order .
despite these exceptions , france remains overall a more courteous and respectful society - one which puts family and family values at the very heart of society .
that includes rituals such as eating a family meal together at the table , with no " grazing " or watching tv in between , and parent-child relationships that would seem rather formal to many british families , but which perhaps instil in french children a greater awareness of the boundaries of acceptable public behaviour .
it also makes french society perhaps a more traditional one , and that may be a part of its appeal to the 250,000 brits who have bought properties in france .
even in the biggest cities , there is no spectacle of friday or saturday night binge-drinking .
it is still considered shameful for men or women to be so drunk they can not stand up , or have to vomit profusely in public places .
but slowly , it seems , france may be changing - and the french are not convinced they like the way their country is going .

the creuse is one of the most rural and under-developed parts of france .
to 12-year-old simon a-poi , it must have seemed pretty grim .
he arrived in the departmental capital , gueret , in 1966 , along with more than 100 other children .
they had been taken from their homes on the island of reunion , an overseas departement of france , thousands of miles away in the indian ocean .
from the mid-1960s until 1980 , more than 1,600 children like simon a-poi were taken from their families and sent to live in orphanages or with foster parents in mainland france .
low-paid jobs the plan was simple : the problem of steady population decline in rural areas could be solved by simply transporting the population " surplus " from reunion .
the largest number ended up in the creuse .
with promises of prosperity and a brighter future , families on reunion were persuaded to sign over their children into the care of the french state .
but 40 years on , many are still in low-paid jobs , as cleaners and cooks .
some have entirely lost contact with their families back home .
now mr a-poi has formed an association with other " exiles " and is taking their case to court .
he wants the french state to admit that what it did was wrong .
" if you look in the dictionary , you will see the definition of the word ' deportation ' : to remove a population from one region and repatriate in another .
that 's the exact meaning of the word . "
he wants an apology and symbolic damages of 1 euro .
" when we got off the coach at this huge building full of little kids from reunion , my first question was : where on earth are we ? "
cold welcome simon a-poi remembers his first day in gueret .
the " huge building " was an orphanage that was to become his home for the next few years .
walking round it today , he says little has changed .
" i was placed in this room here , " he says as we come to a space about 8m by 5m , on the lower ground floor of the orphanage .
" i slept in here with four or five other little ones .
even 40 years on , i feel very emotional every time i come back here .
the memories are still strong .
i was far away from home , but at least i had other kids like me for companionship . "
madame virmoux-boisse worked at the orphanage back in the 1960s .
she remembers the day simon 's coach arrived .
" we were astonished .
when the kids arrived it was almost winter .
they were n't used to the cold , they 'd never seen snow .
some did n't know what gloves were , or long trousers .
" i saw some wearing two pairs of shorts , one over the other .
i saw one girl coming back from school in tears because she was so cold .
she did n't know what to do with her gloves . "
but the residents of the creuse were equally perplexed by the new arrivals .
local friction jean-claude simon , a gardener , says there was friction between the locals and the children from reunion .
" it was the first time we had seen children with a different skin colour , " he said .
" it was at a time towards the end of the war with algeria , and there were people who had come back from the war , or who had lost children in the war , and those people had a pretty violent reaction to the kids from reunion . "
he thought the children had been abandoned by their families back home .
when he discovered the truth , he decided to do his bit and help track down the relatives of some of the children brought over to repopulate the creuse .
despite the fact that many of the reunion children have stayed , the creuse is still one of the most under-populated parts of france .
as we walk around town , mr a-poi stops regularly to greet shopkeepers and cafe owners .
clearly he is a familiar and popular figure in the area .
after being placed with various families , and running away several times , simon a-poi finished school , married a local woman and went to work as a cook .
although he goes back regularly to reunion to see his daughter who has moved back there , his life is now in gueret .
but of one thing , he is certain : " if i could turn back the clock , i would do anything to avoid coming here in the first place . "

" when we got off the coach at this huge building full of little kids from reunion , my first question was : where on earth are we ? "
cold welcome simon a-poi remembers his first day in gueret .
the " huge building " was an orphanage that was to become his home for the next few years .
walking round it today , he says little has changed .
" i was placed in this room here , " he says as we come to a space about 8m by 5m , on the lower ground floor of the orphanage .
the reunion children were aliens in the rural french community " i slept in here with four or five other little ones .
even 40 years on , i feel very emotional every time i come back here .
the memories are still strong .
i was far away from home , but at least i had other kids like me for companionship . "
madame virmoux-boisse worked at the orphanage back in the 1960s .
she remembers the day simon 's coach arrived .
" we were astonished .
when the kids arrived it was almost winter .
they were n't used to the cold , they 'd never seen snow .
some did n't know what gloves were , or long trousers .
" i saw some wearing two pairs of shorts , one over the other .
i saw one girl coming back from school in tears because she was so cold .
she did n't know what to do with her gloves . "
but the residents of the creuse were equally perplexed by the new arrivals .
local friction jean-claude simon , a gardener , says there was friction between the locals and the children from reunion .
" it was the first time we had seen children with a different skin colour , " he said .
reunion families signed their children over to the french state " it was at a time towards the end of the war with algeria , and there were people who had come back from the war , or who had lost children in the war , and those people had a pretty violent reaction to the kids from reunion . "
he thought the children had been abandoned by their families back home .
when he discovered the truth , he decided to do his bit and help track down the relatives of some of the children brought over to repopulate the creuse .
despite the fact that many of the reunion children have stayed , the creuse is still one of the most under-populated parts of france .
as we walk around town , mr a-poi stops regularly to greet shopkeepers and cafe owners .
clearly he is a familiar and popular figure in the area .
after being placed with various families , and running away several times , simon a-poi finished school , married a local woman and went to work as a cook .
although he goes back regularly to reunion to see his daughter who has moved back there , his life is now in gueret .
but of one thing , he is certain : " if i could turn back the clock , i would do anything to avoid coming here in the first place . "

who , what , why ?
the magazine answers ...
he 's the frontrunner for the lib dem leadership , but why is sir menzies campbell 's first name pronounced mingis ?
blame the " yogh " , a letter in old english and scots -lrb- see image , right -rrb- which has no exact equivalent today .
pronounced " yog " , it used to be written a bit like the old copperplate-style " z " with a tail , which helps explain the discrepancy between the spelling of menzies and the pronunciation .
the rise of printing in the 16th century coincided with the decline of the yogh , and so it tended to be rendered in print as a " z " , and pronounced as such .
but there 's more to saying menzies than simply transposing the " z " for a " g " when speaking the name .
" you 've got the upper ' y ' sound from the back of the mouth and the ' n ' sound going to meet it , " says chris robinson , director of the scottish language dictionaries .
" there 's a sort of assimilation of the two sounds . "
who , what , why ?
a feature to the bbc news magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines according to the bbc pronunciation unit , the name can be phonetically transcribed as " ming-iss " .
" it rhymes with ' sing ' but without the hard ' g ' , " says bbc pronunciation linguist catherine sangster .
" think of the difference between ' finger ' and ' singer ' .
in menzies , you want the ' n ' to immediately form into the soft ' ng ' from singer . "
the yogh takes a softer " y " sound in the word capercaillie , the name of a large grouse , which the oxford english dictionary spells " capercailye " or " capercailzie " .
the same goes for the scottish surname dalziel , pronounced dee-ell .
the yogh owes its origin to the irish scribes who arrived in saxon britain in the 8th century and began teaching the anglo saxons to write - before this , old english was written in runes , says ms robinson .
it fell out of favour with the normans , whose scribes disliked non-latin characters and replaced it with a " y " or " g " sound , and in the middle of words with " gh " .
but the scottish retained the yogh in personal and place names , albeit mutating into a " z " to please the typesetters of the day .
inevitably , however , the euphemistic " z " became a real " z " , in some quarters at least .
the surname " mackenzie " now almost universally takes the " zee " sound although it would have originally been pronounced " mackenyie " .
" i had two girls in my class at school with the surname menzies , one pronounced ' mingis ' the other ' menzees ' , " says ms robinson .
often pronunciation can be an indicator of class and status , or geography .
but in the case of menzies it 's purely arbitrary , says ms robinson , who advises to always check .
those south of the border might be surprised to know that the newsagent chain john menzies takes the old pronunciation , and so should be john mingis .
the company 's website has a bit of fun with the potential for misunderstanding , invoking the following poem to make its point -lrb- see internet links , above right , for audio -rrb- : a lively young damsel named menzies inquired : " do you know what this thenzies ? "
her aunt , with a gasp , replied : " it 's a wasp , and you 're holding the end where the stenzies . "

regarding the letter " yogh " , can you clarify the pronunciation of yoghurt for me ?
i fear i may have got it wrong all these years .
ian , uk oh , the joys of the english language !
as a teacher of efl in spain , a country whose language is very phonetic , each letter has a sound , and it hardly ever changes , it is a constant source of fun and struggle to teach pronunciation .
pj , barcelona for mis-pronouncing silent letters , i think this is the best story i 've heard : jean harlow was at a dinner party and kept on addressing margot asquith -lrb- wife of prime minister herbert asquith -rrb- as margot -lrb- pronouncing the ' t ' -rrb- .
margot finally had enough and said to her " no jean , the t is silent , as in harlow " .
stephen buxton , coventry , uk , thelbiq.co.uk in this neck of the woods , menzies would be pronounced menzees , which is an awful lot nicer than mingis .
alison , aberdeen my late grandparents lived in a town called glenzier and for the past 22 years of my life , i have pondered why exactly it 's pronounced glinger .
thank you bbc for finally explaining the reason behind it !
phil rae , langholm i was once advised by a venerable scots lib dem many years ago that the correct pronunciation of mr campbell 's first name is ' menoz ' .
she noted that he once thanked her for being the only person in cowley street who ever said it correctly .
andy crick , oxfordshire , uk this menzies thing always made me laugh growing up .
every dundonian knows that the district known as menzieshill is pronounced " meeniss-hill " -lrb- we soften the ' e ' and drop the ' g ' for effect ! -rrb- - and yet we 'd rarely pronounce the newsagent john menzies ' correctly ' .
richard b , edinburgh -lrb- formerly dundee -rrb- , scotland , uk i knew someone called john menzies , who pronounced it " meany " .
i suppose that at least gives us a collective term for campbell 's supporters - they can all be " meanies " brian clapham , london what about those with names st. john pronounced sinjun or st. clair pronounced sinclair ?
oliver crispin , london i do n't speak old english or old scots .
neither does anybody else .
it 's pretentious upper-class twaddle .
neil hoskins , aylesbury , uk what 's the difference between " finger " and " singer " ?
they both sound the same to me !
ash , andover interesting .
i knew about the old english letter .
it 's often printed as ' g ' when books of anglo-saxon poems are printed .
so ' gingra ' for ' younger ' , where the first letter should be a ' yogh ' , sound intermediate between a y and g , i was taught .
the old word ' ye ' as in ' o come all ye faithful ' should also be spelt with it .
alan e. , west yorkshire after reading this , maybe it is time for my to hang my head and apologise to the poor mr menzies who used to buy contact lenses from the opticians i worked at a few years ago .
every three months he came in asking for his new batch of lenses -lrb- menzies pronounced with ing -rrb- , and every time i would say i could n't find them , asked him to spell his name and then say ' ah , you mean menzies -lrb- pronounced with the z -rrb- .
this went of for 2 years and kept me slightly amused as i felt i was getting one over on a snobby customer !
mike burns , inverness , scotland having lived in scotland for four years and worked in the newspaper industry with the john menzies firm -lrb- now a newspaper and magazine distributor having sold their retail chain to whsmith several years ago -rrb- , the company name was always pronounced with the ' z ' and not with the ' yogh ' described in your article .
i have been told that ' menzies ' was pronounced with a ' z ' in surnames in scotland , but in the old style in forenames .
simon linacre , west yorkshire , uk what an excellent article .
thank you for clearing up the mystery of why dalziel is pronounced dee-ell , that has puzzled me since the series first aired .
i 've always pronounced the newsagents name as john ming-iss .
dougie lawson , basingstoke , uk having the middle name of menzies -lrb- due to the scottish tradition of receiving your mother 's maiden name as your middle name -rrb- i am watching all this debate on what i thought was a fairly standard name with interest .
i used to be slightly embarrassed about my name being pronounced " mingis " but all this publicity seems to be changing that !
gillian sinclair , manchester , uk not so about john menzies the newsagents - i lived in edinburgh for 8 years where everyone pronounces it as menzees .
not only that but i worked for the ad agency there that had the john menzies account , and we recorded radio jingles that also pronounced it as menzees .
presumably that was okayed by the company ...
louise elliott , cheshire as a child i lived in one of those areas in the nw where " singer " is pronounced " sing-ger " .
so when schoolteachers tried to explain things by reference to the difference between the sounds of finger and singer , i had no idea what they were talking about .
ivan viehoff , chalfont st giles , england john menzies might think they are called john mingis , but when i was growing up in the west highlands everyone -lrb- except my mum -rrb- called them john menzees .
