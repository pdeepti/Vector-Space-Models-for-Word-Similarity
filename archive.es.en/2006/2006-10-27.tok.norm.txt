as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods . germany scrambled friday to limit the damage stemming from the publication of photographs of some of its servicemen in macabre and sometimes obscene poses with a human skull and skeleton in afghanistan . the images , one of which showed a skull next to a soldier 's exposed penis and first splashed across the mass-selling bild tabloid this week , have sparked disbelief and outrage in the country as well as fears of protests in the muslim world . german politicians have unanimously condemned the incidents and an official inquiry has already led to the suspension of two soldiers . " i 'm devastated and also worried , both about the abuse of islamic values as well as the yet unforeseeable consequences of these incidents , " said winfried nachtwei , defense policy spokesman of the opposition green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of german troops in afghanistan are involved in reconstruction work though defense experts have been at pains to point out that the incidents are isolated and that the entire 2,800-strong contingent of german peacekeepers in afghanistan should n't be tarred with the same brush , many are calling for a review of army training programs and the preparedness of german soldiers participating in overseas missions . the scandal coincides with the presentation to lawmakers this week of a new long-term national security policy , which predicts an increasingly important role for the armed forces abroad . training in cultural sensibilities " we have to ask whether the training that soldiers undergo is sufficient , " reinhold robbe , a social democrat parliamentarian and designated defense commissioner for the german parliament told broadcaster zdf . " though the soldiers are trained very well in defense tactics , we have to equip them with more intercultural sensibilities and moral values , " he said . thomas ruttig , an expert on afghanistan at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , said that military training for soldiers being sent to afghanistan did involve familiarizing them with the country 's traditions and cultural sensibilities . " soldiers usually are briefed by all kinds of experts and institutions on developing understanding and tolerance for other religions and supplied with all kinds of material and manuals on the region , " ruttig said .

in june this year , a german newspaper reported that new recruits with a paratrooper squadron in the state of rheinland-palatinate were subjected to humiliating initiation rituals including stripping naked and being slapped with paddles . " we only hear a part of these incidents when they make it out into the open , but the real problem is much bigger , " said prieß , a former lieutenant . " being a soldier changes a person .
walking around with a loaded weapon in a foreign country , far away from everything that 's familiar and bound within group dynamics , does lead to brutalization and a loss of inhibitions , " he said . on friday , the bild newspaper published an interview with a man it said belonged to the army patrol responsible for the initial photos .

at present , more than 9,000 german soldiers are deployed in peacekeeping missions around the world . " the thing with foreign deployments is that even a low-level soldier faces increased demands .
it 's a high-stress job , " said nachtwei .

as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods . germany scrambled friday to limit the damage stemming from the publication of photographs of some of its servicemen in macabre and sometimes obscene poses with a human skull and skeleton in afghanistan . the images , one of which showed a skull next to a soldier 's exposed penis and first splashed across the mass-selling bild tabloid this week , have sparked disbelief and outrage in the country as well as fears of protests in the muslim world . german politicians have unanimously condemned the incidents and an official inquiry has already led to the suspension of two soldiers .

the berlin-based deutsche oper triggered a row last month by canceling the opera " idomeneo " because of fears of islamist violence over piece 's final scene showing the severed heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus , buddha and the ancient greek god poseidon . a tragedy set in ancient crete , " idomeneo " was removed from deutsche oper 's november schedule after police warned it could pose and " incalculable " security risk and possibly spark violent reactions from muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms was resonsible for row over artistic freedom the cancellation of four scheduled performances of " idomeneo " by opera head kirsten harms in september was condemned by politicians and artists who said germans should not bow to fears of terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called the decision crazy and chancellor angela merkel warned against " self-censorship out of fear . " despite the criticism , harms refused to put the production on again without an all-clear from police . no danger in staging opera after re-evaluating the situation , berlin police on thursday issued a statement stating that " the opera and its staff currently faced no concrete danger " if performances were held .
after receiving the police 's new analysis , the deutsche oper announced on friday it had begun preparations for reviving the opera .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police thought berlin opera hosue could be at risk of terrorist attacks " those in charge of the decision over whether to stage the mozart opera ' idomeneo ' ... have decided to aim for two performances this year , " the opera house said in a statement , adding that the earliest the production could be staged was in december , though it did not mention any specific dates . berlin 's state culture minister thomas flierl welcomed the decision .
flierl had previously called for the reinstatement of the opera because " people ca n't debate it unless it is being performed . " police said they would discuss possible security measures close to the date of the new performances of " idomeneo . " the row over " idomeneo " coincided with a government-sponsored conference to promote dialogue with the several million muslims in the country and came shortly after pope benedict xvi angered muslim leaders during a visit to his home in germany by referring to a medieval text linking islam to violence .
integration has become a priority for the government as concern grows about islamic radicalization across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims , mainly turks , in germany . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de political and cultural leaders condemn opera cancellation a violent scene with images of the prophet mohammed led berlin 's german opera to take mozart 's " idomeneo " from the schedule .

the berlin-based deutsche oper triggered a row last month by canceling the opera " idomeneo " because of fears of islamist violence over piece 's final scene showing the severed heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus , buddha and the ancient greek god poseidon . a tragedy set in ancient crete , " idomeneo " was removed from deutsche oper 's november schedule after police warned it could pose and " incalculable " security risk and possibly spark violent reactions from muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms was resonsible for row over artistic freedom the cancellation of four scheduled performances of " idomeneo " by opera head kirsten harms in september was condemned by politicians and artists who said germans should not bow to fears of terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called the decision crazy and chancellor angela merkel warned against " self-censorship out of fear . " despite the criticism , harms refused to put the production on again without an all-clear from police . no danger in staging opera after re-evaluating the situation , berlin police on thursday issued a statement stating that " the opera and its staff currently faced no concrete danger " if performances were held .
after receiving the police 's new analysis , the deutsche oper announced on friday it had begun preparations for reviving the opera .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police thought berlin opera hosue could be at risk of terrorist attacks " those in charge of the decision over whether to stage the mozart opera ' idomeneo ' ... have decided to aim for two performances this year , " the opera house said in a statement , adding that the earliest the production could be staged was in december , though it did not mention any specific dates . berlin 's state culture minister thomas flierl welcomed the decision .
flierl had previously called for the reinstatement of the opera because " people ca n't debate it unless it is being performed . " police said they would discuss possible security measures close to the date of the new performances of " idomeneo . " the row over " idomeneo " coincided with a government-sponsored conference to promote dialogue with the several million muslims in the country and came shortly after pope benedict xvi angered muslim leaders during a visit to his home in germany by referring to a medieval text linking islam to violence .
integration has become a priority for the government as concern grows about islamic radicalization across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims , mainly turks , in germany . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de political and cultural leaders condemn opera cancellation a violent scene with images of the prophet mohammed led berlin 's german opera to take mozart 's " idomeneo " from the schedule .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : installed thermia heat pump the " rock " technology is adaptable - in countries with very little bedrock , like the netherlands , the tube for collecting heat is simply laid in the ground water , which also keeps a steady temperature .
the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .
according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .
and for bergsjoe , the advantages of the pump system are obvious .
" this is a very environmentally friendly heating system .. because 75 % of the energy used by heat pumps is solar energy .
so it 's clean , it 's energy efficient and very good for the environment . "
obstacles to " rock energy " the are some negatives to the heat pump , such as the relatively high initial installation cost .
the system is adapted for water-based heating systems , but many european houses rely on gas or electric heaters .
this means they would need extensive upgrading before a heat pump and rock energy technology can be installed .
this wasn ’ t a problem for nils raambin in uppsala because the apartment blocks there already had water-based heaters .
raambin can only speak well of " rock energy " .
and there was another positive side effect - the water fountain in the middle of the square comes from ground water hit during drilling . "
we dug down a water pump in the hole .
so , that 's for free too , " raambin said . lars bevanger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic heating with rocks in sweden www-links international energy association geothermal links further information about geothermal technology geothermie germany german portal on geothermal energy -lrb- in german -rrb- 9801 dw-radio live spectrum listen live dw on demand video on demand audio on demand audio / video podcasting © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the scandal meanwhile widened as a tabloid said it would publish more photos saturday . defense minister franz josef jung said that the two men " will no longer be a part of the german army . "
four others , who had also been identified as having participated in taking the photographs , have since left the bundeswehr . german private tv channel rtl on thursday night showed pictures of a soldier kissing a skull that was lying on his shoulder and of another posing with a skull mounted on his patrol vehicle .
in a third photograph , several skulls are piled on top of each to form a pyramid . rtl officials said the pictures were taken with a digital camera and dated from march 2004 , making them roughly a year younger than the photographs of soldiers and skulls published in germany 's bild tabloid on wednesday .
they show soldiers posing with a skull mounted on a patrol vehicle bearing the german flag and the acronym isaf .
in one picture , a soldier in a camouflage uniform holds the skull next to his exposed penis . bild editors said they would publish further images saturday .
the images reportedly show a mock execution of a skeleton assembled from various human remains . the chief of staff of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , denied suggestions that the fact that a second set of pictures has come to light proved that such behavior was widespread among german troops . " it is another isolated case , " schneiderhan told rtl , but vowed that the soldiers involved would face a " merciless " inquiry .
state prosecutors have said they could face charges of disturbing the peace of the dead , which carries a prison sentence of up to three years . cemetery or pit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in afghanistan the bundeswehr said it appeared that the soldiers had found the skulls in a cemetery south of kabul .
but in an interview with bild , one of the soldiers involved in the incident said that soldiers found the bones during a patrol near a pit outside kabul . " it was where the afghans dug up the clay they needed to make bricks , " the unidentified soldier said .
" all these bones came out in the process .
it was not a cemetery , not a place of worship . " he said he was not forced to participate , but that people who refused to do so would have been called " wimps . " low inhibition threshold the man said that he should not have participated in the incident , but added that he and his comrades were tense at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an isaf ambulance near a place where german soldiers were killed in 2003 " it 's hard on the nerves when you 're constantly confronted with people from your own army or the allies getting hurt or die , " he said .
" i think that the inhibition threshold was low because of this . according to news reports , the location was well-known among soldiers stationed in afghanistan , who repeatedly came there to take photographs .
german opposition green party politician hans-christian ströbele said he had been told by at least half-a-dozen soldiers that there were hundreds of such photos in existence . german politicians and military officials have meanwhile called for a review of the bundeswehr 's training program to make sure that soldiers are well prepared for their missions . defense minister jung said a team of specialists would be traveling to afghanistan to assess conditions there .
he added that the bundeswehr would also review its training methods . afghan government condemns actions the afghan government meanwhile on friday " strongly condemned " friday the actions of german soldiers seen in photographs playing with human skulls in afghanistan and said their acts were against islamic values . the government called on " german authorities to investigate the matter , bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure such actions are not repeated , " the statement said . there has been little attention to the scandal in the afghan media , with most newspapers suspending publication over the eid holidays . insults to islam have sparked fierce reaction in conservative afghanistan .
an incident in which us soldiers in islamic afghanistan were captured on film burning the bodies of men said to be taliban fighters late last year caused outrage as it was disrespectful of the dead and against the tenets of islam . last year , the publication of danish cartoons deemed insulting of the prophet mohammad caused days of rioting across the country that left 11 people dead . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghan government " deeply saddened " by soldier scandal kabul has condemned photos published of german soldiers posing with a skull as being " against islamic values .

the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy proposed that a common immigration policy should be created for the european union at an informal meeting thursday in stratford-upon-avon , england .
the proposal aims to create an eu asylum authority and open up the eu 's labor market to temporary guest workers . under the proposal , workers from poor countries could live in eu countries for three to four years , transfer money to their home countries and return with newly acquired skills , schäuble said . the idea of such " circular migration " originates with the united nations and aims to combine migration with development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plan aims to curb illegal migration to the eu at the end of last year , a report by the global commission on international migration found the number of migrants around the world had risen to 200 million .
the report counted people who lived in a foreign country for more than one year and included 9.2 million refugees .
in 1972 , the number of migrants worldwide was 82 million . the report estimated that migrants sent $ 150 billion -lrb- 118 billion euros -rrb- to their families in their home countries in 2004 and that in many countries , without foreign workers , entire economic sectors would collapse . eu adoption british , italian and spanish polish interior ministers approved the proposal , which would have to be expanded and streamlined with a view to being adopted by the eu council of ministers at the eu summit in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu immigration control schäuble and sarkozy had also proposed that national immigration quotas be registered with brussels , which would enable the eu to repatriate illegal immigrants to their countries of origin more easily . " there are voices around this table from the right and from the left who are united in seeing the subject of immigration not as a thing of politics but of human drama , " sarkozy said . german skepticism german politicians , however , expressed skepticism about the " circular migration " idea .
the internal affairs spokesperson for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , dieter wiefelspütz , told the berliner zeitung daily that current rules were sufficient . " i ca n't see any need for temporary guest workers , " he said , referring to germany 's 4 million unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has seen an increase in illegal immigrants from sub-saharan africa the spokesperson for migration issues from the free-market liberal fdp party , sibylle laurischk , called the suggestion " naïve . " " evidently , they 've forgotten the lessons from the 1960 's , " she told the paper , referring to a period then germany brought many turkish guest workers into the country .
many of them stayed despite the government 's intention that they would return home after several years of work . the interior ministers of britain , germany , france , spain , italy and poland were taking part in the two-day meeting , which began wednesday with discussions on a joint policy to combat terrorism .
this so-called g6 was set up by britain and france in 2003 to provide an informal way for big eu countries to discuss issues of law and order and immigration . interior ministers also pledged to share more information about future terrorist threats and to fight eu value-added-tax fraud . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g6 ministers debate terrorism behind closed doors key european union ministers met in england on wednesday for talks on terrorism , illegal immigration and organized crime that critics fear will set an eu-wide security policy in virtual secrecy .

but it did n't used to be that way .
for a long time , it was heavily polluted . people used to gravitate toward the rhine river for all sorts of play - even swimming despite the dangerous currents .
legend has it that in winter , part of the rhine used to freeze over , and people would walk across the mighty waterway . the river begins in switzerland .
passing through the city of basel , it forms the border between germany and france , flows into germany and the netherlands and ends in the north sea . but in the wake of an environmental disaster 20 years ago in switzerland , many stayed away from the water , with experts wondering if it would ever be clean again .
at a recent press conference , an international commission said the rhine is a " living " river once more . polluted with pesticides in 1986 , a fire broke out in a production plant storage room at the pharmaceutical company sandoz in the swiss city of basel .
as a result , huge amounts of pesticides were released into the upper rhine , killing a multitude of fish and micro-organisms . the accident turned the river into europe 's biggest sewer . fritz holzwarth , head of the bonn-based international commission for the protection of the rhine , said that it was this catastrophe that triggered concern about the river 's health . " we can say that the sandoz incident was basically the worst possible scenario at the time so it contributed a great deal to making the protection of water an important issue in politics , " he said . a huge task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairy-tale beauty along the waterway 's twists and turns it would take a lot of effort before the river could be transformed into a place where people could swim again .
ultimately , it was pressure from an outraged public that forced politicians to take fast action . since then , investments in industrial and public water purification plants have amounted to 60 billion euros -lrb- over $ 75 billion -rrb- , with local governments investing a yearly amount of one billion euros in water purification . the risk of another dramatic accident has been minimized since the companies located along the rhine have taken precautions , holzwarth said , adding that a pro-active approach is necessary to keep the river clean . " the international commission for the protection of the rhine , together with those who live near the river 's banks , want to advance a perspective that allows people to live with and enjoy the river , " he said .
" we want to include the river in our lives and in those of our children , " he added . to that end , a 320-kilometer-long -lrb- nearly 200-mile -rrb- hiking trail called the rheinsteig was recently completed between bonn and koblenz . in addition , the rhine , europe 's most densely populated river , is a unesco world heritage site .

dw-world.de talked to henrik uterwedde about reactions of the french government and the continuing social gap . henrik uterwedde is deputy director of the franco-german institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern german .
he teaches political science at stuttgart university . dw-world.de : friday is the one-year anniversary of the riots in the french suburbs .
cars were again set on fire in the last couple of days .
the police secret service warns about an escalation . henrik uterwedde : there were repeated clashes , including incidents , where police officers , who wanted to check people , were ambushed by teenaged gangs .
moral barriers against readiness for violence have been torn down .
and it 's hard to erect them again . are these assaults the first signs of a new wave of violence ? at least you can not rule that out .
there are signs that the climate in the suburbs remains explosive .
experts , such as one of the mayors in the area , say : " we 're sitting on a powder keg . "
that 's because the roots of the crisis have not been eradicated .
you can not do away with 30 years of crisis-like developments within 12 months . what are the causes for the teenagers ' frustration ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their future 's not looking too bright so far first of all , it 's a deep social crisis .
about 700 hot spot quarters exist in france 's metropolitan areas and almost 5 million people live there .
these areas are monocultures .
forty percent of youngsters who live there do n't have a high school diploma .
the unemployment rate is twice as high as in the rest of france .
there 's a conglomeration of all social problems the country is facing .
on top of that , you have an integration crisis .
teenagers from immigrant families are especially discriminated against when they 're looking for work .
it 's not enough to criminalize teenagers and employ a law and order policy to restore peace - as interior minister sarkozy has been doing in a very populist way . the government has announced several initiatives following the riots last year .
which political steps have been taken ? even before 2005 , useful programs existed that tried to diffuse hot spots of social conflict .
following the riots , there were four measures .
people tried to improve the chances of employment for the teenagers in metropolitan areas .
steps have been taken to combat ethnic discrimination .
another , very expensive , program is that of urban planning .
there 's a tremendous problem with the clusters of apartment towers .
a renovation project has been set up .
the fourth step deal with repression .
of course the state can not tolerate the creation of lawless areas .
but all of these measures will not lead to swift successes . do you think these are steps in the right direction ? yes , i think so .
the most visible results are the ones resulting from the renovation of living space .
all other initiatives will take longer .
employment , of course , is dependent on the economy , which is not doing that great at the moment .
failure in school is another big problem .
we know that the chances to find employment rise with success in school .
but a few extra teachers wo n't be enough to fight this problem . what 's happening to address the issue of discrimination against teenagers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik uterwedde you can outlaw discrimination .
but try to change the mentality of a small business owner , who has reservations about immigrants .
there are some cases of positive discrimination .
one of the biggest elite universities , the sciences po , the institute for political science in paris , has made a kind of contract with some selected high schools in hot spot areas .
it allows a certain contingent of students from these areas to study at the university . the police union has warned that the violence is starting to take on islamist undertones ... judging by last year 's riots , you can not say that .
quite to the contrary , there were some representatives of muslim communities that became important contact people for the mayors because they were the only ones left that still had some influence over the teenagers .
in a powder keg , you can not rule out such a development .
but i do n't see this as a danger right now . ercin özlü interviewed henrik uterwedde -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new french film highlights roots of bias against north africans a recently released french film has sparked renewed debate over discrimination against north africans - and may have prompted president jacques chirac to redress an egregious imbalance .

the scandal meanwhile widened as a tabloid said it would publish more photos saturday . defense minister franz josef jung said that the two men " will no longer be a part of the german army . "
four others , who had also been identified as having participated in taking the photographs , have since left the bundeswehr . german private tv channel rtl on thursday night showed pictures of a soldier kissing a skull that was lying on his shoulder and of another posing with a skull mounted on his patrol vehicle .
in a third photograph , several skulls are piled on top of each to form a pyramid . rtl officials said the pictures were taken with a digital camera and dated from march 2004 , making them roughly a year younger than the photographs of soldiers and skulls published in germany 's bild tabloid on wednesday .
they show soldiers posing with a skull mounted on a patrol vehicle bearing the german flag and the acronym isaf .
in one picture , a soldier in a camouflage uniform holds the skull next to his exposed penis . bild editors said they would publish further images saturday .
the images reportedly show a mock execution of a skeleton assembled from various human remains . the chief of staff of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , denied suggestions that the fact that a second set of pictures has come to light proved that such behavior was widespread among german troops . " it is another isolated case , " schneiderhan told rtl , but vowed that the soldiers involved would face a " merciless " inquiry .
state prosecutors have said they could face charges of disturbing the peace of the dead , which carries a prison sentence of up to three years . cemetery or pit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in afghanistan the bundeswehr said it appeared that the soldiers had found the skulls in a cemetery south of kabul .
but in an interview with bild , one of the soldiers involved in the incident said that soldiers found the bones during a patrol near a pit outside kabul . " it was where the afghans dug up the clay they needed to make bricks , " the unidentified soldier said .
" all these bones came out in the process .
it was not a cemetery , not a place of worship . " he said he was not forced to participate , but that people who refused to do so would have been called " wimps . " low inhibition threshold the man said that he should not have participated in the incident , but added that he and his comrades were tense at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an isaf ambulance near a place where german soldiers were killed in 2003 " it 's hard on the nerves when you 're constantly confronted with people from your own army or the allies getting hurt or die , " he said .
" i think that the inhibition threshold was low because of this . according to news reports , the location was well-known among soldiers stationed in afghanistan , who repeatedly came there to take photographs .
german opposition green party politician hans-christian ströbele said he had been told by at least half-a-dozen soldiers that there were hundreds of such photos in existence . german politicians and military officials have meanwhile called for a review of the bundeswehr 's training program to make sure that soldiers are well prepared for their missions . defense minister jung said a team of specialists would be traveling to afghanistan to assess conditions there .
he added that the bundeswehr would also review its training methods . afghan government condemns actions the afghan government meanwhile on friday " strongly condemned " friday the actions of german soldiers seen in photographs playing with human skulls in afghanistan and said their acts were against islamic values . the government called on " german authorities to investigate the matter , bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure such actions are not repeated , " the statement said . there has been little attention to the scandal in the afghan media , with most newspapers suspending publication over the eid holidays . insults to islam have sparked fierce reaction in conservative afghanistan .
an incident in which us soldiers in islamic afghanistan were captured on film burning the bodies of men said to be taliban fighters late last year caused outrage as it was disrespectful of the dead and against the tenets of islam . last year , the publication of danish cartoons deemed insulting of the prophet mohammad caused days of rioting across the country that left 11 people dead . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghan government " deeply saddened " by soldier scandal kabul has condemned photos published of german soldiers posing with a skull as being " against islamic values .

in a third photograph , several skulls are piled on top of each to form a pyramid . rtl officials said the pictures were taken with a digital camera and dated from march 2004 , making them roughly a year younger than the photographs of soldiers and skulls published in germany 's bild tabloid on wednesday .
they show soldiers posing with a skull mounted on a patrol vehicle bearing the german flag and the acronym isaf .

but the subtext of the meetings is the future of eu-ukrainian relations after a pro-russian prime minister took over in september . there is always plenty to talk about when a former soviet satellite state knocks on the eu 's door .
this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
both sides want to reassure eu member states there will be no repeat of last year 's fiasco , when a russia-ukraine showdown over gas prices threatened supplies that transit through the ukraine to eu countries .
it reminded europeans of their russian energy dependence , some 80 percent of russian gas supplies to europe pass through the ukraine .
a deal made between ukraine and russia on tuesday secured supplies through 2007 , guaranteeing ukraine cheap fuel at almost half the market rates in exchange for closer cooperation between the two countries on foreign policy , particularly ukrainian aspirations to join the world trade organization and nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko wants to look west , not east " i would say quite openly that we need to synchronize the negotiation process of our countries regarding wto , " russian prime minister mikhail fradkov said after announcing the deal .
pro-russia stance paying off these days a new chapter has begun in eu-ukrainian relations as well as in russian-ukrainian relations .
pro-russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych again became prime minister in august after chaotic elections earlier this year and has worked to improve relations with its large neighbor .
in some ways , this has paid off for the ukraine and the eu so far - yanukovych was always the favored candidate of russia , especially during the 2004 elections that ushered in his opponent yushchenko and the so-called orange revolution .
it was yushchenko 's pro-eu stance that many say led russia to punish the ukraine - and its heavily energy intensive steel and chemical industries - by trying to double energy prices in january .
" ukraine is in a difficult situation as they must constantly maneuver between the west and russia , " said alexander rahr , an expert on russia and the former soviet states at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations .
" and they are particularly dependent on russia , even if they do n't like it . "
looking for a " beacon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strife within the ruling party helped the pro-russian faction that dependence is putting a damper on yushchenko 's eu aspirations .
in advance of the summit , the pro-western president said he wants the eu to be a " beacon " for the ukraine .
" a ship must always know what its destination harbor is , " yushchenko told finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat .
" the same holds true for our strivings for europe .
we would like to see the shine , the light that shows our country and our people what the destination is .
" please note that we are not asking when , " he added .
" we are only talking about the aim , the goal that should stay more or less in place .
everything else is the responsibility of my people and my country . "
hat in hand although he has not asked for formal talks on eu or nato accession , the president is not coming to finland without requests .
one is that the eu set up a free trade zone with kiev - the bloc is ukraine 's largest trade partner with exports valued at 7.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
travel is another of the issues on the ukrainian president 's card .
ukraine wants a simplified process for visas issued to its citizens and in some cases a waiver of fees , an initiative preliminarily agreed to this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once cozy relations with russia are warming again the main subtext of the summit , however , is the future of eu-ukraine relations .
the eu lent strong support to yushchenko and the orange revolution in 2004 , but since then , the country 's orientation has become more uncertain as the government split , with only yushchenko and the foreign and defense ministers appointed by him looking to the west .
most of the rest of the government - and the majority of ukrainians who still back yanukovych - do not .
the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .
" yanukovych is better able to negotiate with russia and takes a more pragmatic approach , something badly needed .

but the subtext of the meetings is the future of eu-ukrainian relations after a pro-russian prime minister took over in september . there is always plenty to talk about when a former soviet satellite state knocks on the eu 's door .
this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
both sides want to reassure eu member states there will be no repeat of last year 's fiasco , when a russia-ukraine showdown over gas prices threatened supplies that transit through the ukraine to eu countries .
it reminded europeans of their russian energy dependence , some 80 percent of russian gas supplies to europe pass through the ukraine .
a deal made between ukraine and russia on tuesday secured supplies through 2007 , guaranteeing ukraine cheap fuel at almost half the market rates in exchange for closer cooperation between the two countries on foreign policy , particularly ukrainian aspirations to join the world trade organization and nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko wants to look west , not east " i would say quite openly that we need to synchronize the negotiation process of our countries regarding wto , " russian prime minister mikhail fradkov said after announcing the deal .
pro-russia stance paying off these days a new chapter has begun in eu-ukrainian relations as well as in russian-ukrainian relations .
pro-russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych again became prime minister in august after chaotic elections earlier this year and has worked to improve relations with its large neighbor .
in some ways , this has paid off for the ukraine and the eu so far - yanukovych was always the favored candidate of russia , especially during the 2004 elections that ushered in his opponent yushchenko and the so-called orange revolution .
it was yushchenko 's pro-eu stance that many say led russia to punish the ukraine - and its heavily energy intensive steel and chemical industries - by trying to double energy prices in january .
" ukraine is in a difficult situation as they must constantly maneuver between the west and russia , " said alexander rahr , an expert on russia and the former soviet states at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations .
" and they are particularly dependent on russia , even if they do n't like it . "
looking for a " beacon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strife within the ruling party helped the pro-russian faction that dependence is putting a damper on yushchenko 's eu aspirations .
in advance of the summit , the pro-western president said he wants the eu to be a " beacon " for the ukraine .
" a ship must always know what its destination harbor is , " yushchenko told finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat .
" the same holds true for our strivings for europe .
we would like to see the shine , the light that shows our country and our people what the destination is .
" please note that we are not asking when , " he added .
" we are only talking about the aim , the goal that should stay more or less in place .
everything else is the responsibility of my people and my country . "
hat in hand although he has not asked for formal talks on eu or nato accession , the president is not coming to finland without requests .
one is that the eu set up a free trade zone with kiev - the bloc is ukraine 's largest trade partner with exports valued at 7.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
travel is another of the issues on the ukrainian president 's card .
ukraine wants a simplified process for visas issued to its citizens and in some cases a waiver of fees , an initiative preliminarily agreed to this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once cozy relations with russia are warming again the main subtext of the summit , however , is the future of eu-ukraine relations .
the eu lent strong support to yushchenko and the orange revolution in 2004 , but since then , the country 's orientation has become more uncertain as the government split , with only yushchenko and the foreign and defense ministers appointed by him looking to the west .
most of the rest of the government - and the majority of ukrainians who still back yanukovych - do not .
the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .
" yanukovych is better able to negotiate with russia and takes a more pragmatic approach , something badly needed .
and since he enjoys such support at home , maybe he can achieve more regarding the internal situation of the country .

the berlin-based deutsche oper triggered a row last month by canceling the opera " idomeneo " because of fears of islamist violence over piece 's final scene showing the severed heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus , buddha and the ancient greek god poseidon . a tragedy set in ancient crete , " idomeneo " was removed from deutsche oper 's november schedule after police warned it could pose and " incalculable " security risk and possibly spark violent reactions from muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms was resonsible for row over artistic freedom the cancellation of four scheduled performances of " idomeneo " by opera head kirsten harms in september was condemned by politicians and artists who said germans should not bow to fears of terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called the decision crazy and chancellor angela merkel warned against " self-censorship out of fear . " despite the criticism , harms refused to put the production on again without an all-clear from police . no danger in staging opera after re-evaluating the situation , berlin police on thursday issued a statement stating that " the opera and its staff currently faced no concrete danger " if performances were held .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 what 's the next step for eu-ukraine relations ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy issues loom large over the summit at an eu-ukraine summit friday , eu officials will discuss trade , visas and energy .
but the subtext of the meetings is the future of eu-ukrainian relations after a pro-russian prime minister took over in september . there is always plenty to talk about when a former soviet satellite state knocks on the eu 's door .
this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
both sides want to reassure eu member states there will be no repeat of last year 's fiasco , when a russia-ukraine showdown over gas prices threatened supplies that transit through the ukraine to eu countries .
it reminded europeans of their russian energy dependence , some 80 percent of russian gas supplies to europe pass through the ukraine .
a deal made between ukraine and russia on tuesday secured supplies through 2007 , guaranteeing ukraine cheap fuel at almost half the market rates in exchange for closer cooperation between the two countries on foreign policy , particularly ukrainian aspirations to join the world trade organization and nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko wants to look west , not east " i would say quite openly that we need to synchronize the negotiation process of our countries regarding wto , " russian prime minister mikhail fradkov said after announcing the deal .
pro-russia stance paying off these days a new chapter has begun in eu-ukrainian relations as well as in russian-ukrainian relations .
pro-russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych again became prime minister in august after chaotic elections earlier this year and has worked to improve relations with its large neighbor .
in some ways , this has paid off for the ukraine and the eu so far - yanukovych was always the favored candidate of russia , especially during the 2004 elections that ushered in his opponent yushchenko and the so-called orange revolution .
it was yushchenko 's pro-eu stance that many say led russia to punish the ukraine - and its heavily energy intensive steel and chemical industries - by trying to double energy prices in january .
" ukraine is in a difficult situation as they must constantly maneuver between the west and russia , " said alexander rahr , an expert on russia and the former soviet states at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations .
" and they are particularly dependent on russia , even if they do n't like it . "
looking for a " beacon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strife within the ruling party helped the pro-russian faction that dependence is putting a damper on yushchenko 's eu aspirations .
in advance of the summit , the pro-western president said he wants the eu to be a " beacon " for the ukraine .
" a ship must always know what its destination harbor is , " yushchenko told finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat .
" the same holds true for our strivings for europe .

" please note that we are not asking when , " he added .
" we are only talking about the aim , the goal that should stay more or less in place .
everything else is the responsibility of my people and my country . "
hat in hand although he has not asked for formal talks on eu or nato accession , the president is not coming to finland without requests .
one is that the eu set up a free trade zone with kiev - the bloc is ukraine 's largest trade partner with exports valued at 7.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
travel is another of the issues on the ukrainian president 's card .
ukraine wants a simplified process for visas issued to its citizens and in some cases a waiver of fees , an initiative preliminarily agreed to this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once cozy relations with russia are warming again the main subtext of the summit , however , is the future of eu-ukraine relations .
the eu lent strong support to yushchenko and the orange revolution in 2004 , but since then , the country 's orientation has become more uncertain as the government split , with only yushchenko and the foreign and defense ministers appointed by him looking to the west .
most of the rest of the government - and the majority of ukrainians who still back yanukovych - do not .
the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .
" yanukovych is better able to negotiate with russia and takes a more pragmatic approach , something badly needed .
and since he enjoys such support at home , maybe he can achieve more regarding the internal situation of the country .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : installed thermia heat pump the " rock " technology is adaptable - in countries with very little bedrock , like the netherlands , the tube for collecting heat is simply laid in the ground water , which also keeps a steady temperature .
the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .
according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .
and for bergsjoe , the advantages of the pump system are obvious .
" this is a very environmentally friendly heating system .. because 75 % of the energy used by heat pumps is solar energy .
so it 's clean , it 's energy efficient and very good for the environment . "
obstacles to " rock energy " the are some negatives to the heat pump , such as the relatively high initial installation cost .
the system is adapted for water-based heating systems , but many european houses rely on gas or electric heaters .
this means they would need extensive upgrading before a heat pump and rock energy technology can be installed .
this wasn ’ t a problem for nils raambin in uppsala because the apartment blocks there already had water-based heaters .
raambin can only speak well of " rock energy " .
and there was another positive side effect - the water fountain in the middle of the square comes from ground water hit during drilling . "
we dug down a water pump in the hole .
so , that 's for free too , " raambin said . lars bevanger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic heating with rocks in sweden www-links international energy association geothermal links further information about geothermal technology geothermie germany german portal on geothermal energy -lrb- in german -rrb- 9801 dw-tv europe live euromaxx - leben und kultur in europa we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : installed thermia heat pump the " rock " technology is adaptable - in countries with very little bedrock , like the netherlands , the tube for collecting heat is simply laid in the ground water , which also keeps a steady temperature .
the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .
according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .
and for bergsjoe , the advantages of the pump system are obvious .

the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy proposed that a common immigration policy should be created for the european union at an informal meeting thursday in stratford-upon-avon , england .
the proposal aims to create an eu asylum authority and open up the eu 's labor market to temporary guest workers . under the proposal , workers from poor countries could live in eu countries for three to four years , transfer money to their home countries and return with newly acquired skills , schäuble said . the idea of such " circular migration " originates with the united nations and aims to combine migration with development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plan aims to curb illegal migration to the eu at the end of last year , a report by the global commission on international migration found the number of migrants around the world had risen to 200 million .
the report counted people who lived in a foreign country for more than one year and included 9.2 million refugees .
in 1972 , the number of migrants worldwide was 82 million . the report estimated that migrants sent $ 150 billion -lrb- 118 billion euros -rrb- to their families in their home countries in 2004 and that in many countries , without foreign workers , entire economic sectors would collapse . eu adoption british , italian and spanish polish interior ministers approved the proposal , which would have to be expanded and streamlined with a view to being adopted by the eu council of ministers at the eu summit in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu immigration control schäuble and sarkozy had also proposed that national immigration quotas be registered with brussels , which would enable the eu to repatriate illegal immigrants to their countries of origin more easily . " there are voices around this table from the right and from the left who are united in seeing the subject of immigration not as a thing of politics but of human drama , " sarkozy said . german skepticism german politicians , however , expressed skepticism about the " circular migration " idea .
the internal affairs spokesperson for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , dieter wiefelspütz , told the berliner zeitung daily that current rules were sufficient . " i ca n't see any need for temporary guest workers , " he said , referring to germany 's 4 million unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has seen an increase in illegal immigrants from sub-saharan africa the spokesperson for migration issues from the free-market liberal fdp party , sibylle laurischk , called the suggestion " naïve . " " evidently , they 've forgotten the lessons from the 1960 's , " she told the paper , referring to a period then germany brought many turkish guest workers into the country .
many of them stayed despite the government 's intention that they would return home after several years of work . the interior ministers of britain , germany , france , spain , italy and poland were taking part in the two-day meeting , which began wednesday with discussions on a joint policy to combat terrorism .
this so-called g6 was set up by britain and france in 2003 to provide an informal way for big eu countries to discuss issues of law and order and immigration . interior ministers also pledged to share more information about future terrorist threats and to fight eu value-added-tax fraud . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g6 ministers debate terrorism behind closed doors key european union ministers met in england on wednesday for talks on terrorism , illegal immigration and organized crime that critics fear will set an eu-wide security policy in virtual secrecy .

the man himself spoke up friday and revealed that he was in informal talks with the us soccer federation . will he or wo n't he ?
that 's the question that is looking closer to being answered friday regarding the employment status of former germany national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann . ever since the tear-stained departure of the man known and loved as " klinsi " from the germany set-up , a nation 's thanks ringing in his ears and some carefully removed knives from his back returned to their rightful owners , rumors have been circulating that klinsmann could take over the us national team . these rumors , buffeted by counter-speculation that klinsi was considering the slightly more spicy allure of mexico a little further south of his california home , have gained some credibility after reports revealed that the former stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham striker is in informal talks with the us soccer federation -lrb- ussf -rrb- . casual and relaxed discussions words from the man himself about the meeting with ussf president sunil gulati hint at a possible deal in the making : " we 've had a couple of conversations .
i 'm evaluating everything that comes up , " said klinsmann in an interview with the associated press .
" i 'll stay in touch with sunil and see what it leads to .
it 's a very casual and relaxed correspondence . " " sooner or later , i have to get back into coaching , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann left a nation in rapture gulati , who has refused to comment on his talks with any potential replacement , repeated on thursday that he hopes to have a new coach in place by the end of the year . klinsmann resigned as germany coach three days after the world cup after leading germany to the semi-finals where they lost to eventual winners italy .
his german team kept the party going for one more game by beating portugal in the third place play-off before klinsi announced that he wanted to spend more time with his family in los angeles . us lifestyle a problem for dfb , not so for suitors klinsi clashed on a number of occasions with the hierarchy at the germany football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- over his refusal to move back to the country of his birth before the world cup .
instead , klinsmann chose to commute , stirring anger in many traditionalists in the game . such a problem would not exist if he were to take up the role as successor to incumbent us coach bruce arena , who was told by gulati in mid-july that his contract would not be renewed . klinsmann remains the preferred candidate of the ussf and is the favorite of many to take over when arena leaves the post at the end of the year .
klinsmann introduced a number of stateside training and management techniques to the german set-up , prompting much criticism before the tournament . coaching techniques suited for us style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and jogi laid the foundations of a bright future a sports psychologist was employed , the team 's second kit was changed to the more positive color red and a number of non-sport related exercises were adopted to build concentration and togetherness .
discredited as new age hokum at the time , klinsi 's detractors were forced to eat large dollops of humble pie throughout june and july as his germany team rolled on . his techniques are now being utilized and advanced by his former assistant joachim löw , who now runs the team and ensures germany continues to build on the talented pool of youth at its disposal . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann hints at return for next world cup germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .

but the subtext of the meetings is the future of eu-ukrainian relations after a pro-russian prime minister took over in september . there is always plenty to talk about when a former soviet satellite state knocks on the eu 's door .
this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
both sides want to reassure eu member states there will be no repeat of last year 's fiasco , when a russia-ukraine showdown over gas prices threatened supplies that transit through the ukraine to eu countries .
it reminded europeans of their russian energy dependence , some 80 percent of russian gas supplies to europe pass through the ukraine .
a deal made between ukraine and russia on tuesday secured supplies through 2007 , guaranteeing ukraine cheap fuel at almost half the market rates in exchange for closer cooperation between the two countries on foreign policy , particularly ukrainian aspirations to join the world trade organization and nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko wants to look west , not east " i would say quite openly that we need to synchronize the negotiation process of our countries regarding wto , " russian prime minister mikhail fradkov said after announcing the deal .
pro-russia stance paying off these days a new chapter has begun in eu-ukrainian relations as well as in russian-ukrainian relations .
pro-russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych again became prime minister in august after chaotic elections earlier this year and has worked to improve relations with its large neighbor .
in some ways , this has paid off for the ukraine and the eu so far - yanukovych was always the favored candidate of russia , especially during the 2004 elections that ushered in his opponent yushchenko and the so-called orange revolution .
it was yushchenko 's pro-eu stance that many say led russia to punish the ukraine - and its heavily energy intensive steel and chemical industries - by trying to double energy prices in january .
" ukraine is in a difficult situation as they must constantly maneuver between the west and russia , " said alexander rahr , an expert on russia and the former soviet states at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations .
" and they are particularly dependent on russia , even if they do n't like it . "
looking for a " beacon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strife within the ruling party helped the pro-russian faction that dependence is putting a damper on yushchenko 's eu aspirations .
in advance of the summit , the pro-western president said he wants the eu to be a " beacon " for the ukraine .
" a ship must always know what its destination harbor is , " yushchenko told finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat .
" the same holds true for our strivings for europe .
we would like to see the shine , the light that shows our country and our people what the destination is .
" please note that we are not asking when , " he added .
" we are only talking about the aim , the goal that should stay more or less in place .
everything else is the responsibility of my people and my country . "
hat in hand although he has not asked for formal talks on eu or nato accession , the president is not coming to finland without requests .
one is that the eu set up a free trade zone with kiev - the bloc is ukraine 's largest trade partner with exports valued at 7.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
travel is another of the issues on the ukrainian president 's card .
ukraine wants a simplified process for visas issued to its citizens and in some cases a waiver of fees , an initiative preliminarily agreed to this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once cozy relations with russia are warming again the main subtext of the summit , however , is the future of eu-ukraine relations .
the eu lent strong support to yushchenko and the orange revolution in 2004 , but since then , the country 's orientation has become more uncertain as the government split , with only yushchenko and the foreign and defense ministers appointed by him looking to the west .
most of the rest of the government - and the majority of ukrainians who still back yanukovych - do not .
the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .
" yanukovych is better able to negotiate with russia and takes a more pragmatic approach , something badly needed .
and since he enjoys such support at home , maybe he can achieve more regarding the internal situation of the country .

but the subtext of the meetings is the future of eu-ukrainian relations after a pro-russian prime minister took over in september . there is always plenty to talk about when a former soviet satellite state knocks on the eu 's door .
this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
both sides want to reassure eu member states there will be no repeat of last year 's fiasco , when a russia-ukraine showdown over gas prices threatened supplies that transit through the ukraine to eu countries .
it reminded europeans of their russian energy dependence , some 80 percent of russian gas supplies to europe pass through the ukraine .
a deal made between ukraine and russia on tuesday secured supplies through 2007 , guaranteeing ukraine cheap fuel at almost half the market rates in exchange for closer cooperation between the two countries on foreign policy , particularly ukrainian aspirations to join the world trade organization and nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko wants to look west , not east " i would say quite openly that we need to synchronize the negotiation process of our countries regarding wto , " russian prime minister mikhail fradkov said after announcing the deal .
pro-russia stance paying off these days a new chapter has begun in eu-ukrainian relations as well as in russian-ukrainian relations .
pro-russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych again became prime minister in august after chaotic elections earlier this year and has worked to improve relations with its large neighbor .
in some ways , this has paid off for the ukraine and the eu so far - yanukovych was always the favored candidate of russia , especially during the 2004 elections that ushered in his opponent yushchenko and the so-called orange revolution .
it was yushchenko 's pro-eu stance that many say led russia to punish the ukraine - and its heavily energy intensive steel and chemical industries - by trying to double energy prices in january .
" ukraine is in a difficult situation as they must constantly maneuver between the west and russia , " said alexander rahr , an expert on russia and the former soviet states at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations .
" and they are particularly dependent on russia , even if they do n't like it . "
looking for a " beacon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strife within the ruling party helped the pro-russian faction that dependence is putting a damper on yushchenko 's eu aspirations .
in advance of the summit , the pro-western president said he wants the eu to be a " beacon " for the ukraine .
" a ship must always know what its destination harbor is , " yushchenko told finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat .
" the same holds true for our strivings for europe .
we would like to see the shine , the light that shows our country and our people what the destination is .
" please note that we are not asking when , " he added .
" we are only talking about the aim , the goal that should stay more or less in place .
everything else is the responsibility of my people and my country . "
hat in hand although he has not asked for formal talks on eu or nato accession , the president is not coming to finland without requests .
one is that the eu set up a free trade zone with kiev - the bloc is ukraine 's largest trade partner with exports valued at 7.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
travel is another of the issues on the ukrainian president 's card .
ukraine wants a simplified process for visas issued to its citizens and in some cases a waiver of fees , an initiative preliminarily agreed to this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once cozy relations with russia are warming again the main subtext of the summit , however , is the future of eu-ukraine relations .
the eu lent strong support to yushchenko and the orange revolution in 2004 , but since then , the country 's orientation has become more uncertain as the government split , with only yushchenko and the foreign and defense ministers appointed by him looking to the west .
most of the rest of the government - and the majority of ukrainians who still back yanukovych - do not .
the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .
" yanukovych is better able to negotiate with russia and takes a more pragmatic approach , something badly needed .

but the subtext of the meetings is the future of eu-ukrainian relations after a pro-russian prime minister took over in september . there is always plenty to talk about when a former soviet satellite state knocks on the eu 's door .
this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
both sides want to reassure eu member states there will be no repeat of last year 's fiasco , when a russia-ukraine showdown over gas prices threatened supplies that transit through the ukraine to eu countries .
it reminded europeans of their russian energy dependence , some 80 percent of russian gas supplies to europe pass through the ukraine .
a deal made between ukraine and russia on tuesday secured supplies through 2007 , guaranteeing ukraine cheap fuel at almost half the market rates in exchange for closer cooperation between the two countries on foreign policy , particularly ukrainian aspirations to join the world trade organization and nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko wants to look west , not east " i would say quite openly that we need to synchronize the negotiation process of our countries regarding wto , " russian prime minister mikhail fradkov said after announcing the deal .
pro-russia stance paying off these days a new chapter has begun in eu-ukrainian relations as well as in russian-ukrainian relations .
pro-russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych again became prime minister in august after chaotic elections earlier this year and has worked to improve relations with its large neighbor .
in some ways , this has paid off for the ukraine and the eu so far - yanukovych was always the favored candidate of russia , especially during the 2004 elections that ushered in his opponent yushchenko and the so-called orange revolution .
it was yushchenko 's pro-eu stance that many say led russia to punish the ukraine - and its heavily energy intensive steel and chemical industries - by trying to double energy prices in january .
" ukraine is in a difficult situation as they must constantly maneuver between the west and russia , " said alexander rahr , an expert on russia and the former soviet states at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations .
" and they are particularly dependent on russia , even if they do n't like it . "
looking for a " beacon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strife within the ruling party helped the pro-russian faction that dependence is putting a damper on yushchenko 's eu aspirations .
in advance of the summit , the pro-western president said he wants the eu to be a " beacon " for the ukraine .
" a ship must always know what its destination harbor is , " yushchenko told finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat .
" the same holds true for our strivings for europe .
we would like to see the shine , the light that shows our country and our people what the destination is .
" please note that we are not asking when , " he added .
" we are only talking about the aim , the goal that should stay more or less in place .
everything else is the responsibility of my people and my country . "
hat in hand although he has not asked for formal talks on eu or nato accession , the president is not coming to finland without requests .
one is that the eu set up a free trade zone with kiev - the bloc is ukraine 's largest trade partner with exports valued at 7.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
travel is another of the issues on the ukrainian president 's card .
ukraine wants a simplified process for visas issued to its citizens and in some cases a waiver of fees , an initiative preliminarily agreed to this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once cozy relations with russia are warming again the main subtext of the summit , however , is the future of eu-ukraine relations .
the eu lent strong support to yushchenko and the orange revolution in 2004 , but since then , the country 's orientation has become more uncertain as the government split , with only yushchenko and the foreign and defense ministers appointed by him looking to the west .
most of the rest of the government - and the majority of ukrainians who still back yanukovych - do not .
the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .
" yanukovych is better able to negotiate with russia and takes a more pragmatic approach , something badly needed .

most of the rest of the government - and the majority of ukrainians who still back yanukovych - do not .
the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .
" yanukovych is better able to negotiate with russia and takes a more pragmatic approach , something badly needed .
and since he enjoys such support at home , maybe he can achieve more regarding the internal situation of the country . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troubled ukraine eyes nato green light ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership .

-lrb- 27.03.2006 -rrb- pro-russia forces poised for comeback in key ukraine poll ukrainians went to the polls sunday , with pro-russian forces poised to make a strong comeback in the first electoral test for the nation 's feuding " orange revolution " leadership and its pro-western stance .
-lrb- 26.03.2006 -rrb- gas rivals putin and yushchenko meet and make up the russian and ukrainian presidents met after resolving a bitter dispute over gas prices but while both hailed the agreement as fair , the fallout of that fight still lingers for ukraine .

the berlin-based deutsche oper triggered a row last month by canceling the opera " idomeneo " because of fears of islamist violence over piece 's final scene showing the severed heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus , buddha and the ancient greek god poseidon . a tragedy set in ancient crete , " idomeneo " was removed from deutsche oper 's november schedule after police warned it could pose and " incalculable " security risk and possibly spark violent reactions from muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms was resonsible for row over artistic freedom the cancellation of four scheduled performances of " idomeneo " by opera head kirsten harms in september was condemned by politicians and artists who said germans should not bow to fears of terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called the decision crazy and chancellor angela merkel warned against " self-censorship out of fear . " despite the criticism , harms refused to put the production on again without an all-clear from police . no danger in staging opera after re-evaluating the situation , berlin police on thursday issued a statement stating that " the opera and its staff currently faced no concrete danger " if performances were held .
after receiving the police 's new analysis , the deutsche oper announced on friday it had begun preparations for reviving the opera .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police thought berlin opera hosue could be at risk of terrorist attacks " those in charge of the decision over whether to stage the mozart opera ' idomeneo ' ... have decided to aim for two performances this year , " the opera house said in a statement , adding that the earliest the production could be staged was in december , though it did not mention any specific dates . berlin 's state culture minister thomas flierl welcomed the decision .
flierl had previously called for the reinstatement of the opera because " people ca n't debate it unless it is being performed . " police said they would discuss possible security measures close to the date of the new performances of " idomeneo . " the row over " idomeneo " coincided with a government-sponsored conference to promote dialogue with the several million muslims in the country and came shortly after pope benedict xvi angered muslim leaders during a visit to his home in germany by referring to a medieval text linking islam to violence .

as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods . germany scrambled friday to limit the damage stemming from the publication of photographs of some of its servicemen in macabre and sometimes obscene poses with a human skull and skeleton in afghanistan . the images , one of which showed a skull next to a soldier 's exposed penis and first splashed across the mass-selling bild tabloid this week , have sparked disbelief and outrage in the country as well as fears of protests in the muslim world . german politicians have unanimously condemned the incidents and an official inquiry has already led to the suspension of two soldiers . " i 'm devastated and also worried , both about the abuse of islamic values as well as the yet unforeseeable consequences of these incidents , " said winfried nachtwei , defense policy spokesman of the opposition green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of german troops in afghanistan are involved in reconstruction work though defense experts have been at pains to point out that the incidents are isolated and that the entire 2,800-strong contingent of german peacekeepers in afghanistan should n't be tarred with the same brush , many are calling for a review of army training programs and the preparedness of german soldiers participating in overseas missions . the scandal coincides with the presentation to lawmakers this week of a new long-term national security policy , which predicts an increasingly important role for the armed forces abroad . training in cultural sensibilities " we have to ask whether the training that soldiers undergo is sufficient , " reinhold robbe , a social democrat parliamentarian and designated defense commissioner for the german parliament told broadcaster zdf . " though the soldiers are trained very well in defense tactics , we have to equip them with more intercultural sensibilities and moral values , " he said . thomas ruttig , an expert on afghanistan at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , said that military training for soldiers being sent to afghanistan did involve familiarizing them with the country 's traditions and cultural sensibilities . " soldiers usually are briefed by all kinds of experts and institutions on developing understanding and tolerance for other religions and supplied with all kinds of material and manuals on the region , " ruttig said .
" but of course there 's no guarantee they will read what 's handed out or that they 're not sleeping in class .

" we have to finally stop talking about all this being a one-off thing and pure coincidence , " said helmuth prieß , chairman of the darmstadt-based " working group of critical soldiers . " he pointed out that the bundeswehr has been rocked by a series of scandals within germany in recent years .
in june this year , a german newspaper reported that new recruits with a paratrooper squadron in the state of rheinland-palatinate were subjected to humiliating initiation rituals including stripping naked and being slapped with paddles . " we only hear a part of these incidents when they make it out into the open , but the real problem is much bigger , " said prieß , a former lieutenant . " being a soldier changes a person .
walking around with a loaded weapon in a foreign country , far away from everything that 's familiar and bound within group dynamics , does lead to brutalization and a loss of inhibitions , " he said . on friday , the bild newspaper published an interview with a man it said belonged to the army patrol responsible for the initial photos .
the witness was quoted as saying that macho culture and poor morale were to blame for the incidents in afghanistan . changing role , increasing demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly heading off to peackeeping missions overseas many experts agreed that part of the problem also lies in the changing role of the bundeswehr - away from being designed to protect germany from foreign armies to one actively and increasingly participating in peacekeeping missions in the world 's hottest spots .
at present , more than 9,000 german soldiers are deployed in peacekeeping missions around the world . " the thing with foreign deployments is that even a low-level soldier faces increased demands .
it 's a high-stress job , " said nachtwei .
" within one minute , he has to be capable of dialogue and reaching out to the local populace as well as ready to fight and repulse an attack .
that 's a challenge that practically does n't exist in any other profession . " " a hero is someone who opens his mouth " others point out that the bundeswehr has to also offer better pay packages in order to attract the right talent as well as take steps to encourage soldiers to report any wrongdoing they witness . the army needs to screen its candidates rigorously with the help of experienced independent and critical psychologists and doctors and make an effort to instill moral and ethical values in its recruits , said prieß .

it has been reluctant for the state to acquire the stake directly , preferring instead a private-sector solution . complex deal wirtschaftswoche noted that daimlerchrysler does not hold the stake directly , but via a non-operative subsidiary , dasa .
dasa 's share capital is held by daimlerchrysler , the city state authorities of hamburg , the dornier family and the messerschmitt foundation . under the complex deal , dasa would issue a convertible bond with a value of up to 49 percent of its enterprise value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads susidiary airbus is hurting , but has gotten some big orders recently the bond , which would be convertible into the eads shares , would be bought by a privately led investor consortium that included a number of public-sector regional state banks and the state-owned kfw redevelopment bank , wirtschaftswoche reported . dasa would use the money from the bond issue to reimburse its shareholders , enabling daimlerchrysler to pocket more money than it would raise from the sale of its shares via the open stock market , the magazine said . at the same time , daimlerchrysler would hold on to its eads voting rights until the bond came up for redemption .
such a construction would also help to fend off potential predators , the magazine said . chancellor angela merkel was scheduled to talk over the solution with the french and german eads co-chairmen , louis gallois and thomas enders , at a meeting in berlin in the next few days , wirtschaftswoche added . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus wins big in china with order for 150 jets , new plant troubled airplane manufacturer airbus got some good news finally .
on thursday , the company won a chinese order of 150 a320 aircraft and agreed to set up a plant in china , the world 's most lucrative aviation market .
-lrb- 26.10.2006 -rrb- germany undecided on role in eads in the minefield of national egos at the heart of eads , the german government seems undecided about how best to shore up its interests without being left to foot the bill if the aerospace giant 's finances deteriorate .
-lrb- 23.10.2006 -rrb- eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .

as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods . germany scrambled friday to limit the damage stemming from the publication of photographs of some of its servicemen in macabre and sometimes obscene poses with a human skull and skeleton in afghanistan . the images , one of which showed a skull next to a soldier 's exposed penis and first splashed across the mass-selling bild tabloid this week , have sparked disbelief and outrage in the country as well as fears of protests in the muslim world . german politicians have unanimously condemned the incidents and an official inquiry has already led to the suspension of two soldiers . " i 'm devastated and also worried , both about the abuse of islamic values as well as the yet unforeseeable consequences of these incidents , " said winfried nachtwei , defense policy spokesman of the opposition green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of german troops in afghanistan are involved in reconstruction work though defense experts have been at pains to point out that the incidents are isolated and that the entire 2,800-strong contingent of german peacekeepers in afghanistan should n't be tarred with the same brush , many are calling for a review of army training programs and the preparedness of german soldiers participating in overseas missions . the scandal coincides with the presentation to lawmakers this week of a new long-term national security policy , which predicts an increasingly important role for the armed forces abroad . training in cultural sensibilities " we have to ask whether the training that soldiers undergo is sufficient , " reinhold robbe , a social democrat parliamentarian and designated defense commissioner for the german parliament told broadcaster zdf . " though the soldiers are trained very well in defense tactics , we have to equip them with more intercultural sensibilities and moral values , " he said . thomas ruttig , an expert on afghanistan at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , said that military training for soldiers being sent to afghanistan did involve familiarizing them with the country 's traditions and cultural sensibilities . " soldiers usually are briefed by all kinds of experts and institutions on developing understanding and tolerance for other religions and supplied with all kinds of material and manuals on the region , " ruttig said .
" but of course there 's no guarantee they will read what 's handed out or that they 're not sleeping in class .

" we have to finally stop talking about all this being a one-off thing and pure coincidence , " said helmuth prieß , chairman of the darmstadt-based " working group of critical soldiers . " he pointed out that the bundeswehr has been rocked by a series of scandals within germany in recent years .
in june this year , a german newspaper reported that new recruits with a paratrooper squadron in the state of rheinland-palatinate were subjected to humiliating initiation rituals including stripping naked and being slapped with paddles . " we only hear a part of these incidents when they make it out into the open , but the real problem is much bigger , " said prieß , a former lieutenant . " being a soldier changes a person .
walking around with a loaded weapon in a foreign country , far away from everything that 's familiar and bound within group dynamics , does lead to brutalization and a loss of inhibitions , " he said . on friday , the bild newspaper published an interview with a man it said belonged to the army patrol responsible for the initial photos .
the witness was quoted as saying that macho culture and poor morale were to blame for the incidents in afghanistan . changing role , increasing demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly heading off to peackeeping missions overseas many experts agreed that part of the problem also lies in the changing role of the bundeswehr - away from being designed to protect germany from foreign armies to one actively and increasingly participating in peacekeeping missions in the world 's hottest spots .
at present , more than 9,000 german soldiers are deployed in peacekeeping missions around the world . " the thing with foreign deployments is that even a low-level soldier faces increased demands .
it 's a high-stress job , " said nachtwei .

that 's a challenge that practically does n't exist in any other profession . " " a hero is someone who opens his mouth " others point out that the bundeswehr has to also offer better pay packages in order to attract the right talent as well as take steps to encourage soldiers to report any wrongdoing they witness . the army needs to screen its candidates rigorously with the help of experienced independent and critical psychologists and doctors and make an effort to instill moral and ethical values in its recruits , said prieß .

as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods . germany scrambled friday to limit the damage stemming from the publication of photographs of some of its servicemen in macabre and sometimes obscene poses with a human skull and skeleton in afghanistan . the images , one of which showed a skull next to a soldier 's exposed penis and first splashed across the mass-selling bild tabloid this week , have sparked disbelief and outrage in the country as well as fears of protests in the muslim world . german politicians have unanimously condemned the incidents and an official inquiry has already led to the suspension of two soldiers . " i 'm devastated and also worried , both about the abuse of islamic values as well as the yet unforeseeable consequences of these incidents , " said winfried nachtwei , defense policy spokesman of the opposition green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of german troops in afghanistan are involved in reconstruction work though defense experts have been at pains to point out that the incidents are isolated and that the entire 2,800-strong contingent of german peacekeepers in afghanistan should n't be tarred with the same brush , many are calling for a review of army training programs and the preparedness of german soldiers participating in overseas missions . the scandal coincides with the presentation to lawmakers this week of a new long-term national security policy , which predicts an increasingly important role for the armed forces abroad . training in cultural sensibilities " we have to ask whether the training that soldiers undergo is sufficient , " reinhold robbe , a social democrat parliamentarian and designated defense commissioner for the german parliament told broadcaster zdf . " though the soldiers are trained very well in defense tactics , we have to equip them with more intercultural sensibilities and moral values , " he said . thomas ruttig , an expert on afghanistan at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , said that military training for soldiers being sent to afghanistan did involve familiarizing them with the country 's traditions and cultural sensibilities . " soldiers usually are briefed by all kinds of experts and institutions on developing understanding and tolerance for other religions and supplied with all kinds of material and manuals on the region , " ruttig said .
" but of course there 's no guarantee they will read what 's handed out or that they 're not sleeping in class . " not a one-off case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians called for increased cultural training for soldiers before they are deployed revelations of further photographs and media reports that a field of bones near kabul was used by international peacekeepers several times to stage grisly photo shoots , have however raised questions over whether such incidents may be more frequent than is claimed otherwise . " we have to finally stop talking about all this being a one-off thing and pure coincidence , " said helmuth prieß , chairman of the darmstadt-based " working group of critical soldiers . " he pointed out that the bundeswehr has been rocked by a series of scandals within germany in recent years .
in june this year , a german newspaper reported that new recruits with a paratrooper squadron in the state of rheinland-palatinate were subjected to humiliating initiation rituals including stripping naked and being slapped with paddles . " we only hear a part of these incidents when they make it out into the open , but the real problem is much bigger , " said prieß , a former lieutenant . " being a soldier changes a person .
walking around with a loaded weapon in a foreign country , far away from everything that 's familiar and bound within group dynamics , does lead to brutalization and a loss of inhibitions , " he said . on friday , the bild newspaper published an interview with a man it said belonged to the army patrol responsible for the initial photos .
the witness was quoted as saying that macho culture and poor morale were to blame for the incidents in afghanistan . changing role , increasing demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly heading off to peackeeping missions overseas many experts agreed that part of the problem also lies in the changing role of the bundeswehr - away from being designed to protect germany from foreign armies to one actively and increasingly participating in peacekeeping missions in the world 's hottest spots .
at present , more than 9,000 german soldiers are deployed in peacekeeping missions around the world . " the thing with foreign deployments is that even a low-level soldier faces increased demands .
it 's a high-stress job , " said nachtwei .
" within one minute , he has to be capable of dialogue and reaching out to the local populace as well as ready to fight and repulse an attack .
that 's a challenge that practically does n't exist in any other profession . " " a hero is someone who opens his mouth " others point out that the bundeswehr has to also offer better pay packages in order to attract the right talent as well as take steps to encourage soldiers to report any wrongdoing they witness . the army needs to screen its candidates rigorously with the help of experienced independent and critical psychologists and doctors and make an effort to instill moral and ethical values in its recruits , said prieß . " it has to be made clear to the soldiers that a hero is n't someone who keeps his mouth shut , but rather someone who opens it to protest against inhuman acts .

the man himself spoke up friday and revealed that he was in informal talks with the us soccer federation . will he or wo n't he ?
that 's the question that is looking closer to being answered friday regarding the employment status of former germany national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann . ever since the tear-stained departure of the man known and loved as " klinsi " from the germany set-up , a nation 's thanks ringing in his ears and some carefully removed knives from his back returned to their rightful owners , rumors have been circulating that klinsmann could take over the us national team . these rumors , buffeted by counter-speculation that klinsi was considering the slightly more spicy allure of mexico a little further south of his california home , have gained some credibility after reports revealed that the former stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham striker is in informal talks with the us soccer federation -lrb- ussf -rrb- . casual and relaxed discussions words from the man himself about the meeting with ussf president sunil gulati hint at a possible deal in the making : " we 've had a couple of conversations .
i 'm evaluating everything that comes up , " said klinsmann in an interview with the associated press .
" i 'll stay in touch with sunil and see what it leads to .
it 's a very casual and relaxed correspondence . " " sooner or later , i have to get back into coaching , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann left a nation in rapture gulati , who has refused to comment on his talks with any potential replacement , repeated on thursday that he hopes to have a new coach in place by the end of the year . klinsmann resigned as germany coach three days after the world cup after leading germany to the semi-finals where they lost to eventual winners italy .
his german team kept the party going for one more game by beating portugal in the third place play-off before klinsi announced that he wanted to spend more time with his family in los angeles . us lifestyle a problem for dfb , not so for suitors klinsi clashed on a number of occasions with the hierarchy at the germany football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- over his refusal to move back to the country of his birth before the world cup .
instead , klinsmann chose to commute , stirring anger in many traditionalists in the game . such a problem would not exist if he were to take up the role as successor to incumbent us coach bruce arena , who was told by gulati in mid-july that his contract would not be renewed . klinsmann remains the preferred candidate of the ussf and is the favorite of many to take over when arena leaves the post at the end of the year .
klinsmann introduced a number of stateside training and management techniques to the german set-up , prompting much criticism before the tournament . coaching techniques suited for us style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and jogi laid the foundations of a bright future a sports psychologist was employed , the team 's second kit was changed to the more positive color red and a number of non-sport related exercises were adopted to build concentration and togetherness .
discredited as new age hokum at the time , klinsi 's detractors were forced to eat large dollops of humble pie throughout june and july as his germany team rolled on . his techniques are now being utilized and advanced by his former assistant joachim löw , who now runs the team and ensures germany continues to build on the talented pool of youth at its disposal . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann hints at return for next world cup germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : installed thermia heat pump the " rock " technology is adaptable - in countries with very little bedrock , like the netherlands , the tube for collecting heat is simply laid in the ground water , which also keeps a steady temperature .
the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .
according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .
and for bergsjoe , the advantages of the pump system are obvious .
" this is a very environmentally friendly heating system .. because 75 % of the energy used by heat pumps is solar energy .
so it 's clean , it 's energy efficient and very good for the environment . "
obstacles to " rock energy " the are some negatives to the heat pump , such as the relatively high initial installation cost .
the system is adapted for water-based heating systems , but many european houses rely on gas or electric heaters .
this means they would need extensive upgrading before a heat pump and rock energy technology can be installed .
this wasn ’ t a problem for nils raambin in uppsala because the apartment blocks there already had water-based heaters .
raambin can only speak well of " rock energy " .
and there was another positive side effect - the water fountain in the middle of the square comes from ground water hit during drilling . "
we dug down a water pump in the hole .

the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !

according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .

the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .

it has been reluctant for the state to acquire the stake directly , preferring instead a private-sector solution . complex deal wirtschaftswoche noted that daimlerchrysler does not hold the stake directly , but via a non-operative subsidiary , dasa .
dasa 's share capital is held by daimlerchrysler , the city state authorities of hamburg , the dornier family and the messerschmitt foundation . under the complex deal , dasa would issue a convertible bond with a value of up to 49 percent of its enterprise value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads susidiary airbus is hurting , but has gotten some big orders recently the bond , which would be convertible into the eads shares , would be bought by a privately led investor consortium that included a number of public-sector regional state banks and the state-owned kfw redevelopment bank , wirtschaftswoche reported . dasa would use the money from the bond issue to reimburse its shareholders , enabling daimlerchrysler to pocket more money than it would raise from the sale of its shares via the open stock market , the magazine said . at the same time , daimlerchrysler would hold on to its eads voting rights until the bond came up for redemption .
such a construction would also help to fend off potential predators , the magazine said . chancellor angela merkel was scheduled to talk over the solution with the french and german eads co-chairmen , louis gallois and thomas enders , at a meeting in berlin in the next few days , wirtschaftswoche added . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus wins big in china with order for 150 jets , new plant troubled airplane manufacturer airbus got some good news finally .
on thursday , the company won a chinese order of 150 a320 aircraft and agreed to set up a plant in china , the world 's most lucrative aviation market .
-lrb- 26.10.2006 -rrb- germany undecided on role in eads in the minefield of national egos at the heart of eads , the german government seems undecided about how best to shore up its interests without being left to foot the bill if the aerospace giant 's finances deteriorate .

the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy proposed that a common immigration policy should be created for the european union at an informal meeting thursday in stratford-upon-avon , england .
the proposal aims to create an eu asylum authority and open up the eu 's labor market to temporary guest workers . under the proposal , workers from poor countries could live in eu countries for three to four years , transfer money to their home countries and return with newly acquired skills , schäuble said . the idea of such " circular migration " originates with the united nations and aims to combine migration with development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plan aims to curb illegal migration to the eu at the end of last year , a report by the global commission on international migration found the number of migrants around the world had risen to 200 million .
the report counted people who lived in a foreign country for more than one year and included 9.2 million refugees .
in 1972 , the number of migrants worldwide was 82 million . the report estimated that migrants sent $ 150 billion -lrb- 118 billion euros -rrb- to their families in their home countries in 2004 and that in many countries , without foreign workers , entire economic sectors would collapse . eu adoption british , italian and spanish polish interior ministers approved the proposal , which would have to be expanded and streamlined with a view to being adopted by the eu council of ministers at the eu summit in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu immigration control schäuble and sarkozy had also proposed that national immigration quotas be registered with brussels , which would enable the eu to repatriate illegal immigrants to their countries of origin more easily . " there are voices around this table from the right and from the left who are united in seeing the subject of immigration not as a thing of politics but of human drama , " sarkozy said . german skepticism german politicians , however , expressed skepticism about the " circular migration " idea .
the internal affairs spokesperson for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , dieter wiefelspütz , told the berliner zeitung daily that current rules were sufficient . " i ca n't see any need for temporary guest workers , " he said , referring to germany 's 4 million unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has seen an increase in illegal immigrants from sub-saharan africa the spokesperson for migration issues from the free-market liberal fdp party , sibylle laurischk , called the suggestion " naïve .

many of them stayed despite the government 's intention that they would return home after several years of work . the interior ministers of britain , germany , france , spain , italy and poland were taking part in the two-day meeting , which began wednesday with discussions on a joint policy to combat terrorism .

in 1972 , the number of migrants worldwide was 82 million . the report estimated that migrants sent $ 150 billion -lrb- 118 billion euros -rrb- to their families in their home countries in 2004 and that in many countries , without foreign workers , entire economic sectors would collapse . eu adoption british , italian and spanish polish interior ministers approved the proposal , which would have to be expanded and streamlined with a view to being adopted by the eu council of ministers at the eu summit in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu immigration control schäuble and sarkozy had also proposed that national immigration quotas be registered with brussels , which would enable the eu to repatriate illegal immigrants to their countries of origin more easily . " there are voices around this table from the right and from the left who are united in seeing the subject of immigration not as a thing of politics but of human drama , " sarkozy said . german skepticism german politicians , however , expressed skepticism about the " circular migration " idea .
the internal affairs spokesperson for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , dieter wiefelspütz , told the berliner zeitung daily that current rules were sufficient . " i ca n't see any need for temporary guest workers , " he said , referring to germany 's 4 million unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has seen an increase in illegal immigrants from sub-saharan africa the spokesperson for migration issues from the free-market liberal fdp party , sibylle laurischk , called the suggestion " naïve . " " evidently , they 've forgotten the lessons from the 1960 's , " she told the paper , referring to a period then germany brought many turkish guest workers into the country .
many of them stayed despite the government 's intention that they would return home after several years of work . the interior ministers of britain , germany , france , spain , italy and poland were taking part in the two-day meeting , which began wednesday with discussions on a joint policy to combat terrorism .
this so-called g6 was set up by britain and france in 2003 to provide an informal way for big eu countries to discuss issues of law and order and immigration . interior ministers also pledged to share more information about future terrorist threats and to fight eu value-added-tax fraud . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g6 ministers debate terrorism behind closed doors key european union ministers met in england on wednesday for talks on terrorism , illegal immigration and organized crime that critics fear will set an eu-wide security policy in virtual secrecy .

the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy proposed that a common immigration policy should be created for the european union at an informal meeting thursday in stratford-upon-avon , england .

in 1972 , the number of migrants worldwide was 82 million . the report estimated that migrants sent $ 150 billion -lrb- 118 billion euros -rrb- to their families in their home countries in 2004 and that in many countries , without foreign workers , entire economic sectors would collapse . eu adoption british , italian and spanish polish interior ministers approved the proposal , which would have to be expanded and streamlined with a view to being adopted by the eu council of ministers at the eu summit in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu immigration control schäuble and sarkozy had also proposed that national immigration quotas be registered with brussels , which would enable the eu to repatriate illegal immigrants to their countries of origin more easily .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german army fights to recover from skull scandal pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear afghan government " deeply saddened " by soldier scandal more photos surface in widening german skull scandal six germans questioned in skull scandal defense -pipe- 27.10.2006 skull scandal raises questions about army training methods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are german peacekeepers well prepared to participate in foreign deployments ?
as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods . germany scrambled friday to limit the damage stemming from the publication of photographs of some of its servicemen in macabre and sometimes obscene poses with a human skull and skeleton in afghanistan . the images , one of which showed a skull next to a soldier 's exposed penis and first splashed across the mass-selling bild tabloid this week , have sparked disbelief and outrage in the country as well as fears of protests in the muslim world . german politicians have unanimously condemned the incidents and an official inquiry has already led to the suspension of two soldiers . " i 'm devastated and also worried , both about the abuse of islamic values as well as the yet unforeseeable consequences of these incidents , " said winfried nachtwei , defense policy spokesman of the opposition green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of german troops in afghanistan are involved in reconstruction work though defense experts have been at pains to point out that the incidents are isolated and that the entire 2,800-strong contingent of german peacekeepers in afghanistan should n't be tarred with the same brush , many are calling for a review of army training programs and the preparedness of german soldiers participating in overseas missions . the scandal coincides with the presentation to lawmakers this week of a new long-term national security policy , which predicts an increasingly important role for the armed forces abroad . training in cultural sensibilities " we have to ask whether the training that soldiers undergo is sufficient , " reinhold robbe , a social democrat parliamentarian and designated defense commissioner for the german parliament told broadcaster zdf . " though the soldiers are trained very well in defense tactics , we have to equip them with more intercultural sensibilities and moral values , " he said . thomas ruttig , an expert on afghanistan at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , said that military training for soldiers being sent to afghanistan did involve familiarizing them with the country 's traditions and cultural sensibilities . " soldiers usually are briefed by all kinds of experts and institutions on developing understanding and tolerance for other religions and supplied with all kinds of material and manuals on the region , " ruttig said .
" but of course there 's no guarantee they will read what 's handed out or that they 're not sleeping in class . " not a one-off case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians called for increased cultural training for soldiers before they are deployed revelations of further photographs and media reports that a field of bones near kabul was used by international peacekeepers several times to stage grisly photo shoots , have however raised questions over whether such incidents may be more frequent than is claimed otherwise . " we have to finally stop talking about all this being a one-off thing and pure coincidence , " said helmuth prieß , chairman of the darmstadt-based " working group of critical soldiers . " he pointed out that the bundeswehr has been rocked by a series of scandals within germany in recent years .
in june this year , a german newspaper reported that new recruits with a paratrooper squadron in the state of rheinland-palatinate were subjected to humiliating initiation rituals including stripping naked and being slapped with paddles . " we only hear a part of these incidents when they make it out into the open , but the real problem is much bigger , " said prieß , a former lieutenant . " being a soldier changes a person .
walking around with a loaded weapon in a foreign country , far away from everything that 's familiar and bound within group dynamics , does lead to brutalization and a loss of inhibitions , " he said . on friday , the bild newspaper published an interview with a man it said belonged to the army patrol responsible for the initial photos .
the witness was quoted as saying that macho culture and poor morale were to blame for the incidents in afghanistan . changing role , increasing demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly heading off to peackeeping missions overseas many experts agreed that part of the problem also lies in the changing role of the bundeswehr - away from being designed to protect germany from foreign armies to one actively and increasingly participating in peacekeeping missions in the world 's hottest spots .
at present , more than 9,000 german soldiers are deployed in peacekeeping missions around the world . " the thing with foreign deployments is that even a low-level soldier faces increased demands .
it 's a high-stress job , " said nachtwei .
" within one minute , he has to be capable of dialogue and reaching out to the local populace as well as ready to fight and repulse an attack .
that 's a challenge that practically does n't exist in any other profession . " " a hero is someone who opens his mouth " others point out that the bundeswehr has to also offer better pay packages in order to attract the right talent as well as take steps to encourage soldiers to report any wrongdoing they witness . the army needs to screen its candidates rigorously with the help of experienced independent and critical psychologists and doctors and make an effort to instill moral and ethical values in its recruits , said prieß . " it has to be made clear to the soldiers that a hero is n't someone who keeps his mouth shut , but rather someone who opens it to protest against inhuman acts .

dw-world.de talked to henrik uterwedde about reactions of the french government and the continuing social gap . henrik uterwedde is deputy director of the franco-german institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern german .
he teaches political science at stuttgart university . dw-world.de : friday is the one-year anniversary of the riots in the french suburbs .
cars were again set on fire in the last couple of days .
the police secret service warns about an escalation . henrik uterwedde : there were repeated clashes , including incidents , where police officers , who wanted to check people , were ambushed by teenaged gangs .
moral barriers against readiness for violence have been torn down .
and it 's hard to erect them again . are these assaults the first signs of a new wave of violence ? at least you can not rule that out .
there are signs that the climate in the suburbs remains explosive .
experts , such as one of the mayors in the area , say : " we 're sitting on a powder keg . "
that 's because the roots of the crisis have not been eradicated .
you can not do away with 30 years of crisis-like developments within 12 months . what are the causes for the teenagers ' frustration ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their future 's not looking too bright so far first of all , it 's a deep social crisis .
about 700 hot spot quarters exist in france 's metropolitan areas and almost 5 million people live there .
these areas are monocultures .
forty percent of youngsters who live there do n't have a high school diploma .
the unemployment rate is twice as high as in the rest of france .
there 's a conglomeration of all social problems the country is facing .
on top of that , you have an integration crisis .
teenagers from immigrant families are especially discriminated against when they 're looking for work .
it 's not enough to criminalize teenagers and employ a law and order policy to restore peace - as interior minister sarkozy has been doing in a very populist way . the government has announced several initiatives following the riots last year .
which political steps have been taken ? even before 2005 , useful programs existed that tried to diffuse hot spots of social conflict .
following the riots , there were four measures .
people tried to improve the chances of employment for the teenagers in metropolitan areas .
steps have been taken to combat ethnic discrimination .
another , very expensive , program is that of urban planning .
there 's a tremendous problem with the clusters of apartment towers .
a renovation project has been set up .
the fourth step deal with repression .
of course the state can not tolerate the creation of lawless areas .
but all of these measures will not lead to swift successes . do you think these are steps in the right direction ? yes , i think so .
the most visible results are the ones resulting from the renovation of living space .
all other initiatives will take longer .
employment , of course , is dependent on the economy , which is not doing that great at the moment .
failure in school is another big problem .
we know that the chances to find employment rise with success in school .
but a few extra teachers wo n't be enough to fight this problem . what 's happening to address the issue of discrimination against teenagers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik uterwedde you can outlaw discrimination .
but try to change the mentality of a small business owner , who has reservations about immigrants .
there are some cases of positive discrimination .
one of the biggest elite universities , the sciences po , the institute for political science in paris , has made a kind of contract with some selected high schools in hot spot areas .
it allows a certain contingent of students from these areas to study at the university . the police union has warned that the violence is starting to take on islamist undertones ... judging by last year 's riots , you can not say that .
quite to the contrary , there were some representatives of muslim communities that became important contact people for the mayors because they were the only ones left that still had some influence over the teenagers .
in a powder keg , you can not rule out such a development .
but i do n't see this as a danger right now . ercin özlü interviewed henrik uterwedde -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new french film highlights roots of bias against north africans a recently released french film has sparked renewed debate over discrimination against north africans - and may have prompted president jacques chirac to redress an egregious imbalance .

-lrb- 01.04.2006 -rrb- rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .
could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical .

that 's the question that is looking closer to being answered friday regarding the employment status of former germany national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann . ever since the tear-stained departure of the man known and loved as " klinsi " from the germany set-up , a nation 's thanks ringing in his ears and some carefully removed knives from his back returned to their rightful owners , rumors have been circulating that klinsmann could take over the us national team . these rumors , buffeted by counter-speculation that klinsi was considering the slightly more spicy allure of mexico a little further south of his california home , have gained some credibility after reports revealed that the former stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham striker is in informal talks with the us soccer federation -lrb- ussf -rrb- . casual and relaxed discussions words from the man himself about the meeting with ussf president sunil gulati hint at a possible deal in the making : " we 've had a couple of conversations .

instead , klinsmann chose to commute , stirring anger in many traditionalists in the game . such a problem would not exist if he were to take up the role as successor to incumbent us coach bruce arena , who was told by gulati in mid-july that his contract would not be renewed . klinsmann remains the preferred candidate of the ussf and is the favorite of many to take over when arena leaves the post at the end of the year .
klinsmann introduced a number of stateside training and management techniques to the german set-up , prompting much criticism before the tournament . coaching techniques suited for us style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and jogi laid the foundations of a bright future a sports psychologist was employed , the team 's second kit was changed to the more positive color red and a number of non-sport related exercises were adopted to build concentration and togetherness .
discredited as new age hokum at the time , klinsi 's detractors were forced to eat large dollops of humble pie throughout june and july as his germany team rolled on . his techniques are now being utilized and advanced by his former assistant joachim löw , who now runs the team and ensures germany continues to build on the talented pool of youth at its disposal . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann hints at return for next world cup germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .

but it did n't used to be that way .
for a long time , it was heavily polluted . people used to gravitate toward the rhine river for all sorts of play - even swimming despite the dangerous currents .
legend has it that in winter , part of the rhine used to freeze over , and people would walk across the mighty waterway . the river begins in switzerland .
passing through the city of basel , it forms the border between germany and france , flows into germany and the netherlands and ends in the north sea . but in the wake of an environmental disaster 20 years ago in switzerland , many stayed away from the water , with experts wondering if it would ever be clean again .
at a recent press conference , an international commission said the rhine is a " living " river once more . polluted with pesticides in 1986 , a fire broke out in a production plant storage room at the pharmaceutical company sandoz in the swiss city of basel .
as a result , huge amounts of pesticides were released into the upper rhine , killing a multitude of fish and micro-organisms . the accident turned the river into europe 's biggest sewer . fritz holzwarth , head of the bonn-based international commission for the protection of the rhine , said that it was this catastrophe that triggered concern about the river 's health . " we can say that the sandoz incident was basically the worst possible scenario at the time so it contributed a great deal to making the protection of water an important issue in politics , " he said . a huge task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairy-tale beauty along the waterway 's twists and turns it would take a lot of effort before the river could be transformed into a place where people could swim again .
ultimately , it was pressure from an outraged public that forced politicians to take fast action . since then , investments in industrial and public water purification plants have amounted to 60 billion euros -lrb- over $ 75 billion -rrb- , with local governments investing a yearly amount of one billion euros in water purification . the risk of another dramatic accident has been minimized since the companies located along the rhine have taken precautions , holzwarth said , adding that a pro-active approach is necessary to keep the river clean . " the international commission for the protection of the rhine , together with those who live near the river 's banks , want to advance a perspective that allows people to live with and enjoy the river , " he said .
" we want to include the river in our lives and in those of our children , " he added . to that end , a 320-kilometer-long -lrb- nearly 200-mile -rrb- hiking trail called the rheinsteig was recently completed between bonn and koblenz . in addition , the rhine , europe 's most densely populated river , is a unesco world heritage site .

the berlin-based deutsche oper triggered a row last month by canceling the opera " idomeneo " because of fears of islamist violence over piece 's final scene showing the severed heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus , buddha and the ancient greek god poseidon . a tragedy set in ancient crete , " idomeneo " was removed from deutsche oper 's november schedule after police warned it could pose and " incalculable " security risk and possibly spark violent reactions from muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms was resonsible for row over artistic freedom the cancellation of four scheduled performances of " idomeneo " by opera head kirsten harms in september was condemned by politicians and artists who said germans should not bow to fears of terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called the decision crazy and chancellor angela merkel warned against " self-censorship out of fear . " despite the criticism , harms refused to put the production on again without an all-clear from police . no danger in staging opera after re-evaluating the situation , berlin police on thursday issued a statement stating that " the opera and its staff currently faced no concrete danger " if performances were held .
after receiving the police 's new analysis , the deutsche oper announced on friday it had begun preparations for reviving the opera .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police thought berlin opera hosue could be at risk of terrorist attacks " those in charge of the decision over whether to stage the mozart opera ' idomeneo ' ... have decided to aim for two performances this year , " the opera house said in a statement , adding that the earliest the production could be staged was in december , though it did not mention any specific dates . berlin 's state culture minister thomas flierl welcomed the decision .
flierl had previously called for the reinstatement of the opera because " people ca n't debate it unless it is being performed . " police said they would discuss possible security measures close to the date of the new performances of " idomeneo . " the row over " idomeneo " coincided with a government-sponsored conference to promote dialogue with the several million muslims in the country and came shortly after pope benedict xvi angered muslim leaders during a visit to his home in germany by referring to a medieval text linking islam to violence .
integration has become a priority for the government as concern grows about islamic radicalization across europe and the emergence of an underclass of disillusioned young muslims , mainly turks , in germany . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de political and cultural leaders condemn opera cancellation a violent scene with images of the prophet mohammed led berlin 's german opera to take mozart 's " idomeneo " from the schedule .

the berlin-based deutsche oper triggered a row last month by canceling the opera " idomeneo " because of fears of islamist violence over piece 's final scene showing the severed heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus , buddha and the ancient greek god poseidon . a tragedy set in ancient crete , " idomeneo " was removed from deutsche oper 's november schedule after police warned it could pose and " incalculable " security risk and possibly spark violent reactions from muslims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirsten harms was resonsible for row over artistic freedom the cancellation of four scheduled performances of " idomeneo " by opera head kirsten harms in september was condemned by politicians and artists who said germans should not bow to fears of terrorism . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble called the decision crazy and chancellor angela merkel warned against " self-censorship out of fear . " despite the criticism , harms refused to put the production on again without an all-clear from police . no danger in staging opera after re-evaluating the situation , berlin police on thursday issued a statement stating that " the opera and its staff currently faced no concrete danger " if performances were held .
after receiving the police 's new analysis , the deutsche oper announced on friday it had begun preparations for reviving the opera .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police thought berlin opera hosue could be at risk of terrorist attacks " those in charge of the decision over whether to stage the mozart opera ' idomeneo ' ... have decided to aim for two performances this year , " the opera house said in a statement , adding that the earliest the production could be staged was in december , though it did not mention any specific dates . berlin 's state culture minister thomas flierl welcomed the decision .
flierl had previously called for the reinstatement of the opera because " people ca n't debate it unless it is being performed . " police said they would discuss possible security measures close to the date of the new performances of " idomeneo . " the row over " idomeneo " coincided with a government-sponsored conference to promote dialogue with the several million muslims in the country and came shortly after pope benedict xvi angered muslim leaders during a visit to his home in germany by referring to a medieval text linking islam to violence .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : installed thermia heat pump the " rock " technology is adaptable - in countries with very little bedrock , like the netherlands , the tube for collecting heat is simply laid in the ground water , which also keeps a steady temperature .
the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .
according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .
and for bergsjoe , the advantages of the pump system are obvious .
" this is a very environmentally friendly heating system .. because 75 % of the energy used by heat pumps is solar energy .
so it 's clean , it 's energy efficient and very good for the environment . "
obstacles to " rock energy " the are some negatives to the heat pump , such as the relatively high initial installation cost .
the system is adapted for water-based heating systems , but many european houses rely on gas or electric heaters .
this means they would need extensive upgrading before a heat pump and rock energy technology can be installed .
this wasn ’ t a problem for nils raambin in uppsala because the apartment blocks there already had water-based heaters .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : installed thermia heat pump the " rock " technology is adaptable - in countries with very little bedrock , like the netherlands , the tube for collecting heat is simply laid in the ground water , which also keeps a steady temperature .
the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .
according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .
and for bergsjoe , the advantages of the pump system are obvious .
" this is a very environmentally friendly heating system .. because 75 % of the energy used by heat pumps is solar energy .
so it 's clean , it 's energy efficient and very good for the environment . "
obstacles to " rock energy " the are some negatives to the heat pump , such as the relatively high initial installation cost .
the system is adapted for water-based heating systems , but many european houses rely on gas or electric heaters .
this means they would need extensive upgrading before a heat pump and rock energy technology can be installed .
this wasn ’ t a problem for nils raambin in uppsala because the apartment blocks there already had water-based heaters .
raambin can only speak well of " rock energy " .
and there was another positive side effect - the water fountain in the middle of the square comes from ground water hit during drilling . "
we dug down a water pump in the hole .
so , that 's for free too , " raambin said . lars bevanger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic heating with rocks in sweden www-links international energy association geothermal links further information about geothermal technology geothermie germany german portal on geothermal energy -lrb- in german -rrb- 9798 dw-tv europe live made in germany we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

in a third photograph , several skulls are piled on top of each to form a pyramid . rtl officials said the pictures were taken with a digital camera and dated from march 2004 , making them roughly a year younger than the photographs of soldiers and skulls published in germany 's bild tabloid on wednesday .
they show soldiers posing with a skull mounted on a patrol vehicle bearing the german flag and the acronym isaf .
in one picture , a soldier in a camouflage uniform holds the skull next to his exposed penis . bild editors said they would publish further images saturday .
the images reportedly show a mock execution of a skeleton assembled from various human remains . the chief of staff of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , denied suggestions that the fact that a second set of pictures has come to light proved that such behavior was widespread among german troops .

he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : installed thermia heat pump the " rock " technology is adaptable - in countries with very little bedrock , like the netherlands , the tube for collecting heat is simply laid in the ground water , which also keeps a steady temperature .
the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .
according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .
and for bergsjoe , the advantages of the pump system are obvious .
" this is a very environmentally friendly heating system .. because 75 % of the energy used by heat pumps is solar energy .
so it 's clean , it 's energy efficient and very good for the environment . "
obstacles to " rock energy " the are some negatives to the heat pump , such as the relatively high initial installation cost .
the system is adapted for water-based heating systems , but many european houses rely on gas or electric heaters .
this means they would need extensive upgrading before a heat pump and rock energy technology can be installed .
this wasn ’ t a problem for nils raambin in uppsala because the apartment blocks there already had water-based heaters .
raambin can only speak well of " rock energy " .
and there was another positive side effect - the water fountain in the middle of the square comes from ground water hit during drilling . "
we dug down a water pump in the hole .

the berlin-based deutsche oper triggered a row last month by canceling the opera " idomeneo " because of fears of islamist violence over piece 's final scene showing the severed heads of the prophet mohammed , jesus , buddha and the ancient greek god poseidon . a tragedy set in ancient crete , " idomeneo " was removed from deutsche oper 's november schedule after police warned it could pose and " incalculable " security risk and possibly spark violent reactions from muslims .

" despite the criticism , harms refused to put the production on again without an all-clear from police . no danger in staging opera after re-evaluating the situation , berlin police on thursday issued a statement stating that " the opera and its staff currently faced no concrete danger " if performances were held .

flierl had previously called for the reinstatement of the opera because " people ca n't debate it unless it is being performed . " police said they would discuss possible security measures close to the date of the new performances of " idomeneo . " the row over " idomeneo " coincided with a government-sponsored conference to promote dialogue with the several million muslims in the country and came shortly after pope benedict xvi angered muslim leaders during a visit to his home in germany by referring to a medieval text linking islam to violence .

but it did n't used to be that way .
for a long time , it was heavily polluted . people used to gravitate toward the rhine river for all sorts of play - even swimming despite the dangerous currents .
legend has it that in winter , part of the rhine used to freeze over , and people would walk across the mighty waterway . the river begins in switzerland .
passing through the city of basel , it forms the border between germany and france , flows into germany and the netherlands and ends in the north sea . but in the wake of an environmental disaster 20 years ago in switzerland , many stayed away from the water , with experts wondering if it would ever be clean again .
at a recent press conference , an international commission said the rhine is a " living " river once more . polluted with pesticides in 1986 , a fire broke out in a production plant storage room at the pharmaceutical company sandoz in the swiss city of basel .
as a result , huge amounts of pesticides were released into the upper rhine , killing a multitude of fish and micro-organisms . the accident turned the river into europe 's biggest sewer . fritz holzwarth , head of the bonn-based international commission for the protection of the rhine , said that it was this catastrophe that triggered concern about the river 's health . " we can say that the sandoz incident was basically the worst possible scenario at the time so it contributed a great deal to making the protection of water an important issue in politics , " he said . a huge task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairy-tale beauty along the waterway 's twists and turns it would take a lot of effort before the river could be transformed into a place where people could swim again .
ultimately , it was pressure from an outraged public that forced politicians to take fast action . since then , investments in industrial and public water purification plants have amounted to 60 billion euros -lrb- over $ 75 billion -rrb- , with local governments investing a yearly amount of one billion euros in water purification . the risk of another dramatic accident has been minimized since the companies located along the rhine have taken precautions , holzwarth said , adding that a pro-active approach is necessary to keep the river clean . " the international commission for the protection of the rhine , together with those who live near the river 's banks , want to advance a perspective that allows people to live with and enjoy the river , " he said .
" we want to include the river in our lives and in those of our children , " he added . to that end , a 320-kilometer-long -lrb- nearly 200-mile -rrb- hiking trail called the rheinsteig was recently completed between bonn and koblenz . in addition , the rhine , europe 's most densely populated river , is a unesco world heritage site .

the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy proposed that a common immigration policy should be created for the european union at an informal meeting thursday in stratford-upon-avon , england .
the proposal aims to create an eu asylum authority and open up the eu 's labor market to temporary guest workers . under the proposal , workers from poor countries could live in eu countries for three to four years , transfer money to their home countries and return with newly acquired skills , schäuble said . the idea of such " circular migration " originates with the united nations and aims to combine migration with development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plan aims to curb illegal migration to the eu at the end of last year , a report by the global commission on international migration found the number of migrants around the world had risen to 200 million .
the report counted people who lived in a foreign country for more than one year and included 9.2 million refugees .
in 1972 , the number of migrants worldwide was 82 million . the report estimated that migrants sent $ 150 billion -lrb- 118 billion euros -rrb- to their families in their home countries in 2004 and that in many countries , without foreign workers , entire economic sectors would collapse . eu adoption british , italian and spanish polish interior ministers approved the proposal , which would have to be expanded and streamlined with a view to being adopted by the eu council of ministers at the eu summit in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu immigration control schäuble and sarkozy had also proposed that national immigration quotas be registered with brussels , which would enable the eu to repatriate illegal immigrants to their countries of origin more easily .

the internal affairs spokesperson for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , dieter wiefelspütz , told the berliner zeitung daily that current rules were sufficient .

many of them stayed despite the government 's intention that they would return home after several years of work . the interior ministers of britain , germany , france , spain , italy and poland were taking part in the two-day meeting , which began wednesday with discussions on a joint policy to combat terrorism .

the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy proposed that a common immigration policy should be created for the european union at an informal meeting thursday in stratford-upon-avon , england .
the proposal aims to create an eu asylum authority and open up the eu 's labor market to temporary guest workers . under the proposal , workers from poor countries could live in eu countries for three to four years , transfer money to their home countries and return with newly acquired skills , schäuble said . the idea of such " circular migration " originates with the united nations and aims to combine migration with development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plan aims to curb illegal migration to the eu at the end of last year , a report by the global commission on international migration found the number of migrants around the world had risen to 200 million .
the report counted people who lived in a foreign country for more than one year and included 9.2 million refugees .
in 1972 , the number of migrants worldwide was 82 million . the report estimated that migrants sent $ 150 billion -lrb- 118 billion euros -rrb- to their families in their home countries in 2004 and that in many countries , without foreign workers , entire economic sectors would collapse . eu adoption british , italian and spanish polish interior ministers approved the proposal , which would have to be expanded and streamlined with a view to being adopted by the eu council of ministers at the eu summit in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu immigration control schäuble and sarkozy had also proposed that national immigration quotas be registered with brussels , which would enable the eu to repatriate illegal immigrants to their countries of origin more easily . " there are voices around this table from the right and from the left who are united in seeing the subject of immigration not as a thing of politics but of human drama , " sarkozy said . german skepticism german politicians , however , expressed skepticism about the " circular migration " idea .
the internal affairs spokesperson for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , dieter wiefelspütz , told the berliner zeitung daily that current rules were sufficient .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 what 's the next step for eu-ukraine relations ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy issues loom large over the summit at an eu-ukraine summit friday , eu officials will discuss trade , visas and energy .
but the subtext of the meetings is the future of eu-ukrainian relations after a pro-russian prime minister took over in september . there is always plenty to talk about when a former soviet satellite state knocks on the eu 's door .
this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
both sides want to reassure eu member states there will be no repeat of last year 's fiasco , when a russia-ukraine showdown over gas prices threatened supplies that transit through the ukraine to eu countries .
it reminded europeans of their russian energy dependence , some 80 percent of russian gas supplies to europe pass through the ukraine .
a deal made between ukraine and russia on tuesday secured supplies through 2007 , guaranteeing ukraine cheap fuel at almost half the market rates in exchange for closer cooperation between the two countries on foreign policy , particularly ukrainian aspirations to join the world trade organization and nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko wants to look west , not east " i would say quite openly that we need to synchronize the negotiation process of our countries regarding wto , " russian prime minister mikhail fradkov said after announcing the deal .
pro-russia stance paying off these days a new chapter has begun in eu-ukrainian relations as well as in russian-ukrainian relations .
pro-russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych again became prime minister in august after chaotic elections earlier this year and has worked to improve relations with its large neighbor .
in some ways , this has paid off for the ukraine and the eu so far - yanukovych was always the favored candidate of russia , especially during the 2004 elections that ushered in his opponent yushchenko and the so-called orange revolution .
it was yushchenko 's pro-eu stance that many say led russia to punish the ukraine - and its heavily energy intensive steel and chemical industries - by trying to double energy prices in january .
" ukraine is in a difficult situation as they must constantly maneuver between the west and russia , " said alexander rahr , an expert on russia and the former soviet states at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations .
" and they are particularly dependent on russia , even if they do n't like it . "
looking for a " beacon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strife within the ruling party helped the pro-russian faction that dependence is putting a damper on yushchenko 's eu aspirations .
in advance of the summit , the pro-western president said he wants the eu to be a " beacon " for the ukraine .
" a ship must always know what its destination harbor is , " yushchenko told finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat .
" the same holds true for our strivings for europe .
we would like to see the shine , the light that shows our country and our people what the destination is .
" please note that we are not asking when , " he added .
" we are only talking about the aim , the goal that should stay more or less in place .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : installed thermia heat pump the " rock " technology is adaptable - in countries with very little bedrock , like the netherlands , the tube for collecting heat is simply laid in the ground water , which also keeps a steady temperature .
the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .
according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .
and for bergsjoe , the advantages of the pump system are obvious .
" this is a very environmentally friendly heating system .. because 75 % of the energy used by heat pumps is solar energy .
so it 's clean , it 's energy efficient and very good for the environment . "
obstacles to " rock energy " the are some negatives to the heat pump , such as the relatively high initial installation cost .
the system is adapted for water-based heating systems , but many european houses rely on gas or electric heaters .
this means they would need extensive upgrading before a heat pump and rock energy technology can be installed .
this wasn ’ t a problem for nils raambin in uppsala because the apartment blocks there already had water-based heaters .
raambin can only speak well of " rock energy " .
and there was another positive side effect - the water fountain in the middle of the square comes from ground water hit during drilling . "
we dug down a water pump in the hole .
so , that 's for free too , " raambin said . lars bevanger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic heating with rocks in sweden www-links international energy association geothermal links further information about geothermal technology geothermie germany german portal on geothermal energy -lrb- in german -rrb- 9798 dw-radio live newslink listen live dw on demand video on demand audio on demand audio / video podcasting © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : installed thermia heat pump the " rock " technology is adaptable - in countries with very little bedrock , like the netherlands , the tube for collecting heat is simply laid in the ground water , which also keeps a steady temperature .
the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .

it has been reluctant for the state to acquire the stake directly , preferring instead a private-sector solution . complex deal wirtschaftswoche noted that daimlerchrysler does not hold the stake directly , but via a non-operative subsidiary , dasa .
dasa 's share capital is held by daimlerchrysler , the city state authorities of hamburg , the dornier family and the messerschmitt foundation . under the complex deal , dasa would issue a convertible bond with a value of up to 49 percent of its enterprise value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads susidiary airbus is hurting , but has gotten some big orders recently the bond , which would be convertible into the eads shares , would be bought by a privately led investor consortium that included a number of public-sector regional state banks and the state-owned kfw redevelopment bank , wirtschaftswoche reported . dasa would use the money from the bond issue to reimburse its shareholders , enabling daimlerchrysler to pocket more money than it would raise from the sale of its shares via the open stock market , the magazine said . at the same time , daimlerchrysler would hold on to its eads voting rights until the bond came up for redemption .
such a construction would also help to fend off potential predators , the magazine said . chancellor angela merkel was scheduled to talk over the solution with the french and german eads co-chairmen , louis gallois and thomas enders , at a meeting in berlin in the next few days , wirtschaftswoche added . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus wins big in china with order for 150 jets , new plant troubled airplane manufacturer airbus got some good news finally .
on thursday , the company won a chinese order of 150 a320 aircraft and agreed to set up a plant in china , the world 's most lucrative aviation market .
-lrb- 26.10.2006 -rrb- germany undecided on role in eads in the minefield of national egos at the heart of eads , the german government seems undecided about how best to shore up its interests without being left to foot the bill if the aerospace giant 's finances deteriorate .

but the subtext of the meetings is the future of eu-ukrainian relations after a pro-russian prime minister took over in september . there is always plenty to talk about when a former soviet satellite state knocks on the eu 's door .
this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
both sides want to reassure eu member states there will be no repeat of last year 's fiasco , when a russia-ukraine showdown over gas prices threatened supplies that transit through the ukraine to eu countries .
it reminded europeans of their russian energy dependence , some 80 percent of russian gas supplies to europe pass through the ukraine .
a deal made between ukraine and russia on tuesday secured supplies through 2007 , guaranteeing ukraine cheap fuel at almost half the market rates in exchange for closer cooperation between the two countries on foreign policy , particularly ukrainian aspirations to join the world trade organization and nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko wants to look west , not east " i would say quite openly that we need to synchronize the negotiation process of our countries regarding wto , " russian prime minister mikhail fradkov said after announcing the deal .
pro-russia stance paying off these days a new chapter has begun in eu-ukrainian relations as well as in russian-ukrainian relations .
pro-russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych again became prime minister in august after chaotic elections earlier this year and has worked to improve relations with its large neighbor .
in some ways , this has paid off for the ukraine and the eu so far - yanukovych was always the favored candidate of russia , especially during the 2004 elections that ushered in his opponent yushchenko and the so-called orange revolution .
it was yushchenko 's pro-eu stance that many say led russia to punish the ukraine - and its heavily energy intensive steel and chemical industries - by trying to double energy prices in january .
" ukraine is in a difficult situation as they must constantly maneuver between the west and russia , " said alexander rahr , an expert on russia and the former soviet states at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations .
" and they are particularly dependent on russia , even if they do n't like it . "
looking for a " beacon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strife within the ruling party helped the pro-russian faction that dependence is putting a damper on yushchenko 's eu aspirations .
in advance of the summit , the pro-western president said he wants the eu to be a " beacon " for the ukraine .
" a ship must always know what its destination harbor is , " yushchenko told finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat .
" the same holds true for our strivings for europe .
we would like to see the shine , the light that shows our country and our people what the destination is .
" please note that we are not asking when , " he added .
" we are only talking about the aim , the goal that should stay more or less in place .
everything else is the responsibility of my people and my country . "
hat in hand although he has not asked for formal talks on eu or nato accession , the president is not coming to finland without requests .
one is that the eu set up a free trade zone with kiev - the bloc is ukraine 's largest trade partner with exports valued at 7.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
travel is another of the issues on the ukrainian president 's card .
ukraine wants a simplified process for visas issued to its citizens and in some cases a waiver of fees , an initiative preliminarily agreed to this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once cozy relations with russia are warming again the main subtext of the summit , however , is the future of eu-ukraine relations .
the eu lent strong support to yushchenko and the orange revolution in 2004 , but since then , the country 's orientation has become more uncertain as the government split , with only yushchenko and the foreign and defense ministers appointed by him looking to the west .
most of the rest of the government - and the majority of ukrainians who still back yanukovych - do not .
the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .
" yanukovych is better able to negotiate with russia and takes a more pragmatic approach , something badly needed .
and since he enjoys such support at home , maybe he can achieve more regarding the internal situation of the country . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troubled ukraine eyes nato green light ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership .

most of the rest of the government - and the majority of ukrainians who still back yanukovych - do not .
the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .
" yanukovych is better able to negotiate with russia and takes a more pragmatic approach , something badly needed .

it has been reluctant for the state to acquire the stake directly , preferring instead a private-sector solution . complex deal wirtschaftswoche noted that daimlerchrysler does not hold the stake directly , but via a non-operative subsidiary , dasa .
dasa 's share capital is held by daimlerchrysler , the city state authorities of hamburg , the dornier family and the messerschmitt foundation . under the complex deal , dasa would issue a convertible bond with a value of up to 49 percent of its enterprise value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads susidiary airbus is hurting , but has gotten some big orders recently the bond , which would be convertible into the eads shares , would be bought by a privately led investor consortium that included a number of public-sector regional state banks and the state-owned kfw redevelopment bank , wirtschaftswoche reported . dasa would use the money from the bond issue to reimburse its shareholders , enabling daimlerchrysler to pocket more money than it would raise from the sale of its shares via the open stock market , the magazine said . at the same time , daimlerchrysler would hold on to its eads voting rights until the bond came up for redemption .
such a construction would also help to fend off potential predators , the magazine said . chancellor angela merkel was scheduled to talk over the solution with the french and german eads co-chairmen , louis gallois and thomas enders , at a meeting in berlin in the next few days , wirtschaftswoche added . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus wins big in china with order for 150 jets , new plant troubled airplane manufacturer airbus got some good news finally .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : installed thermia heat pump the " rock " technology is adaptable - in countries with very little bedrock , like the netherlands , the tube for collecting heat is simply laid in the ground water , which also keeps a steady temperature .
the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .
according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .
and for bergsjoe , the advantages of the pump system are obvious .
" this is a very environmentally friendly heating system .. because 75 % of the energy used by heat pumps is solar energy .
so it 's clean , it 's energy efficient and very good for the environment . "
obstacles to " rock energy " the are some negatives to the heat pump , such as the relatively high initial installation cost .
the system is adapted for water-based heating systems , but many european houses rely on gas or electric heaters .
this means they would need extensive upgrading before a heat pump and rock energy technology can be installed .
this wasn ’ t a problem for nils raambin in uppsala because the apartment blocks there already had water-based heaters .
raambin can only speak well of " rock energy " .
and there was another positive side effect - the water fountain in the middle of the square comes from ground water hit during drilling . "
we dug down a water pump in the hole .
so , that 's for free too , " raambin said . lars bevanger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic heating with rocks in sweden www-links international energy association geothermal links further information about geothermal technology geothermie germany german portal on geothermal energy -lrb- in german -rrb- dw-radio live newslink plus listen live dw on demand video on demand audio on demand audio / video podcasting © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .

but the subtext of the meetings is the future of eu-ukrainian relations after a pro-russian prime minister took over in september . there is always plenty to talk about when a former soviet satellite state knocks on the eu 's door .
this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
both sides want to reassure eu member states there will be no repeat of last year 's fiasco , when a russia-ukraine showdown over gas prices threatened supplies that transit through the ukraine to eu countries .
it reminded europeans of their russian energy dependence , some 80 percent of russian gas supplies to europe pass through the ukraine .
a deal made between ukraine and russia on tuesday secured supplies through 2007 , guaranteeing ukraine cheap fuel at almost half the market rates in exchange for closer cooperation between the two countries on foreign policy , particularly ukrainian aspirations to join the world trade organization and nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko wants to look west , not east " i would say quite openly that we need to synchronize the negotiation process of our countries regarding wto , " russian prime minister mikhail fradkov said after announcing the deal .
pro-russia stance paying off these days a new chapter has begun in eu-ukrainian relations as well as in russian-ukrainian relations .
pro-russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych again became prime minister in august after chaotic elections earlier this year and has worked to improve relations with its large neighbor .
in some ways , this has paid off for the ukraine and the eu so far - yanukovych was always the favored candidate of russia , especially during the 2004 elections that ushered in his opponent yushchenko and the so-called orange revolution .
it was yushchenko 's pro-eu stance that many say led russia to punish the ukraine - and its heavily energy intensive steel and chemical industries - by trying to double energy prices in january .
" ukraine is in a difficult situation as they must constantly maneuver between the west and russia , " said alexander rahr , an expert on russia and the former soviet states at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations .
" and they are particularly dependent on russia , even if they do n't like it . "
looking for a " beacon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strife within the ruling party helped the pro-russian faction that dependence is putting a damper on yushchenko 's eu aspirations .
in advance of the summit , the pro-western president said he wants the eu to be a " beacon " for the ukraine .
" a ship must always know what its destination harbor is , " yushchenko told finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat .
" the same holds true for our strivings for europe .
we would like to see the shine , the light that shows our country and our people what the destination is .
" please note that we are not asking when , " he added .
" we are only talking about the aim , the goal that should stay more or less in place .
everything else is the responsibility of my people and my country . "
hat in hand although he has not asked for formal talks on eu or nato accession , the president is not coming to finland without requests .
one is that the eu set up a free trade zone with kiev - the bloc is ukraine 's largest trade partner with exports valued at 7.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
travel is another of the issues on the ukrainian president 's card .
ukraine wants a simplified process for visas issued to its citizens and in some cases a waiver of fees , an initiative preliminarily agreed to this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once cozy relations with russia are warming again the main subtext of the summit , however , is the future of eu-ukraine relations .
the eu lent strong support to yushchenko and the orange revolution in 2004 , but since then , the country 's orientation has become more uncertain as the government split , with only yushchenko and the foreign and defense ministers appointed by him looking to the west .
most of the rest of the government - and the majority of ukrainians who still back yanukovych - do not .
the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .
" yanukovych is better able to negotiate with russia and takes a more pragmatic approach , something badly needed .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : installed thermia heat pump the " rock " technology is adaptable - in countries with very little bedrock , like the netherlands , the tube for collecting heat is simply laid in the ground water , which also keeps a steady temperature .
the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .
according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .
and for bergsjoe , the advantages of the pump system are obvious .
" this is a very environmentally friendly heating system .. because 75 % of the energy used by heat pumps is solar energy .
so it 's clean , it 's energy efficient and very good for the environment . "
obstacles to " rock energy " the are some negatives to the heat pump , such as the relatively high initial installation cost .
the system is adapted for water-based heating systems , but many european houses rely on gas or electric heaters .
this means they would need extensive upgrading before a heat pump and rock energy technology can be installed .
this wasn ’ t a problem for nils raambin in uppsala because the apartment blocks there already had water-based heaters .
raambin can only speak well of " rock energy " .
and there was another positive side effect - the water fountain in the middle of the square comes from ground water hit during drilling . "
we dug down a water pump in the hole .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : installed thermia heat pump the " rock " technology is adaptable - in countries with very little bedrock , like the netherlands , the tube for collecting heat is simply laid in the ground water , which also keeps a steady temperature .
the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .
according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .
and for bergsjoe , the advantages of the pump system are obvious .
" this is a very environmentally friendly heating system .. because 75 % of the energy used by heat pumps is solar energy .
so it 's clean , it 's energy efficient and very good for the environment . "
obstacles to " rock energy " the are some negatives to the heat pump , such as the relatively high initial installation cost .
the system is adapted for water-based heating systems , but many european houses rely on gas or electric heaters .
this means they would need extensive upgrading before a heat pump and rock energy technology can be installed .
this wasn ’ t a problem for nils raambin in uppsala because the apartment blocks there already had water-based heaters .
raambin can only speak well of " rock energy " .
and there was another positive side effect - the water fountain in the middle of the square comes from ground water hit during drilling . "

but the subtext of the meetings is the future of eu-ukrainian relations after a pro-russian prime minister took over in september . there is always plenty to talk about when a former soviet satellite state knocks on the eu 's door .
this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
both sides want to reassure eu member states there will be no repeat of last year 's fiasco , when a russia-ukraine showdown over gas prices threatened supplies that transit through the ukraine to eu countries .
it reminded europeans of their russian energy dependence , some 80 percent of russian gas supplies to europe pass through the ukraine .
a deal made between ukraine and russia on tuesday secured supplies through 2007 , guaranteeing ukraine cheap fuel at almost half the market rates in exchange for closer cooperation between the two countries on foreign policy , particularly ukrainian aspirations to join the world trade organization and nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko wants to look west , not east " i would say quite openly that we need to synchronize the negotiation process of our countries regarding wto , " russian prime minister mikhail fradkov said after announcing the deal .
pro-russia stance paying off these days a new chapter has begun in eu-ukrainian relations as well as in russian-ukrainian relations .
pro-russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych again became prime minister in august after chaotic elections earlier this year and has worked to improve relations with its large neighbor .
in some ways , this has paid off for the ukraine and the eu so far - yanukovych was always the favored candidate of russia , especially during the 2004 elections that ushered in his opponent yushchenko and the so-called orange revolution .
it was yushchenko 's pro-eu stance that many say led russia to punish the ukraine - and its heavily energy intensive steel and chemical industries - by trying to double energy prices in january .
" ukraine is in a difficult situation as they must constantly maneuver between the west and russia , " said alexander rahr , an expert on russia and the former soviet states at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations .
" and they are particularly dependent on russia , even if they do n't like it . "
looking for a " beacon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strife within the ruling party helped the pro-russian faction that dependence is putting a damper on yushchenko 's eu aspirations .
in advance of the summit , the pro-western president said he wants the eu to be a " beacon " for the ukraine .
" a ship must always know what its destination harbor is , " yushchenko told finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat .
" the same holds true for our strivings for europe .
we would like to see the shine , the light that shows our country and our people what the destination is .
" please note that we are not asking when , " he added .
" we are only talking about the aim , the goal that should stay more or less in place .
everything else is the responsibility of my people and my country . "
hat in hand although he has not asked for formal talks on eu or nato accession , the president is not coming to finland without requests .
one is that the eu set up a free trade zone with kiev - the bloc is ukraine 's largest trade partner with exports valued at 7.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
travel is another of the issues on the ukrainian president 's card .
ukraine wants a simplified process for visas issued to its citizens and in some cases a waiver of fees , an initiative preliminarily agreed to this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once cozy relations with russia are warming again the main subtext of the summit , however , is the future of eu-ukraine relations .
the eu lent strong support to yushchenko and the orange revolution in 2004 , but since then , the country 's orientation has become more uncertain as the government split , with only yushchenko and the foreign and defense ministers appointed by him looking to the west .
most of the rest of the government - and the majority of ukrainians who still back yanukovych - do not .
the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .
" yanukovych is better able to negotiate with russia and takes a more pragmatic approach , something badly needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german army fights to recover from skull scandal pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear afghan government " deeply saddened " by soldier scandal more photos surface in widening german skull scandal six germans questioned in skull scandal defense -pipe- 27.10.2006 skull scandal raises questions about army training methods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are german peacekeepers well prepared to participate in foreign deployments ?
as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods . germany scrambled friday to limit the damage stemming from the publication of photographs of some of its servicemen in macabre and sometimes obscene poses with a human skull and skeleton in afghanistan . the images , one of which showed a skull next to a soldier 's exposed penis and first splashed across the mass-selling bild tabloid this week , have sparked disbelief and outrage in the country as well as fears of protests in the muslim world . german politicians have unanimously condemned the incidents and an official inquiry has already led to the suspension of two soldiers . " i 'm devastated and also worried , both about the abuse of islamic values as well as the yet unforeseeable consequences of these incidents , " said winfried nachtwei , defense policy spokesman of the opposition green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of german troops in afghanistan are involved in reconstruction work though defense experts have been at pains to point out that the incidents are isolated and that the entire 2,800-strong contingent of german peacekeepers in afghanistan should n't be tarred with the same brush , many are calling for a review of army training programs and the preparedness of german soldiers participating in overseas missions . the scandal coincides with the presentation to lawmakers this week of a new long-term national security policy , which predicts an increasingly important role for the armed forces abroad . training in cultural sensibilities " we have to ask whether the training that soldiers undergo is sufficient , " reinhold robbe , a social democrat parliamentarian and designated defense commissioner for the german parliament told broadcaster zdf . " though the soldiers are trained very well in defense tactics , we have to equip them with more intercultural sensibilities and moral values , " he said . thomas ruttig , an expert on afghanistan at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , said that military training for soldiers being sent to afghanistan did involve familiarizing them with the country 's traditions and cultural sensibilities . " soldiers usually are briefed by all kinds of experts and institutions on developing understanding and tolerance for other religions and supplied with all kinds of material and manuals on the region , " ruttig said .
" but of course there 's no guarantee they will read what 's handed out or that they 're not sleeping in class . " not a one-off case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians called for increased cultural training for soldiers before they are deployed revelations of further photographs and media reports that a field of bones near kabul was used by international peacekeepers several times to stage grisly photo shoots , have however raised questions over whether such incidents may be more frequent than is claimed otherwise . " we have to finally stop talking about all this being a one-off thing and pure coincidence , " said helmuth prieß , chairman of the darmstadt-based " working group of critical soldiers . " he pointed out that the bundeswehr has been rocked by a series of scandals within germany in recent years .
in june this year , a german newspaper reported that new recruits with a paratrooper squadron in the state of rheinland-palatinate were subjected to humiliating initiation rituals including stripping naked and being slapped with paddles . " we only hear a part of these incidents when they make it out into the open , but the real problem is much bigger , " said prieß , a former lieutenant . " being a soldier changes a person .
walking around with a loaded weapon in a foreign country , far away from everything that 's familiar and bound within group dynamics , does lead to brutalization and a loss of inhibitions , " he said . on friday , the bild newspaper published an interview with a man it said belonged to the army patrol responsible for the initial photos .
the witness was quoted as saying that macho culture and poor morale were to blame for the incidents in afghanistan . changing role , increasing demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly heading off to peackeeping missions overseas many experts agreed that part of the problem also lies in the changing role of the bundeswehr - away from being designed to protect germany from foreign armies to one actively and increasingly participating in peacekeeping missions in the world 's hottest spots .
at present , more than 9,000 german soldiers are deployed in peacekeeping missions around the world . " the thing with foreign deployments is that even a low-level soldier faces increased demands .
it 's a high-stress job , " said nachtwei .
" within one minute , he has to be capable of dialogue and reaching out to the local populace as well as ready to fight and repulse an attack .
that 's a challenge that practically does n't exist in any other profession . " " a hero is someone who opens his mouth " others point out that the bundeswehr has to also offer better pay packages in order to attract the right talent as well as take steps to encourage soldiers to report any wrongdoing they witness . the army needs to screen its candidates rigorously with the help of experienced independent and critical psychologists and doctors and make an effort to instill moral and ethical values in its recruits , said prieß . " it has to be made clear to the soldiers that a hero is n't someone who keeps his mouth shut , but rather someone who opens it to protest against inhuman acts . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de more photos surface in widening german skull scandal german defense ministry officials friday suspended two soldiers for their alleged part in the desecration of skulls in afghanistan .

as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods . germany scrambled friday to limit the damage stemming from the publication of photographs of some of its servicemen in macabre and sometimes obscene poses with a human skull and skeleton in afghanistan . the images , one of which showed a skull next to a soldier 's exposed penis and first splashed across the mass-selling bild tabloid this week , have sparked disbelief and outrage in the country as well as fears of protests in the muslim world . german politicians have unanimously condemned the incidents and an official inquiry has already led to the suspension of two soldiers .

as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods . germany scrambled friday to limit the damage stemming from the publication of photographs of some of its servicemen in macabre and sometimes obscene poses with a human skull and skeleton in afghanistan . the images , one of which showed a skull next to a soldier 's exposed penis and first splashed across the mass-selling bild tabloid this week , have sparked disbelief and outrage in the country as well as fears of protests in the muslim world . german politicians have unanimously condemned the incidents and an official inquiry has already led to the suspension of two soldiers . " i 'm devastated and also worried , both about the abuse of islamic values as well as the yet unforeseeable consequences of these incidents , " said winfried nachtwei , defense policy spokesman of the opposition green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of german troops in afghanistan are involved in reconstruction work though defense experts have been at pains to point out that the incidents are isolated and that the entire 2,800-strong contingent of german peacekeepers in afghanistan should n't be tarred with the same brush , many are calling for a review of army training programs and the preparedness of german soldiers participating in overseas missions . the scandal coincides with the presentation to lawmakers this week of a new long-term national security policy , which predicts an increasingly important role for the armed forces abroad . training in cultural sensibilities " we have to ask whether the training that soldiers undergo is sufficient , " reinhold robbe , a social democrat parliamentarian and designated defense commissioner for the german parliament told broadcaster zdf . " though the soldiers are trained very well in defense tactics , we have to equip them with more intercultural sensibilities and moral values , " he said . thomas ruttig , an expert on afghanistan at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , said that military training for soldiers being sent to afghanistan did involve familiarizing them with the country 's traditions and cultural sensibilities . " soldiers usually are briefed by all kinds of experts and institutions on developing understanding and tolerance for other religions and supplied with all kinds of material and manuals on the region , " ruttig said .
" but of course there 's no guarantee they will read what 's handed out or that they 're not sleeping in class . " not a one-off case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians called for increased cultural training for soldiers before they are deployed revelations of further photographs and media reports that a field of bones near kabul was used by international peacekeepers several times to stage grisly photo shoots , have however raised questions over whether such incidents may be more frequent than is claimed otherwise . " we have to finally stop talking about all this being a one-off thing and pure coincidence , " said helmuth prieß , chairman of the darmstadt-based " working group of critical soldiers . " he pointed out that the bundeswehr has been rocked by a series of scandals within germany in recent years .
in june this year , a german newspaper reported that new recruits with a paratrooper squadron in the state of rheinland-palatinate were subjected to humiliating initiation rituals including stripping naked and being slapped with paddles . " we only hear a part of these incidents when they make it out into the open , but the real problem is much bigger , " said prieß , a former lieutenant . " being a soldier changes a person .
walking around with a loaded weapon in a foreign country , far away from everything that 's familiar and bound within group dynamics , does lead to brutalization and a loss of inhibitions , " he said . on friday , the bild newspaper published an interview with a man it said belonged to the army patrol responsible for the initial photos .
the witness was quoted as saying that macho culture and poor morale were to blame for the incidents in afghanistan . changing role , increasing demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly heading off to peackeeping missions overseas many experts agreed that part of the problem also lies in the changing role of the bundeswehr - away from being designed to protect germany from foreign armies to one actively and increasingly participating in peacekeeping missions in the world 's hottest spots .
at present , more than 9,000 german soldiers are deployed in peacekeeping missions around the world . " the thing with foreign deployments is that even a low-level soldier faces increased demands .
it 's a high-stress job , " said nachtwei .
" within one minute , he has to be capable of dialogue and reaching out to the local populace as well as ready to fight and repulse an attack .
that 's a challenge that practically does n't exist in any other profession . " " a hero is someone who opens his mouth " others point out that the bundeswehr has to also offer better pay packages in order to attract the right talent as well as take steps to encourage soldiers to report any wrongdoing they witness . the army needs to screen its candidates rigorously with the help of experienced independent and critical psychologists and doctors and make an effort to instill moral and ethical values in its recruits , said prieß . " it has to be made clear to the soldiers that a hero is n't someone who keeps his mouth shut , but rather someone who opens it to protest against inhuman acts .

it has been reluctant for the state to acquire the stake directly , preferring instead a private-sector solution . complex deal wirtschaftswoche noted that daimlerchrysler does not hold the stake directly , but via a non-operative subsidiary , dasa .
dasa 's share capital is held by daimlerchrysler , the city state authorities of hamburg , the dornier family and the messerschmitt foundation . under the complex deal , dasa would issue a convertible bond with a value of up to 49 percent of its enterprise value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads susidiary airbus is hurting , but has gotten some big orders recently the bond , which would be convertible into the eads shares , would be bought by a privately led investor consortium that included a number of public-sector regional state banks and the state-owned kfw redevelopment bank , wirtschaftswoche reported . dasa would use the money from the bond issue to reimburse its shareholders , enabling daimlerchrysler to pocket more money than it would raise from the sale of its shares via the open stock market , the magazine said . at the same time , daimlerchrysler would hold on to its eads voting rights until the bond came up for redemption .

the scandal meanwhile widened as a tabloid said it would publish more photos saturday . defense minister franz josef jung said that the two men " will no longer be a part of the german army . "
four others , who had also been identified as having participated in taking the photographs , have since left the bundeswehr . german private tv channel rtl on thursday night showed pictures of a soldier kissing a skull that was lying on his shoulder and of another posing with a skull mounted on his patrol vehicle .
in a third photograph , several skulls are piled on top of each to form a pyramid . rtl officials said the pictures were taken with a digital camera and dated from march 2004 , making them roughly a year younger than the photographs of soldiers and skulls published in germany 's bild tabloid on wednesday .
they show soldiers posing with a skull mounted on a patrol vehicle bearing the german flag and the acronym isaf .
in one picture , a soldier in a camouflage uniform holds the skull next to his exposed penis . bild editors said they would publish further images saturday .
the images reportedly show a mock execution of a skeleton assembled from various human remains . the chief of staff of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , denied suggestions that the fact that a second set of pictures has come to light proved that such behavior was widespread among german troops . " it is another isolated case , " schneiderhan told rtl , but vowed that the soldiers involved would face a " merciless " inquiry .
state prosecutors have said they could face charges of disturbing the peace of the dead , which carries a prison sentence of up to three years . cemetery or pit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in afghanistan the bundeswehr said it appeared that the soldiers had found the skulls in a cemetery south of kabul .
but in an interview with bild , one of the soldiers involved in the incident said that soldiers found the bones during a patrol near a pit outside kabul . " it was where the afghans dug up the clay they needed to make bricks , " the unidentified soldier said .
" all these bones came out in the process .
it was not a cemetery , not a place of worship . " he said he was not forced to participate , but that people who refused to do so would have been called " wimps . " low inhibition threshold the man said that he should not have participated in the incident , but added that he and his comrades were tense at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an isaf ambulance near a place where german soldiers were killed in 2003 " it 's hard on the nerves when you 're constantly confronted with people from your own army or the allies getting hurt or die , " he said .
" i think that the inhibition threshold was low because of this . according to news reports , the location was well-known among soldiers stationed in afghanistan , who repeatedly came there to take photographs .
german opposition green party politician hans-christian ströbele said he had been told by at least half-a-dozen soldiers that there were hundreds of such photos in existence . german politicians and military officials have meanwhile called for a review of the bundeswehr 's training program to make sure that soldiers are well prepared for their missions . defense minister jung said a team of specialists would be traveling to afghanistan to assess conditions there .
he added that the bundeswehr would also review its training methods . afghan government condemns actions the afghan government meanwhile on friday " strongly condemned " friday the actions of german soldiers seen in photographs playing with human skulls in afghanistan and said their acts were against islamic values . the government called on " german authorities to investigate the matter , bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure such actions are not repeated , " the statement said . there has been little attention to the scandal in the afghan media , with most newspapers suspending publication over the eid holidays . insults to islam have sparked fierce reaction in conservative afghanistan .
an incident in which us soldiers in islamic afghanistan were captured on film burning the bodies of men said to be taliban fighters late last year caused outrage as it was disrespectful of the dead and against the tenets of islam . last year , the publication of danish cartoons deemed insulting of the prophet mohammad caused days of rioting across the country that left 11 people dead . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghan government " deeply saddened " by soldier scandal kabul has condemned photos published of german soldiers posing with a skull as being " against islamic values .

the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy proposed that a common immigration policy should be created for the european union at an informal meeting thursday in stratford-upon-avon , england .
the proposal aims to create an eu asylum authority and open up the eu 's labor market to temporary guest workers . under the proposal , workers from poor countries could live in eu countries for three to four years , transfer money to their home countries and return with newly acquired skills , schäuble said . the idea of such " circular migration " originates with the united nations and aims to combine migration with development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plan aims to curb illegal migration to the eu at the end of last year , a report by the global commission on international migration found the number of migrants around the world had risen to 200 million .
the report counted people who lived in a foreign country for more than one year and included 9.2 million refugees .
in 1972 , the number of migrants worldwide was 82 million . the report estimated that migrants sent $ 150 billion -lrb- 118 billion euros -rrb- to their families in their home countries in 2004 and that in many countries , without foreign workers , entire economic sectors would collapse . eu adoption british , italian and spanish polish interior ministers approved the proposal , which would have to be expanded and streamlined with a view to being adopted by the eu council of ministers at the eu summit in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu immigration control schäuble and sarkozy had also proposed that national immigration quotas be registered with brussels , which would enable the eu to repatriate illegal immigrants to their countries of origin more easily . " there are voices around this table from the right and from the left who are united in seeing the subject of immigration not as a thing of politics but of human drama , " sarkozy said . german skepticism german politicians , however , expressed skepticism about the " circular migration " idea .
the internal affairs spokesperson for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , dieter wiefelspütz , told the berliner zeitung daily that current rules were sufficient . " i ca n't see any need for temporary guest workers , " he said , referring to germany 's 4 million unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has seen an increase in illegal immigrants from sub-saharan africa the spokesperson for migration issues from the free-market liberal fdp party , sibylle laurischk , called the suggestion " naïve . " " evidently , they 've forgotten the lessons from the 1960 's , " she told the paper , referring to a period then germany brought many turkish guest workers into the country .
many of them stayed despite the government 's intention that they would return home after several years of work . the interior ministers of britain , germany , france , spain , italy and poland were taking part in the two-day meeting , which began wednesday with discussions on a joint policy to combat terrorism .
this so-called g6 was set up by britain and france in 2003 to provide an informal way for big eu countries to discuss issues of law and order and immigration . interior ministers also pledged to share more information about future terrorist threats and to fight eu value-added-tax fraud . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g6 ministers debate terrorism behind closed doors key european union ministers met in england on wednesday for talks on terrorism , illegal immigration and organized crime that critics fear will set an eu-wide security policy in virtual secrecy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 what 's the next step for eu-ukraine relations ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy issues loom large over the summit at an eu-ukraine summit friday , eu officials will discuss trade , visas and energy .
but the subtext of the meetings is the future of eu-ukrainian relations after a pro-russian prime minister took over in september . there is always plenty to talk about when a former soviet satellite state knocks on the eu 's door .
this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
both sides want to reassure eu member states there will be no repeat of last year 's fiasco , when a russia-ukraine showdown over gas prices threatened supplies that transit through the ukraine to eu countries .
it reminded europeans of their russian energy dependence , some 80 percent of russian gas supplies to europe pass through the ukraine .
a deal made between ukraine and russia on tuesday secured supplies through 2007 , guaranteeing ukraine cheap fuel at almost half the market rates in exchange for closer cooperation between the two countries on foreign policy , particularly ukrainian aspirations to join the world trade organization and nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko wants to look west , not east " i would say quite openly that we need to synchronize the negotiation process of our countries regarding wto , " russian prime minister mikhail fradkov said after announcing the deal .
pro-russia stance paying off these days a new chapter has begun in eu-ukrainian relations as well as in russian-ukrainian relations .
pro-russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych again became prime minister in august after chaotic elections earlier this year and has worked to improve relations with its large neighbor .
in some ways , this has paid off for the ukraine and the eu so far - yanukovych was always the favored candidate of russia , especially during the 2004 elections that ushered in his opponent yushchenko and the so-called orange revolution .
it was yushchenko 's pro-eu stance that many say led russia to punish the ukraine - and its heavily energy intensive steel and chemical industries - by trying to double energy prices in january .
" ukraine is in a difficult situation as they must constantly maneuver between the west and russia , " said alexander rahr , an expert on russia and the former soviet states at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations .
" and they are particularly dependent on russia , even if they do n't like it . "
looking for a " beacon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strife within the ruling party helped the pro-russian faction that dependence is putting a damper on yushchenko 's eu aspirations .
in advance of the summit , the pro-western president said he wants the eu to be a " beacon " for the ukraine .
" a ship must always know what its destination harbor is , " yushchenko told finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat .
" the same holds true for our strivings for europe .
we would like to see the shine , the light that shows our country and our people what the destination is .
" please note that we are not asking when , " he added .
" we are only talking about the aim , the goal that should stay more or less in place .
everything else is the responsibility of my people and my country . "
hat in hand although he has not asked for formal talks on eu or nato accession , the president is not coming to finland without requests .
one is that the eu set up a free trade zone with kiev - the bloc is ukraine 's largest trade partner with exports valued at 7.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
travel is another of the issues on the ukrainian president 's card .
ukraine wants a simplified process for visas issued to its citizens and in some cases a waiver of fees , an initiative preliminarily agreed to this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once cozy relations with russia are warming again the main subtext of the summit , however , is the future of eu-ukraine relations .
the eu lent strong support to yushchenko and the orange revolution in 2004 , but since then , the country 's orientation has become more uncertain as the government split , with only yushchenko and the foreign and defense ministers appointed by him looking to the west .
most of the rest of the government - and the majority of ukrainians who still back yanukovych - do not .
the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .
" yanukovych is better able to negotiate with russia and takes a more pragmatic approach , something badly needed .
and since he enjoys such support at home , maybe he can achieve more regarding the internal situation of the country . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troubled ukraine eyes nato green light ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership .
-lrb- 28.04.2006 -rrb- ukraine poll pushes ' orange ' rivals into each others ' arms ukraine 's parliamentary elections have dealt a humiliating personal blow to president viktor yushchenko but are likely to push his splintered " orange revolution " team back together , analysts said monday .
-lrb- 27.03.2006 -rrb- pro-russia forces poised for comeback in key ukraine poll ukrainians went to the polls sunday , with pro-russian forces poised to make a strong comeback in the first electoral test for the nation 's feuding " orange revolution " leadership and its pro-western stance .
-lrb- 26.03.2006 -rrb- gas rivals putin and yushchenko meet and make up the russian and ukrainian presidents met after resolving a bitter dispute over gas prices but while both hailed the agreement as fair , the fallout of that fight still lingers for ukraine .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : installed thermia heat pump the " rock " technology is adaptable - in countries with very little bedrock , like the netherlands , the tube for collecting heat is simply laid in the ground water , which also keeps a steady temperature .
the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .
according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .
and for bergsjoe , the advantages of the pump system are obvious .
" this is a very environmentally friendly heating system .. because 75 % of the energy used by heat pumps is solar energy .
so it 's clean , it 's energy efficient and very good for the environment . "
obstacles to " rock energy " the are some negatives to the heat pump , such as the relatively high initial installation cost .
the system is adapted for water-based heating systems , but many european houses rely on gas or electric heaters .
this means they would need extensive upgrading before a heat pump and rock energy technology can be installed .
this wasn ’ t a problem for nils raambin in uppsala because the apartment blocks there already had water-based heaters .
raambin can only speak well of " rock energy " .
and there was another positive side effect - the water fountain in the middle of the square comes from ground water hit during drilling . "
we dug down a water pump in the hole .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .

the man himself spoke up friday and revealed that he was in informal talks with the us soccer federation . will he or wo n't he ?
that 's the question that is looking closer to being answered friday regarding the employment status of former germany national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann . ever since the tear-stained departure of the man known and loved as " klinsi " from the germany set-up , a nation 's thanks ringing in his ears and some carefully removed knives from his back returned to their rightful owners , rumors have been circulating that klinsmann could take over the us national team . these rumors , buffeted by counter-speculation that klinsi was considering the slightly more spicy allure of mexico a little further south of his california home , have gained some credibility after reports revealed that the former stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham striker is in informal talks with the us soccer federation -lrb- ussf -rrb- . casual and relaxed discussions words from the man himself about the meeting with ussf president sunil gulati hint at a possible deal in the making : " we 've had a couple of conversations .
i 'm evaluating everything that comes up , " said klinsmann in an interview with the associated press .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german army fights to recover from skull scandal pressure grows on berlin after new afghan skull photos appear six germans questioned in skull scandal afghan government " deeply saddened " by soldier scandal germany outraged by afghan skull photos , orders probe defense -pipe- 27.10.2006 more photos surface in widening german skull scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung has been insisting that the desecrations were isolated cases german defense ministry officials friday suspended two soldiers for their alleged part in the desecration of skulls in afghanistan .
the scandal meanwhile widened as a tabloid said it would publish more photos saturday . defense minister franz josef jung said that the two men " will no longer be a part of the german army . "
four others , who had also been identified as having participated in taking the photographs , have since left the bundeswehr . german private tv channel rtl on thursday night showed pictures of a soldier kissing a skull that was lying on his shoulder and of another posing with a skull mounted on his patrol vehicle .
in a third photograph , several skulls are piled on top of each to form a pyramid . rtl officials said the pictures were taken with a digital camera and dated from march 2004 , making them roughly a year younger than the photographs of soldiers and skulls published in germany 's bild tabloid on wednesday .
they show soldiers posing with a skull mounted on a patrol vehicle bearing the german flag and the acronym isaf .
in one picture , a soldier in a camouflage uniform holds the skull next to his exposed penis . bild editors said they would publish further images saturday .
the images reportedly show a mock execution of a skeleton assembled from various human remains . the chief of staff of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , denied suggestions that the fact that a second set of pictures has come to light proved that such behavior was widespread among german troops . " it is another isolated case , " schneiderhan told rtl , but vowed that the soldiers involved would face a " merciless " inquiry .
state prosecutors have said they could face charges of disturbing the peace of the dead , which carries a prison sentence of up to three years . cemetery or pit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in afghanistan the bundeswehr said it appeared that the soldiers had found the skulls in a cemetery south of kabul .
but in an interview with bild , one of the soldiers involved in the incident said that soldiers found the bones during a patrol near a pit outside kabul . " it was where the afghans dug up the clay they needed to make bricks , " the unidentified soldier said .
" all these bones came out in the process .
it was not a cemetery , not a place of worship . " he said he was not forced to participate , but that people who refused to do so would have been called " wimps . " low inhibition threshold the man said that he should not have participated in the incident , but added that he and his comrades were tense at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an isaf ambulance near a place where german soldiers were killed in 2003 " it 's hard on the nerves when you 're constantly confronted with people from your own army or the allies getting hurt or die , " he said .
" i think that the inhibition threshold was low because of this . according to news reports , the location was well-known among soldiers stationed in afghanistan , who repeatedly came there to take photographs .
german opposition green party politician hans-christian ströbele said he had been told by at least half-a-dozen soldiers that there were hundreds of such photos in existence . german politicians and military officials have meanwhile called for a review of the bundeswehr 's training program to make sure that soldiers are well prepared for their missions . defense minister jung said a team of specialists would be traveling to afghanistan to assess conditions there .
he added that the bundeswehr would also review its training methods . afghan government condemns actions the afghan government meanwhile on friday " strongly condemned " friday the actions of german soldiers seen in photographs playing with human skulls in afghanistan and said their acts were against islamic values . the government called on " german authorities to investigate the matter , bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure such actions are not repeated , " the statement said . there has been little attention to the scandal in the afghan media , with most newspapers suspending publication over the eid holidays . insults to islam have sparked fierce reaction in conservative afghanistan .
an incident in which us soldiers in islamic afghanistan were captured on film burning the bodies of men said to be taliban fighters late last year caused outrage as it was disrespectful of the dead and against the tenets of islam . last year , the publication of danish cartoons deemed insulting of the prophet mohammad caused days of rioting across the country that left 11 people dead . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghan government " deeply saddened " by soldier scandal kabul has condemned photos published of german soldiers posing with a skull as being " against islamic values . "
the afghan trade minister said he fears effects similar to those in the wake of the mohammed cartoons .
-lrb- 26.10.2006 -rrb- press review : the fear of consequences the german and european press were united in the condemnation of the bundeswehr skull scandal and many feared reprisals on german troops in afghanistan while others searched for an explanation for the soldiers ' behavior .
-lrb- 26.10.2006 -rrb- opinion : the abhorrent exception to the rule german officials have reacted well to the alleged desecration of a skull by german soldiers , says dw 's peter philipp .
he hopes afghan authorities will follow suit .

the scandal meanwhile widened as a tabloid said it would publish more photos saturday . defense minister franz josef jung said that the two men " will no longer be a part of the german army . "
four others , who had also been identified as having participated in taking the photographs , have since left the bundeswehr . german private tv channel rtl on thursday night showed pictures of a soldier kissing a skull that was lying on his shoulder and of another posing with a skull mounted on his patrol vehicle .
in a third photograph , several skulls are piled on top of each to form a pyramid . rtl officials said the pictures were taken with a digital camera and dated from march 2004 , making them roughly a year younger than the photographs of soldiers and skulls published in germany 's bild tabloid on wednesday .
they show soldiers posing with a skull mounted on a patrol vehicle bearing the german flag and the acronym isaf .
in one picture , a soldier in a camouflage uniform holds the skull next to his exposed penis . bild editors said they would publish further images saturday .
the images reportedly show a mock execution of a skeleton assembled from various human remains . the chief of staff of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , denied suggestions that the fact that a second set of pictures has come to light proved that such behavior was widespread among german troops . " it is another isolated case , " schneiderhan told rtl , but vowed that the soldiers involved would face a " merciless " inquiry .
state prosecutors have said they could face charges of disturbing the peace of the dead , which carries a prison sentence of up to three years . cemetery or pit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in afghanistan the bundeswehr said it appeared that the soldiers had found the skulls in a cemetery south of kabul .
but in an interview with bild , one of the soldiers involved in the incident said that soldiers found the bones during a patrol near a pit outside kabul . " it was where the afghans dug up the clay they needed to make bricks , " the unidentified soldier said .
" all these bones came out in the process .
it was not a cemetery , not a place of worship . " he said he was not forced to participate , but that people who refused to do so would have been called " wimps . " low inhibition threshold the man said that he should not have participated in the incident , but added that he and his comrades were tense at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an isaf ambulance near a place where german soldiers were killed in 2003 " it 's hard on the nerves when you 're constantly confronted with people from your own army or the allies getting hurt or die , " he said .
" i think that the inhibition threshold was low because of this . according to news reports , the location was well-known among soldiers stationed in afghanistan , who repeatedly came there to take photographs .
german opposition green party politician hans-christian ströbele said he had been told by at least half-a-dozen soldiers that there were hundreds of such photos in existence . german politicians and military officials have meanwhile called for a review of the bundeswehr 's training program to make sure that soldiers are well prepared for their missions . defense minister jung said a team of specialists would be traveling to afghanistan to assess conditions there .
he added that the bundeswehr would also review its training methods . afghan government condemns actions the afghan government meanwhile on friday " strongly condemned " friday the actions of german soldiers seen in photographs playing with human skulls in afghanistan and said their acts were against islamic values . the government called on " german authorities to investigate the matter , bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure such actions are not repeated , " the statement said . there has been little attention to the scandal in the afghan media , with most newspapers suspending publication over the eid holidays . insults to islam have sparked fierce reaction in conservative afghanistan .
an incident in which us soldiers in islamic afghanistan were captured on film burning the bodies of men said to be taliban fighters late last year caused outrage as it was disrespectful of the dead and against the tenets of islam . last year , the publication of danish cartoons deemed insulting of the prophet mohammad caused days of rioting across the country that left 11 people dead . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghan government " deeply saddened " by soldier scandal kabul has condemned photos published of german soldiers posing with a skull as being " against islamic values . "

the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy proposed that a common immigration policy should be created for the european union at an informal meeting thursday in stratford-upon-avon , england .
the proposal aims to create an eu asylum authority and open up the eu 's labor market to temporary guest workers . under the proposal , workers from poor countries could live in eu countries for three to four years , transfer money to their home countries and return with newly acquired skills , schäuble said . the idea of such " circular migration " originates with the united nations and aims to combine migration with development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plan aims to curb illegal migration to the eu at the end of last year , a report by the global commission on international migration found the number of migrants around the world had risen to 200 million .
the report counted people who lived in a foreign country for more than one year and included 9.2 million refugees .
in 1972 , the number of migrants worldwide was 82 million . the report estimated that migrants sent $ 150 billion -lrb- 118 billion euros -rrb- to their families in their home countries in 2004 and that in many countries , without foreign workers , entire economic sectors would collapse . eu adoption british , italian and spanish polish interior ministers approved the proposal , which would have to be expanded and streamlined with a view to being adopted by the eu council of ministers at the eu summit in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu immigration control schäuble and sarkozy had also proposed that national immigration quotas be registered with brussels , which would enable the eu to repatriate illegal immigrants to their countries of origin more easily . " there are voices around this table from the right and from the left who are united in seeing the subject of immigration not as a thing of politics but of human drama , " sarkozy said . german skepticism german politicians , however , expressed skepticism about the " circular migration " idea .
the internal affairs spokesperson for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , dieter wiefelspütz , told the berliner zeitung daily that current rules were sufficient . " i ca n't see any need for temporary guest workers , " he said , referring to germany 's 4 million unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has seen an increase in illegal immigrants from sub-saharan africa the spokesperson for migration issues from the free-market liberal fdp party , sibylle laurischk , called the suggestion " naïve . " " evidently , they 've forgotten the lessons from the 1960 's , " she told the paper , referring to a period then germany brought many turkish guest workers into the country .
many of them stayed despite the government 's intention that they would return home after several years of work . the interior ministers of britain , germany , france , spain , italy and poland were taking part in the two-day meeting , which began wednesday with discussions on a joint policy to combat terrorism .
this so-called g6 was set up by britain and france in 2003 to provide an informal way for big eu countries to discuss issues of law and order and immigration . interior ministers also pledged to share more information about future terrorist threats and to fight eu value-added-tax fraud . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g6 ministers debate terrorism behind closed doors key european union ministers met in england on wednesday for talks on terrorism , illegal immigration and organized crime that critics fear will set an eu-wide security policy in virtual secrecy .

following the riots , there were four measures .
people tried to improve the chances of employment for the teenagers in metropolitan areas .
steps have been taken to combat ethnic discrimination .
another , very expensive , program is that of urban planning .
there 's a tremendous problem with the clusters of apartment towers .
a renovation project has been set up .
the fourth step deal with repression .
of course the state can not tolerate the creation of lawless areas .
but all of these measures will not lead to swift successes . do you think these are steps in the right direction ? yes , i think so .
the most visible results are the ones resulting from the renovation of living space .
all other initiatives will take longer .
employment , of course , is dependent on the economy , which is not doing that great at the moment .
failure in school is another big problem .
we know that the chances to find employment rise with success in school .
but a few extra teachers wo n't be enough to fight this problem . what 's happening to address the issue of discrimination against teenagers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik uterwedde you can outlaw discrimination .
but try to change the mentality of a small business owner , who has reservations about immigrants .
there are some cases of positive discrimination .
one of the biggest elite universities , the sciences po , the institute for political science in paris , has made a kind of contract with some selected high schools in hot spot areas .
it allows a certain contingent of students from these areas to study at the university . the police union has warned that the violence is starting to take on islamist undertones ... judging by last year 's riots , you can not say that .
quite to the contrary , there were some representatives of muslim communities that became important contact people for the mayors because they were the only ones left that still had some influence over the teenagers .
in a powder keg , you can not rule out such a development .
but i do n't see this as a danger right now . ercin özlü interviewed henrik uterwedde -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new french film highlights roots of bias against north africans a recently released french film has sparked renewed debate over discrimination against north africans - and may have prompted president jacques chirac to redress an egregious imbalance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 what 's the next step for eu-ukraine relations ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy issues loom large over the summit at an eu-ukraine summit friday , eu officials will discuss trade , visas and energy .
but the subtext of the meetings is the future of eu-ukrainian relations after a pro-russian prime minister took over in september . there is always plenty to talk about when a former soviet satellite state knocks on the eu 's door .
this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
both sides want to reassure eu member states there will be no repeat of last year 's fiasco , when a russia-ukraine showdown over gas prices threatened supplies that transit through the ukraine to eu countries .
it reminded europeans of their russian energy dependence , some 80 percent of russian gas supplies to europe pass through the ukraine .
a deal made between ukraine and russia on tuesday secured supplies through 2007 , guaranteeing ukraine cheap fuel at almost half the market rates in exchange for closer cooperation between the two countries on foreign policy , particularly ukrainian aspirations to join the world trade organization and nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko wants to look west , not east " i would say quite openly that we need to synchronize the negotiation process of our countries regarding wto , " russian prime minister mikhail fradkov said after announcing the deal .
pro-russia stance paying off these days a new chapter has begun in eu-ukrainian relations as well as in russian-ukrainian relations .
pro-russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych again became prime minister in august after chaotic elections earlier this year and has worked to improve relations with its large neighbor .
in some ways , this has paid off for the ukraine and the eu so far - yanukovych was always the favored candidate of russia , especially during the 2004 elections that ushered in his opponent yushchenko and the so-called orange revolution .
it was yushchenko 's pro-eu stance that many say led russia to punish the ukraine - and its heavily energy intensive steel and chemical industries - by trying to double energy prices in january .
" ukraine is in a difficult situation as they must constantly maneuver between the west and russia , " said alexander rahr , an expert on russia and the former soviet states at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations .
" and they are particularly dependent on russia , even if they do n't like it . "
looking for a " beacon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strife within the ruling party helped the pro-russian faction that dependence is putting a damper on yushchenko 's eu aspirations .
in advance of the summit , the pro-western president said he wants the eu to be a " beacon " for the ukraine .
" a ship must always know what its destination harbor is , " yushchenko told finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat .
" the same holds true for our strivings for europe .
we would like to see the shine , the light that shows our country and our people what the destination is .
" please note that we are not asking when , " he added .
" we are only talking about the aim , the goal that should stay more or less in place .
everything else is the responsibility of my people and my country . "
hat in hand although he has not asked for formal talks on eu or nato accession , the president is not coming to finland without requests .
one is that the eu set up a free trade zone with kiev - the bloc is ukraine 's largest trade partner with exports valued at 7.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
travel is another of the issues on the ukrainian president 's card .
ukraine wants a simplified process for visas issued to its citizens and in some cases a waiver of fees , an initiative preliminarily agreed to this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once cozy relations with russia are warming again the main subtext of the summit , however , is the future of eu-ukraine relations .
the eu lent strong support to yushchenko and the orange revolution in 2004 , but since then , the country 's orientation has become more uncertain as the government split , with only yushchenko and the foreign and defense ministers appointed by him looking to the west .
most of the rest of the government - and the majority of ukrainians who still back yanukovych - do not .
the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .
" yanukovych is better able to negotiate with russia and takes a more pragmatic approach , something badly needed .
and since he enjoys such support at home , maybe he can achieve more regarding the internal situation of the country . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troubled ukraine eyes nato green light ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership .

but the subtext of the meetings is the future of eu-ukrainian relations after a pro-russian prime minister took over in september . there is always plenty to talk about when a former soviet satellite state knocks on the eu 's door .
this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
both sides want to reassure eu member states there will be no repeat of last year 's fiasco , when a russia-ukraine showdown over gas prices threatened supplies that transit through the ukraine to eu countries .
it reminded europeans of their russian energy dependence , some 80 percent of russian gas supplies to europe pass through the ukraine .
a deal made between ukraine and russia on tuesday secured supplies through 2007 , guaranteeing ukraine cheap fuel at almost half the market rates in exchange for closer cooperation between the two countries on foreign policy , particularly ukrainian aspirations to join the world trade organization and nato .

pro-russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych again became prime minister in august after chaotic elections earlier this year and has worked to improve relations with its large neighbor .
in some ways , this has paid off for the ukraine and the eu so far - yanukovych was always the favored candidate of russia , especially during the 2004 elections that ushered in his opponent yushchenko and the so-called orange revolution .
it was yushchenko 's pro-eu stance that many say led russia to punish the ukraine - and its heavily energy intensive steel and chemical industries - by trying to double energy prices in january .
" ukraine is in a difficult situation as they must constantly maneuver between the west and russia , " said alexander rahr , an expert on russia and the former soviet states at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations .

in advance of the summit , the pro-western president said he wants the eu to be a " beacon " for the ukraine .
" a ship must always know what its destination harbor is , " yushchenko told finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat .
" the same holds true for our strivings for europe .
we would like to see the shine , the light that shows our country and our people what the destination is .

the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 what 's the next step for eu-ukraine relations ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy issues loom large over the summit at an eu-ukraine summit friday , eu officials will discuss trade , visas and energy .
but the subtext of the meetings is the future of eu-ukrainian relations after a pro-russian prime minister took over in september . there is always plenty to talk about when a former soviet satellite state knocks on the eu 's door .
this time around , at the eu-ukraine summit in helsinki on friday , the agenda is longer than usual .
that is because russian president vladimir putin angered western leaders by refusing to sign an energy agreement guaranteeing access to russian oil and gas last weekend .
thus , energy will be the hot topic when ukrainian president viktor yushchenko meets with finnish prime minister matti vanhanen and eu officials , including european commission president jose manuel barroso .
both sides want to reassure eu member states there will be no repeat of last year 's fiasco , when a russia-ukraine showdown over gas prices threatened supplies that transit through the ukraine to eu countries .
it reminded europeans of their russian energy dependence , some 80 percent of russian gas supplies to europe pass through the ukraine .
a deal made between ukraine and russia on tuesday secured supplies through 2007 , guaranteeing ukraine cheap fuel at almost half the market rates in exchange for closer cooperation between the two countries on foreign policy , particularly ukrainian aspirations to join the world trade organization and nato .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko wants to look west , not east " i would say quite openly that we need to synchronize the negotiation process of our countries regarding wto , " russian prime minister mikhail fradkov said after announcing the deal .
pro-russia stance paying off these days a new chapter has begun in eu-ukrainian relations as well as in russian-ukrainian relations .
pro-russian former prime minister viktor yanukovych again became prime minister in august after chaotic elections earlier this year and has worked to improve relations with its large neighbor .
in some ways , this has paid off for the ukraine and the eu so far - yanukovych was always the favored candidate of russia , especially during the 2004 elections that ushered in his opponent yushchenko and the so-called orange revolution .
it was yushchenko 's pro-eu stance that many say led russia to punish the ukraine - and its heavily energy intensive steel and chemical industries - by trying to double energy prices in january .
" ukraine is in a difficult situation as they must constantly maneuver between the west and russia , " said alexander rahr , an expert on russia and the former soviet states at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations .
" and they are particularly dependent on russia , even if they do n't like it . "
looking for a " beacon " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strife within the ruling party helped the pro-russian faction that dependence is putting a damper on yushchenko 's eu aspirations .
in advance of the summit , the pro-western president said he wants the eu to be a " beacon " for the ukraine .
" a ship must always know what its destination harbor is , " yushchenko told finnish newspaper helsingin sanomat .
" the same holds true for our strivings for europe .
we would like to see the shine , the light that shows our country and our people what the destination is .
" please note that we are not asking when , " he added .
" we are only talking about the aim , the goal that should stay more or less in place .
everything else is the responsibility of my people and my country . "
hat in hand although he has not asked for formal talks on eu or nato accession , the president is not coming to finland without requests .
one is that the eu set up a free trade zone with kiev - the bloc is ukraine 's largest trade partner with exports valued at 7.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.8 billion -rrb- in 2005 .
travel is another of the issues on the ukrainian president 's card .
ukraine wants a simplified process for visas issued to its citizens and in some cases a waiver of fees , an initiative preliminarily agreed to this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once cozy relations with russia are warming again the main subtext of the summit , however , is the future of eu-ukraine relations .
the eu lent strong support to yushchenko and the orange revolution in 2004 , but since then , the country 's orientation has become more uncertain as the government split , with only yushchenko and the foreign and defense ministers appointed by him looking to the west .
most of the rest of the government - and the majority of ukrainians who still back yanukovych - do not .
the eu states have come to realize that " these people are back , " rahr said , adding that the ukraine 's pro-russian prime minister might not be such a bad thing for the eu .
" western leaders might feel relieved that they need not keep promises made at an emotional time , " he said .
" yanukovych is better able to negotiate with russia and takes a more pragmatic approach , something badly needed .
and since he enjoys such support at home , maybe he can achieve more regarding the internal situation of the country . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troubled ukraine eyes nato green light ukraine reiterated friday its desire to join nato despite russian qualms , after the western alliance hinted heavily that the politically troubled ex-soviet state could soon win approval for membership .

the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy proposed that a common immigration policy should be created for the european union at an informal meeting thursday in stratford-upon-avon , england .
the proposal aims to create an eu asylum authority and open up the eu 's labor market to temporary guest workers . under the proposal , workers from poor countries could live in eu countries for three to four years , transfer money to their home countries and return with newly acquired skills , schäuble said . the idea of such " circular migration " originates with the united nations and aims to combine migration with development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plan aims to curb illegal migration to the eu at the end of last year , a report by the global commission on international migration found the number of migrants around the world had risen to 200 million .
the report counted people who lived in a foreign country for more than one year and included 9.2 million refugees .
in 1972 , the number of migrants worldwide was 82 million . the report estimated that migrants sent $ 150 billion -lrb- 118 billion euros -rrb- to their families in their home countries in 2004 and that in many countries , without foreign workers , entire economic sectors would collapse . eu adoption british , italian and spanish polish interior ministers approved the proposal , which would have to be expanded and streamlined with a view to being adopted by the eu council of ministers at the eu summit in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu immigration control schäuble and sarkozy had also proposed that national immigration quotas be registered with brussels , which would enable the eu to repatriate illegal immigrants to their countries of origin more easily . " there are voices around this table from the right and from the left who are united in seeing the subject of immigration not as a thing of politics but of human drama , " sarkozy said . german skepticism german politicians , however , expressed skepticism about the " circular migration " idea .
the internal affairs spokesperson for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , dieter wiefelspütz , told the berliner zeitung daily that current rules were sufficient . " i ca n't see any need for temporary guest workers , " he said , referring to germany 's 4 million unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has seen an increase in illegal immigrants from sub-saharan africa the spokesperson for migration issues from the free-market liberal fdp party , sibylle laurischk , called the suggestion " naïve . " " evidently , they 've forgotten the lessons from the 1960 's , " she told the paper , referring to a period then germany brought many turkish guest workers into the country .
many of them stayed despite the government 's intention that they would return home after several years of work . the interior ministers of britain , germany , france , spain , italy and poland were taking part in the two-day meeting , which began wednesday with discussions on a joint policy to combat terrorism .
this so-called g6 was set up by britain and france in 2003 to provide an informal way for big eu countries to discuss issues of law and order and immigration . interior ministers also pledged to share more information about future terrorist threats and to fight eu value-added-tax fraud . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g6 ministers debate terrorism behind closed doors key european union ministers met in england on wednesday for talks on terrorism , illegal immigration and organized crime that critics fear will set an eu-wide security policy in virtual secrecy .

that 's because the roots of the crisis have not been eradicated .
you can not do away with 30 years of crisis-like developments within 12 months . what are the causes for the teenagers ' frustration ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their future 's not looking too bright so far first of all , it 's a deep social crisis .
about 700 hot spot quarters exist in france 's metropolitan areas and almost 5 million people live there .
these areas are monocultures .
forty percent of youngsters who live there do n't have a high school diploma .
the unemployment rate is twice as high as in the rest of france .
there 's a conglomeration of all social problems the country is facing .
on top of that , you have an integration crisis .
teenagers from immigrant families are especially discriminated against when they 're looking for work .
it 's not enough to criminalize teenagers and employ a law and order policy to restore peace - as interior minister sarkozy has been doing in a very populist way . the government has announced several initiatives following the riots last year .
which political steps have been taken ? even before 2005 , useful programs existed that tried to diffuse hot spots of social conflict .
following the riots , there were four measures .
people tried to improve the chances of employment for the teenagers in metropolitan areas .
steps have been taken to combat ethnic discrimination .
another , very expensive , program is that of urban planning .
there 's a tremendous problem with the clusters of apartment towers .
a renovation project has been set up .
the fourth step deal with repression .
of course the state can not tolerate the creation of lawless areas .
but all of these measures will not lead to swift successes . do you think these are steps in the right direction ? yes , i think so .
the most visible results are the ones resulting from the renovation of living space .
all other initiatives will take longer .
employment , of course , is dependent on the economy , which is not doing that great at the moment .
failure in school is another big problem .
we know that the chances to find employment rise with success in school .
but a few extra teachers wo n't be enough to fight this problem . what 's happening to address the issue of discrimination against teenagers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik uterwedde you can outlaw discrimination .
but try to change the mentality of a small business owner , who has reservations about immigrants .
there are some cases of positive discrimination .
one of the biggest elite universities , the sciences po , the institute for political science in paris , has made a kind of contract with some selected high schools in hot spot areas .
it allows a certain contingent of students from these areas to study at the university . the police union has warned that the violence is starting to take on islamist undertones ... judging by last year 's riots , you can not say that .
quite to the contrary , there were some representatives of muslim communities that became important contact people for the mayors because they were the only ones left that still had some influence over the teenagers .
in a powder keg , you can not rule out such a development .
but i do n't see this as a danger right now . ercin özlü interviewed henrik uterwedde -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new french film highlights roots of bias against north africans a recently released french film has sparked renewed debate over discrimination against north africans - and may have prompted president jacques chirac to redress an egregious imbalance .

dw-world.de talked to henrik uterwedde about reactions of the french government and the continuing social gap . henrik uterwedde is deputy director of the franco-german institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern german .
he teaches political science at stuttgart university . dw-world.de : friday is the one-year anniversary of the riots in the french suburbs .
cars were again set on fire in the last couple of days .
the police secret service warns about an escalation . henrik uterwedde : there were repeated clashes , including incidents , where police officers , who wanted to check people , were ambushed by teenaged gangs .
moral barriers against readiness for violence have been torn down .
and it 's hard to erect them again . are these assaults the first signs of a new wave of violence ? at least you can not rule that out .
there are signs that the climate in the suburbs remains explosive .
experts , such as one of the mayors in the area , say : " we 're sitting on a powder keg . "
that 's because the roots of the crisis have not been eradicated .
you can not do away with 30 years of crisis-like developments within 12 months . what are the causes for the teenagers ' frustration ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their future 's not looking too bright so far first of all , it 's a deep social crisis .
about 700 hot spot quarters exist in france 's metropolitan areas and almost 5 million people live there .
these areas are monocultures .
forty percent of youngsters who live there do n't have a high school diploma .
the unemployment rate is twice as high as in the rest of france .
there 's a conglomeration of all social problems the country is facing .
on top of that , you have an integration crisis .
teenagers from immigrant families are especially discriminated against when they 're looking for work .
it 's not enough to criminalize teenagers and employ a law and order policy to restore peace - as interior minister sarkozy has been doing in a very populist way . the government has announced several initiatives following the riots last year .
which political steps have been taken ? even before 2005 , useful programs existed that tried to diffuse hot spots of social conflict .
following the riots , there were four measures .
people tried to improve the chances of employment for the teenagers in metropolitan areas .
steps have been taken to combat ethnic discrimination .
another , very expensive , program is that of urban planning .
there 's a tremendous problem with the clusters of apartment towers .
a renovation project has been set up .
the fourth step deal with repression .
of course the state can not tolerate the creation of lawless areas .
but all of these measures will not lead to swift successes . do you think these are steps in the right direction ? yes , i think so .
the most visible results are the ones resulting from the renovation of living space .
all other initiatives will take longer .
employment , of course , is dependent on the economy , which is not doing that great at the moment .
failure in school is another big problem .
we know that the chances to find employment rise with success in school .
but a few extra teachers wo n't be enough to fight this problem . what 's happening to address the issue of discrimination against teenagers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik uterwedde you can outlaw discrimination .
but try to change the mentality of a small business owner , who has reservations about immigrants .
there are some cases of positive discrimination .
one of the biggest elite universities , the sciences po , the institute for political science in paris , has made a kind of contract with some selected high schools in hot spot areas .
it allows a certain contingent of students from these areas to study at the university . the police union has warned that the violence is starting to take on islamist undertones ... judging by last year 's riots , you can not say that .
quite to the contrary , there were some representatives of muslim communities that became important contact people for the mayors because they were the only ones left that still had some influence over the teenagers .
in a powder keg , you can not rule out such a development .
but i do n't see this as a danger right now . ercin özlü interviewed henrik uterwedde -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new french film highlights roots of bias against north africans a recently released french film has sparked renewed debate over discrimination against north africans - and may have prompted president jacques chirac to redress an egregious imbalance .
-lrb- 01.10.2006 -rrb- chirac plans dismissed as france teeters on brink of anarchy trade unions and students were more determined than ever saturday to go ahead with strikes and demonstrations against a new youth jobs law despite a compromise plan by president jacques chirac aimed at defusing tensions .
-lrb- 01.04.2006 -rrb- rioting unlikely in germany , say experts france is facing the worst racial unrest in decades .
could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical .

dw-world.de talked to henrik uterwedde about reactions of the french government and the continuing social gap . henrik uterwedde is deputy director of the franco-german institute in ludwigsburg in southwestern german .
he teaches political science at stuttgart university . dw-world.de : friday is the one-year anniversary of the riots in the french suburbs .
cars were again set on fire in the last couple of days .
the police secret service warns about an escalation . henrik uterwedde : there were repeated clashes , including incidents , where police officers , who wanted to check people , were ambushed by teenaged gangs .
moral barriers against readiness for violence have been torn down .
and it 's hard to erect them again . are these assaults the first signs of a new wave of violence ? at least you can not rule that out .
there are signs that the climate in the suburbs remains explosive .
experts , such as one of the mayors in the area , say : " we 're sitting on a powder keg . "
that 's because the roots of the crisis have not been eradicated .
you can not do away with 30 years of crisis-like developments within 12 months . what are the causes for the teenagers ' frustration ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their future 's not looking too bright so far first of all , it 's a deep social crisis .
about 700 hot spot quarters exist in france 's metropolitan areas and almost 5 million people live there .
these areas are monocultures .
forty percent of youngsters who live there do n't have a high school diploma .
the unemployment rate is twice as high as in the rest of france .
there 's a conglomeration of all social problems the country is facing .
on top of that , you have an integration crisis .
teenagers from immigrant families are especially discriminated against when they 're looking for work .
it 's not enough to criminalize teenagers and employ a law and order policy to restore peace - as interior minister sarkozy has been doing in a very populist way . the government has announced several initiatives following the riots last year .
which political steps have been taken ? even before 2005 , useful programs existed that tried to diffuse hot spots of social conflict .
following the riots , there were four measures .
people tried to improve the chances of employment for the teenagers in metropolitan areas .
steps have been taken to combat ethnic discrimination .
another , very expensive , program is that of urban planning .
there 's a tremendous problem with the clusters of apartment towers .
a renovation project has been set up .
the fourth step deal with repression .
of course the state can not tolerate the creation of lawless areas .
but all of these measures will not lead to swift successes . do you think these are steps in the right direction ? yes , i think so .
the most visible results are the ones resulting from the renovation of living space .
all other initiatives will take longer .
employment , of course , is dependent on the economy , which is not doing that great at the moment .
failure in school is another big problem .
we know that the chances to find employment rise with success in school .
but a few extra teachers wo n't be enough to fight this problem . what 's happening to address the issue of discrimination against teenagers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik uterwedde you can outlaw discrimination .
but try to change the mentality of a small business owner , who has reservations about immigrants .
there are some cases of positive discrimination .
one of the biggest elite universities , the sciences po , the institute for political science in paris , has made a kind of contract with some selected high schools in hot spot areas .
it allows a certain contingent of students from these areas to study at the university . the police union has warned that the violence is starting to take on islamist undertones ... judging by last year 's riots , you can not say that .
quite to the contrary , there were some representatives of muslim communities that became important contact people for the mayors because they were the only ones left that still had some influence over the teenagers .
in a powder keg , you can not rule out such a development .
but i do n't see this as a danger right now . ercin özlü interviewed henrik uterwedde -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new french film highlights roots of bias against north africans a recently released french film has sparked renewed debate over discrimination against north africans - and may have prompted president jacques chirac to redress an egregious imbalance .

could the same happen in germany , home to a large immigrant population which has been spared violence so far ?
experts are skeptical .

the man himself spoke up friday and revealed that he was in informal talks with the us soccer federation . will he or wo n't he ?
that 's the question that is looking closer to being answered friday regarding the employment status of former germany national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann . ever since the tear-stained departure of the man known and loved as " klinsi " from the germany set-up , a nation 's thanks ringing in his ears and some carefully removed knives from his back returned to their rightful owners , rumors have been circulating that klinsmann could take over the us national team . these rumors , buffeted by counter-speculation that klinsi was considering the slightly more spicy allure of mexico a little further south of his california home , have gained some credibility after reports revealed that the former stuttgart , inter milan and tottenham striker is in informal talks with the us soccer federation -lrb- ussf -rrb- . casual and relaxed discussions words from the man himself about the meeting with ussf president sunil gulati hint at a possible deal in the making : " we 've had a couple of conversations .
i 'm evaluating everything that comes up , " said klinsmann in an interview with the associated press .
" i 'll stay in touch with sunil and see what it leads to .
it 's a very casual and relaxed correspondence . " " sooner or later , i have to get back into coaching , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann left a nation in rapture gulati , who has refused to comment on his talks with any potential replacement , repeated on thursday that he hopes to have a new coach in place by the end of the year . klinsmann resigned as germany coach three days after the world cup after leading germany to the semi-finals where they lost to eventual winners italy .
his german team kept the party going for one more game by beating portugal in the third place play-off before klinsi announced that he wanted to spend more time with his family in los angeles . us lifestyle a problem for dfb , not so for suitors klinsi clashed on a number of occasions with the hierarchy at the germany football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- over his refusal to move back to the country of his birth before the world cup .
instead , klinsmann chose to commute , stirring anger in many traditionalists in the game . such a problem would not exist if he were to take up the role as successor to incumbent us coach bruce arena , who was told by gulati in mid-july that his contract would not be renewed . klinsmann remains the preferred candidate of the ussf and is the favorite of many to take over when arena leaves the post at the end of the year .
klinsmann introduced a number of stateside training and management techniques to the german set-up , prompting much criticism before the tournament . coaching techniques suited for us style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi and jogi laid the foundations of a bright future a sports psychologist was employed , the team 's second kit was changed to the more positive color red and a number of non-sport related exercises were adopted to build concentration and togetherness .
discredited as new age hokum at the time , klinsi 's detractors were forced to eat large dollops of humble pie throughout june and july as his germany team rolled on . his techniques are now being utilized and advanced by his former assistant joachim löw , who now runs the team and ensures germany continues to build on the talented pool of youth at its disposal . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de klinsmann hints at return for next world cup germany soccer supporters were sad when national men 's head coach jürgen klinsmann took his hat after the world cup .

-lrb- 14.09.2006 -rrb- could klinsi put an end to the commute and stay in usa ?
after the usa crashed out the 2006 world cup , some see jürgen klinsmann as a natural replacement for bruce arena .

the scandal meanwhile widened as a tabloid said it would publish more photos saturday . defense minister franz josef jung said that the two men " will no longer be a part of the german army . "
four others , who had also been identified as having participated in taking the photographs , have since left the bundeswehr . german private tv channel rtl on thursday night showed pictures of a soldier kissing a skull that was lying on his shoulder and of another posing with a skull mounted on his patrol vehicle .
in a third photograph , several skulls are piled on top of each to form a pyramid . rtl officials said the pictures were taken with a digital camera and dated from march 2004 , making them roughly a year younger than the photographs of soldiers and skulls published in germany 's bild tabloid on wednesday .
they show soldiers posing with a skull mounted on a patrol vehicle bearing the german flag and the acronym isaf .
in one picture , a soldier in a camouflage uniform holds the skull next to his exposed penis . bild editors said they would publish further images saturday .
the images reportedly show a mock execution of a skeleton assembled from various human remains . the chief of staff of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , denied suggestions that the fact that a second set of pictures has come to light proved that such behavior was widespread among german troops . " it is another isolated case , " schneiderhan told rtl , but vowed that the soldiers involved would face a " merciless " inquiry .
state prosecutors have said they could face charges of disturbing the peace of the dead , which carries a prison sentence of up to three years . cemetery or pit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in afghanistan the bundeswehr said it appeared that the soldiers had found the skulls in a cemetery south of kabul .
but in an interview with bild , one of the soldiers involved in the incident said that soldiers found the bones during a patrol near a pit outside kabul . " it was where the afghans dug up the clay they needed to make bricks , " the unidentified soldier said .
" all these bones came out in the process .
it was not a cemetery , not a place of worship . " he said he was not forced to participate , but that people who refused to do so would have been called " wimps .

" i think that the inhibition threshold was low because of this . according to news reports , the location was well-known among soldiers stationed in afghanistan , who repeatedly came there to take photographs .
german opposition green party politician hans-christian ströbele said he had been told by at least half-a-dozen soldiers that there were hundreds of such photos in existence . german politicians and military officials have meanwhile called for a review of the bundeswehr 's training program to make sure that soldiers are well prepared for their missions . defense minister jung said a team of specialists would be traveling to afghanistan to assess conditions there .
he added that the bundeswehr would also review its training methods . afghan government condemns actions the afghan government meanwhile on friday " strongly condemned " friday the actions of german soldiers seen in photographs playing with human skulls in afghanistan and said their acts were against islamic values . the government called on " german authorities to investigate the matter , bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure such actions are not repeated , " the statement said . there has been little attention to the scandal in the afghan media , with most newspapers suspending publication over the eid holidays . insults to islam have sparked fierce reaction in conservative afghanistan .
an incident in which us soldiers in islamic afghanistan were captured on film burning the bodies of men said to be taliban fighters late last year caused outrage as it was disrespectful of the dead and against the tenets of islam . last year , the publication of danish cartoons deemed insulting of the prophet mohammad caused days of rioting across the country that left 11 people dead . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghan government " deeply saddened " by soldier scandal kabul has condemned photos published of german soldiers posing with a skull as being " against islamic values . "
the afghan trade minister said he fears effects similar to those in the wake of the mohammed cartoons .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : installed thermia heat pump the " rock " technology is adaptable - in countries with very little bedrock , like the netherlands , the tube for collecting heat is simply laid in the ground water , which also keeps a steady temperature .
the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .
according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .
and for bergsjoe , the advantages of the pump system are obvious .
" this is a very environmentally friendly heating system .. because 75 % of the energy used by heat pumps is solar energy .
so it 's clean , it 's energy efficient and very good for the environment . "
obstacles to " rock energy " the are some negatives to the heat pump , such as the relatively high initial installation cost .
the system is adapted for water-based heating systems , but many european houses rely on gas or electric heaters .
this means they would need extensive upgrading before a heat pump and rock energy technology can be installed .
this wasn ’ t a problem for nils raambin in uppsala because the apartment blocks there already had water-based heaters .
raambin can only speak well of " rock energy " .
and there was another positive side effect - the water fountain in the middle of the square comes from ground water hit during drilling . "

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions europe -pipe- 27.10.2006 heating with rocks , swedish style großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harsh swedish winters make heating expensive for decades , swedes have used the vestigial heat in the bedrock to heat their homes .
the technology , called " rock energy " , is much more efficient than traditional heating methods , and is virtually emissions free . nils raambin is a seventy-eight year old former building technician who refuses to retire .
he stands in a bustling square in uppsala in front of a new-looking housing block , proudly explaining that the 97 apartments , 12 shops and two supermarkets in the building all use " rock energy " .
before nils raambin got his hands on the building , it was a drab , run-of the-mill 1970s housing block .
the transformation of the renovated facades and the square is impressive .
and it 's all been done with the money saved on heating .
" we had money over to rebuild our balconies , and to cover an outside room with glass !
the owners did n't have to pay anything .
the heat pump paid , " said rambin with a laugh .
according the rambin , the heat pump and rock energy system installed in these blocks has halved the energy costs .
energy to spare the apartment owners also make extra money be selling their unused " rock " energy to the shops and cafes lining the square .
the energy is gained from holes dug 150 metres into the rock .
water runs down each hole in a tube , and at the bottom , absorbs a few degrees of heat from the bedrock , which is at a constant seven degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diagram of how a vertical " rock heat pump " works the water then flows back up the tubes and into the houses , where it is heated further in a heating pump .
the energy absorbed is enough to provide radiator heat and hot water .
the key here is the few degrees picked up down in the bedrock .
although the geothermic heating system itself needs some electricity to run , it gets more energy back than is put in , because of the free energy picked up in the bedrock the swedish firm thermia , based in uppsala , is one of the largest producers of the heat pumps that are needed to source this energy .
hundreds of kilometres north-west of uppsala is another thermia installation .
anders delarose 's villa lies in a part of sweden that gets extremely cold in the winter - temperatures here sometimes fall below minus thirty degrees .
still , the heat pump system keeps delarose , his family and his dog warm .
and it saves them money .
" before i had a direct heater , and spent 26000 kilo watts , and now we ’ re down to 14000 kilo watts .
so it ’ s very good , " delarose said .
heating online thermia has been in the heating business for more than a hundred years .
in 1889 it produced wood stoves , and moved on to producing hot water tanks and boilers in 1923 .
fifty years later , in 1973 , they developed sweden 's first modern heat pump .
and in 2000 , they introduced an online control mechanism .
so anyone with a thermia system in their home , can now control it using the internet .
today , thermia 's annual turn-over is sixty-seven million dollars and they employ 265 people .
for thermia , the world ’ s precarious energy situation is nothing but good news .
" high oil prices are the best thing that has happened to us , " said sten lilienau , head of marketing at thermia ’ s arvika factory .
" and also the co2 targets in the kyoto agreement .
so those are the two biggest drives for heat pumps in europe . "
pump sales booming sales of the heat pump in sweden have grown between 15-20 percent in the last year , and thermia 's factory in arvika is running at full speed , to keep up with demand from other european countries .

the technology is fully established in sweden , where two thirds of every new or renovated home has heat pumps .
now , thermia hopes to take the heat pumps to the rest of europe .
according to thermia ’ s senior vice president , mats bergsjoe , the pumps are not only good for heating and hot water , but can also be adapted for cooling .

the scandal meanwhile widened as a tabloid said it would publish more photos saturday . defense minister franz josef jung said that the two men " will no longer be a part of the german army . "
four others , who had also been identified as having participated in taking the photographs , have since left the bundeswehr . german private tv channel rtl on thursday night showed pictures of a soldier kissing a skull that was lying on his shoulder and of another posing with a skull mounted on his patrol vehicle .
in a third photograph , several skulls are piled on top of each to form a pyramid . rtl officials said the pictures were taken with a digital camera and dated from march 2004 , making them roughly a year younger than the photographs of soldiers and skulls published in germany 's bild tabloid on wednesday .
they show soldiers posing with a skull mounted on a patrol vehicle bearing the german flag and the acronym isaf .
in one picture , a soldier in a camouflage uniform holds the skull next to his exposed penis . bild editors said they would publish further images saturday .
the images reportedly show a mock execution of a skeleton assembled from various human remains . the chief of staff of the bundeswehr , wolfgang schneiderhan , denied suggestions that the fact that a second set of pictures has come to light proved that such behavior was widespread among german troops . " it is another isolated case , " schneiderhan told rtl , but vowed that the soldiers involved would face a " merciless " inquiry .
state prosecutors have said they could face charges of disturbing the peace of the dead , which carries a prison sentence of up to three years . cemetery or pit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier on patrol in afghanistan the bundeswehr said it appeared that the soldiers had found the skulls in a cemetery south of kabul .
but in an interview with bild , one of the soldiers involved in the incident said that soldiers found the bones during a patrol near a pit outside kabul . " it was where the afghans dug up the clay they needed to make bricks , " the unidentified soldier said .
" all these bones came out in the process .
it was not a cemetery , not a place of worship . " he said he was not forced to participate , but that people who refused to do so would have been called " wimps . " low inhibition threshold the man said that he should not have participated in the incident , but added that he and his comrades were tense at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an isaf ambulance near a place where german soldiers were killed in 2003 " it 's hard on the nerves when you 're constantly confronted with people from your own army or the allies getting hurt or die , " he said .
" i think that the inhibition threshold was low because of this . according to news reports , the location was well-known among soldiers stationed in afghanistan , who repeatedly came there to take photographs .
german opposition green party politician hans-christian ströbele said he had been told by at least half-a-dozen soldiers that there were hundreds of such photos in existence . german politicians and military officials have meanwhile called for a review of the bundeswehr 's training program to make sure that soldiers are well prepared for their missions . defense minister jung said a team of specialists would be traveling to afghanistan to assess conditions there .
he added that the bundeswehr would also review its training methods . afghan government condemns actions the afghan government meanwhile on friday " strongly condemned " friday the actions of german soldiers seen in photographs playing with human skulls in afghanistan and said their acts were against islamic values . the government called on " german authorities to investigate the matter , bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure such actions are not repeated , " the statement said . there has been little attention to the scandal in the afghan media , with most newspapers suspending publication over the eid holidays . insults to islam have sparked fierce reaction in conservative afghanistan .
an incident in which us soldiers in islamic afghanistan were captured on film burning the bodies of men said to be taliban fighters late last year caused outrage as it was disrespectful of the dead and against the tenets of islam . last year , the publication of danish cartoons deemed insulting of the prophet mohammad caused days of rioting across the country that left 11 people dead . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de afghan government " deeply saddened " by soldier scandal kabul has condemned photos published of german soldiers posing with a skull as being " against islamic values .

but it did n't used to be that way .
for a long time , it was heavily polluted . people used to gravitate toward the rhine river for all sorts of play - even swimming despite the dangerous currents .
legend has it that in winter , part of the rhine used to freeze over , and people would walk across the mighty waterway . the river begins in switzerland .
passing through the city of basel , it forms the border between germany and france , flows into germany and the netherlands and ends in the north sea . but in the wake of an environmental disaster 20 years ago in switzerland , many stayed away from the water , with experts wondering if it would ever be clean again .
at a recent press conference , an international commission said the rhine is a " living " river once more . polluted with pesticides in 1986 , a fire broke out in a production plant storage room at the pharmaceutical company sandoz in the swiss city of basel .
as a result , huge amounts of pesticides were released into the upper rhine , killing a multitude of fish and micro-organisms . the accident turned the river into europe 's biggest sewer . fritz holzwarth , head of the bonn-based international commission for the protection of the rhine , said that it was this catastrophe that triggered concern about the river 's health . " we can say that the sandoz incident was basically the worst possible scenario at the time so it contributed a great deal to making the protection of water an important issue in politics , " he said . a huge task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairy-tale beauty along the waterway 's twists and turns it would take a lot of effort before the river could be transformed into a place where people could swim again .
ultimately , it was pressure from an outraged public that forced politicians to take fast action . since then , investments in industrial and public water purification plants have amounted to 60 billion euros -lrb- over $ 75 billion -rrb- , with local governments investing a yearly amount of one billion euros in water purification . the risk of another dramatic accident has been minimized since the companies located along the rhine have taken precautions , holzwarth said , adding that a pro-active approach is necessary to keep the river clean . " the international commission for the protection of the rhine , together with those who live near the river 's banks , want to advance a perspective that allows people to live with and enjoy the river , " he said .
" we want to include the river in our lives and in those of our children , " he added . to that end , a 320-kilometer-long -lrb- nearly 200-mile -rrb- hiking trail called the rheinsteig was recently completed between bonn and koblenz . in addition , the rhine , europe 's most densely populated river , is a unesco world heritage site .

the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy proposed that a common immigration policy should be created for the european union at an informal meeting thursday in stratford-upon-avon , england .

in 1972 , the number of migrants worldwide was 82 million . the report estimated that migrants sent $ 150 billion -lrb- 118 billion euros -rrb- to their families in their home countries in 2004 and that in many countries , without foreign workers , entire economic sectors would collapse . eu adoption british , italian and spanish polish interior ministers approved the proposal , which would have to be expanded and streamlined with a view to being adopted by the eu council of ministers at the eu summit in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu immigration control schäuble and sarkozy had also proposed that national immigration quotas be registered with brussels , which would enable the eu to repatriate illegal immigrants to their countries of origin more easily .

as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods . germany scrambled friday to limit the damage stemming from the publication of photographs of some of its servicemen in macabre and sometimes obscene poses with a human skull and skeleton in afghanistan . the images , one of which showed a skull next to a soldier 's exposed penis and first splashed across the mass-selling bild tabloid this week , have sparked disbelief and outrage in the country as well as fears of protests in the muslim world . german politicians have unanimously condemned the incidents and an official inquiry has already led to the suspension of two soldiers . " i 'm devastated and also worried , both about the abuse of islamic values as well as the yet unforeseeable consequences of these incidents , " said winfried nachtwei , defense policy spokesman of the opposition green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of german troops in afghanistan are involved in reconstruction work though defense experts have been at pains to point out that the incidents are isolated and that the entire 2,800-strong contingent of german peacekeepers in afghanistan should n't be tarred with the same brush , many are calling for a review of army training programs and the preparedness of german soldiers participating in overseas missions . the scandal coincides with the presentation to lawmakers this week of a new long-term national security policy , which predicts an increasingly important role for the armed forces abroad . training in cultural sensibilities " we have to ask whether the training that soldiers undergo is sufficient , " reinhold robbe , a social democrat parliamentarian and designated defense commissioner for the german parliament told broadcaster zdf . " though the soldiers are trained very well in defense tactics , we have to equip them with more intercultural sensibilities and moral values , " he said . thomas ruttig , an expert on afghanistan at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , said that military training for soldiers being sent to afghanistan did involve familiarizing them with the country 's traditions and cultural sensibilities . " soldiers usually are briefed by all kinds of experts and institutions on developing understanding and tolerance for other religions and supplied with all kinds of material and manuals on the region , " ruttig said .
" but of course there 's no guarantee they will read what 's handed out or that they 're not sleeping in class . " not a one-off case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians called for increased cultural training for soldiers before they are deployed revelations of further photographs and media reports that a field of bones near kabul was used by international peacekeepers several times to stage grisly photo shoots , have however raised questions over whether such incidents may be more frequent than is claimed otherwise . " we have to finally stop talking about all this being a one-off thing and pure coincidence , " said helmuth prieß , chairman of the darmstadt-based " working group of critical soldiers . " he pointed out that the bundeswehr has been rocked by a series of scandals within germany in recent years .
in june this year , a german newspaper reported that new recruits with a paratrooper squadron in the state of rheinland-palatinate were subjected to humiliating initiation rituals including stripping naked and being slapped with paddles .

as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods . germany scrambled friday to limit the damage stemming from the publication of photographs of some of its servicemen in macabre and sometimes obscene poses with a human skull and skeleton in afghanistan . the images , one of which showed a skull next to a soldier 's exposed penis and first splashed across the mass-selling bild tabloid this week , have sparked disbelief and outrage in the country as well as fears of protests in the muslim world . german politicians have unanimously condemned the incidents and an official inquiry has already led to the suspension of two soldiers . " i 'm devastated and also worried , both about the abuse of islamic values as well as the yet unforeseeable consequences of these incidents , " said winfried nachtwei , defense policy spokesman of the opposition green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of german troops in afghanistan are involved in reconstruction work though defense experts have been at pains to point out that the incidents are isolated and that the entire 2,800-strong contingent of german peacekeepers in afghanistan should n't be tarred with the same brush , many are calling for a review of army training programs and the preparedness of german soldiers participating in overseas missions . the scandal coincides with the presentation to lawmakers this week of a new long-term national security policy , which predicts an increasingly important role for the armed forces abroad . training in cultural sensibilities " we have to ask whether the training that soldiers undergo is sufficient , " reinhold robbe , a social democrat parliamentarian and designated defense commissioner for the german parliament told broadcaster zdf . " though the soldiers are trained very well in defense tactics , we have to equip them with more intercultural sensibilities and moral values , " he said . thomas ruttig , an expert on afghanistan at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , said that military training for soldiers being sent to afghanistan did involve familiarizing them with the country 's traditions and cultural sensibilities . " soldiers usually are briefed by all kinds of experts and institutions on developing understanding and tolerance for other religions and supplied with all kinds of material and manuals on the region , " ruttig said .
" but of course there 's no guarantee they will read what 's handed out or that they 're not sleeping in class . " not a one-off case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians called for increased cultural training for soldiers before they are deployed revelations of further photographs and media reports that a field of bones near kabul was used by international peacekeepers several times to stage grisly photo shoots , have however raised questions over whether such incidents may be more frequent than is claimed otherwise . " we have to finally stop talking about all this being a one-off thing and pure coincidence , " said helmuth prieß , chairman of the darmstadt-based " working group of critical soldiers . " he pointed out that the bundeswehr has been rocked by a series of scandals within germany in recent years .
in june this year , a german newspaper reported that new recruits with a paratrooper squadron in the state of rheinland-palatinate were subjected to humiliating initiation rituals including stripping naked and being slapped with paddles . " we only hear a part of these incidents when they make it out into the open , but the real problem is much bigger , " said prieß , a former lieutenant . " being a soldier changes a person .
walking around with a loaded weapon in a foreign country , far away from everything that 's familiar and bound within group dynamics , does lead to brutalization and a loss of inhibitions , " he said . on friday , the bild newspaper published an interview with a man it said belonged to the army patrol responsible for the initial photos .

it has been reluctant for the state to acquire the stake directly , preferring instead a private-sector solution . complex deal wirtschaftswoche noted that daimlerchrysler does not hold the stake directly , but via a non-operative subsidiary , dasa .
dasa 's share capital is held by daimlerchrysler , the city state authorities of hamburg , the dornier family and the messerschmitt foundation . under the complex deal , dasa would issue a convertible bond with a value of up to 49 percent of its enterprise value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads susidiary airbus is hurting , but has gotten some big orders recently the bond , which would be convertible into the eads shares , would be bought by a privately led investor consortium that included a number of public-sector regional state banks and the state-owned kfw redevelopment bank , wirtschaftswoche reported . dasa would use the money from the bond issue to reimburse its shareholders , enabling daimlerchrysler to pocket more money than it would raise from the sale of its shares via the open stock market , the magazine said . at the same time , daimlerchrysler would hold on to its eads voting rights until the bond came up for redemption .
such a construction would also help to fend off potential predators , the magazine said . chancellor angela merkel was scheduled to talk over the solution with the french and german eads co-chairmen , louis gallois and thomas enders , at a meeting in berlin in the next few days , wirtschaftswoche added . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus wins big in china with order for 150 jets , new plant troubled airplane manufacturer airbus got some good news finally .

it has been reluctant for the state to acquire the stake directly , preferring instead a private-sector solution . complex deal wirtschaftswoche noted that daimlerchrysler does not hold the stake directly , but via a non-operative subsidiary , dasa .
dasa 's share capital is held by daimlerchrysler , the city state authorities of hamburg , the dornier family and the messerschmitt foundation . under the complex deal , dasa would issue a convertible bond with a value of up to 49 percent of its enterprise value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads susidiary airbus is hurting , but has gotten some big orders recently the bond , which would be convertible into the eads shares , would be bought by a privately led investor consortium that included a number of public-sector regional state banks and the state-owned kfw redevelopment bank , wirtschaftswoche reported . dasa would use the money from the bond issue to reimburse its shareholders , enabling daimlerchrysler to pocket more money than it would raise from the sale of its shares via the open stock market , the magazine said . at the same time , daimlerchrysler would hold on to its eads voting rights until the bond came up for redemption .
such a construction would also help to fend off potential predators , the magazine said . chancellor angela merkel was scheduled to talk over the solution with the french and german eads co-chairmen , louis gallois and thomas enders , at a meeting in berlin in the next few days , wirtschaftswoche added . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus wins big in china with order for 150 jets , new plant troubled airplane manufacturer airbus got some good news finally .

as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods . germany scrambled friday to limit the damage stemming from the publication of photographs of some of its servicemen in macabre and sometimes obscene poses with a human skull and skeleton in afghanistan . the images , one of which showed a skull next to a soldier 's exposed penis and first splashed across the mass-selling bild tabloid this week , have sparked disbelief and outrage in the country as well as fears of protests in the muslim world . german politicians have unanimously condemned the incidents and an official inquiry has already led to the suspension of two soldiers .

as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods . germany scrambled friday to limit the damage stemming from the publication of photographs of some of its servicemen in macabre and sometimes obscene poses with a human skull and skeleton in afghanistan . the images , one of which showed a skull next to a soldier 's exposed penis and first splashed across the mass-selling bild tabloid this week , have sparked disbelief and outrage in the country as well as fears of protests in the muslim world . german politicians have unanimously condemned the incidents and an official inquiry has already led to the suspension of two soldiers . " i 'm devastated and also worried , both about the abuse of islamic values as well as the yet unforeseeable consequences of these incidents , " said winfried nachtwei , defense policy spokesman of the opposition green party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of german troops in afghanistan are involved in reconstruction work though defense experts have been at pains to point out that the incidents are isolated and that the entire 2,800-strong contingent of german peacekeepers in afghanistan should n't be tarred with the same brush , many are calling for a review of army training programs and the preparedness of german soldiers participating in overseas missions . the scandal coincides with the presentation to lawmakers this week of a new long-term national security policy , which predicts an increasingly important role for the armed forces abroad . training in cultural sensibilities " we have to ask whether the training that soldiers undergo is sufficient , " reinhold robbe , a social democrat parliamentarian and designated defense commissioner for the german parliament told broadcaster zdf . " though the soldiers are trained very well in defense tactics , we have to equip them with more intercultural sensibilities and moral values , " he said . thomas ruttig , an expert on afghanistan at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs , said that military training for soldiers being sent to afghanistan did involve familiarizing them with the country 's traditions and cultural sensibilities . " soldiers usually are briefed by all kinds of experts and institutions on developing understanding and tolerance for other religions and supplied with all kinds of material and manuals on the region , " ruttig said .

" we have to finally stop talking about all this being a one-off thing and pure coincidence , " said helmuth prieß , chairman of the darmstadt-based " working group of critical soldiers . " he pointed out that the bundeswehr has been rocked by a series of scandals within germany in recent years .
in june this year , a german newspaper reported that new recruits with a paratrooper squadron in the state of rheinland-palatinate were subjected to humiliating initiation rituals including stripping naked and being slapped with paddles . " we only hear a part of these incidents when they make it out into the open , but the real problem is much bigger , " said prieß , a former lieutenant . " being a soldier changes a person .
walking around with a loaded weapon in a foreign country , far away from everything that 's familiar and bound within group dynamics , does lead to brutalization and a loss of inhibitions , " he said . on friday , the bild newspaper published an interview with a man it said belonged to the army patrol responsible for the initial photos .

at present , more than 9,000 german soldiers are deployed in peacekeeping missions around the world . " the thing with foreign deployments is that even a low-level soldier faces increased demands .
it 's a high-stress job , " said nachtwei .
" within one minute , he has to be capable of dialogue and reaching out to the local populace as well as ready to fight and repulse an attack .
that 's a challenge that practically does n't exist in any other profession . " " a hero is someone who opens his mouth " others point out that the bundeswehr has to also offer better pay packages in order to attract the right talent as well as take steps to encourage soldiers to report any wrongdoing they witness . the army needs to screen its candidates rigorously with the help of experienced independent and critical psychologists and doctors and make an effort to instill moral and ethical values in its recruits , said prieß .

it has been reluctant for the state to acquire the stake directly , preferring instead a private-sector solution . complex deal wirtschaftswoche noted that daimlerchrysler does not hold the stake directly , but via a non-operative subsidiary , dasa .
dasa 's share capital is held by daimlerchrysler , the city state authorities of hamburg , the dornier family and the messerschmitt foundation . under the complex deal , dasa would issue a convertible bond with a value of up to 49 percent of its enterprise value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads susidiary airbus is hurting , but has gotten some big orders recently the bond , which would be convertible into the eads shares , would be bought by a privately led investor consortium that included a number of public-sector regional state banks and the state-owned kfw redevelopment bank , wirtschaftswoche reported . dasa would use the money from the bond issue to reimburse its shareholders , enabling daimlerchrysler to pocket more money than it would raise from the sale of its shares via the open stock market , the magazine said . at the same time , daimlerchrysler would hold on to its eads voting rights until the bond came up for redemption .
such a construction would also help to fend off potential predators , the magazine said . chancellor angela merkel was scheduled to talk over the solution with the french and german eads co-chairmen , louis gallois and thomas enders , at a meeting in berlin in the next few days , wirtschaftswoche added . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus wins big in china with order for 150 jets , new plant troubled airplane manufacturer airbus got some good news finally .

as the scandal over photographs of german soldiers desecrating a human skull in afghanistan widens , experts in germany are calling for a review of the army 's training methods . germany scrambled friday to limit the damage stemming from the publication of photographs of some of its servicemen in macabre and sometimes obscene poses with a human skull and skeleton in afghanistan . the images , one of which showed a skull next to a soldier 's exposed penis and first splashed across the mass-selling bild tabloid this week , have sparked disbelief and outrage in the country as well as fears of protests in the muslim world . german politicians have unanimously condemned the incidents and an official inquiry has already led to the suspension of two soldiers .

" not a one-off case ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians called for increased cultural training for soldiers before they are deployed revelations of further photographs and media reports that a field of bones near kabul was used by international peacekeepers several times to stage grisly photo shoots , have however raised questions over whether such incidents may be more frequent than is claimed otherwise . " we have to finally stop talking about all this being a one-off thing and pure coincidence , " said helmuth prieß , chairman of the darmstadt-based " working group of critical soldiers . " he pointed out that the bundeswehr has been rocked by a series of scandals within germany in recent years .
in june this year , a german newspaper reported that new recruits with a paratrooper squadron in the state of rheinland-palatinate were subjected to humiliating initiation rituals including stripping naked and being slapped with paddles . " we only hear a part of these incidents when they make it out into the open , but the real problem is much bigger , " said prieß , a former lieutenant . " being a soldier changes a person .
walking around with a loaded weapon in a foreign country , far away from everything that 's familiar and bound within group dynamics , does lead to brutalization and a loss of inhibitions , " he said . on friday , the bild newspaper published an interview with a man it said belonged to the army patrol responsible for the initial photos .
the witness was quoted as saying that macho culture and poor morale were to blame for the incidents in afghanistan . changing role , increasing demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr is increasingly heading off to peackeeping missions overseas many experts agreed that part of the problem also lies in the changing role of the bundeswehr - away from being designed to protect germany from foreign armies to one actively and increasingly participating in peacekeeping missions in the world 's hottest spots .
at present , more than 9,000 german soldiers are deployed in peacekeeping missions around the world . " the thing with foreign deployments is that even a low-level soldier faces increased demands .
it 's a high-stress job , " said nachtwei .
" within one minute , he has to be capable of dialogue and reaching out to the local populace as well as ready to fight and repulse an attack .
that 's a challenge that practically does n't exist in any other profession . " " a hero is someone who opens his mouth " others point out that the bundeswehr has to also offer better pay packages in order to attract the right talent as well as take steps to encourage soldiers to report any wrongdoing they witness . the army needs to screen its candidates rigorously with the help of experienced independent and critical psychologists and doctors and make an effort to instill moral and ethical values in its recruits , said prieß . " it has to be made clear to the soldiers that a hero is n't someone who keeps his mouth shut , but rather someone who opens it to protest against inhuman acts .

the plan would allow migrants from non-eu country to work in the eu for a limited time . german interior minister wolfgang schäuble and his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy proposed that a common immigration policy should be created for the european union at an informal meeting thursday in stratford-upon-avon , england .
the proposal aims to create an eu asylum authority and open up the eu 's labor market to temporary guest workers . under the proposal , workers from poor countries could live in eu countries for three to four years , transfer money to their home countries and return with newly acquired skills , schäuble said . the idea of such " circular migration " originates with the united nations and aims to combine migration with development policy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new plan aims to curb illegal migration to the eu at the end of last year , a report by the global commission on international migration found the number of migrants around the world had risen to 200 million .
the report counted people who lived in a foreign country for more than one year and included 9.2 million refugees .
in 1972 , the number of migrants worldwide was 82 million . the report estimated that migrants sent $ 150 billion -lrb- 118 billion euros -rrb- to their families in their home countries in 2004 and that in many countries , without foreign workers , entire economic sectors would collapse . eu adoption british , italian and spanish polish interior ministers approved the proposal , which would have to be expanded and streamlined with a view to being adopted by the eu council of ministers at the eu summit in december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu immigration control schäuble and sarkozy had also proposed that national immigration quotas be registered with brussels , which would enable the eu to repatriate illegal immigrants to their countries of origin more easily . " there are voices around this table from the right and from the left who are united in seeing the subject of immigration not as a thing of politics but of human drama , " sarkozy said . german skepticism german politicians , however , expressed skepticism about the " circular migration " idea .
the internal affairs spokesperson for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , dieter wiefelspütz , told the berliner zeitung daily that current rules were sufficient . " i ca n't see any need for temporary guest workers , " he said , referring to germany 's 4 million unemployed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has seen an increase in illegal immigrants from sub-saharan africa the spokesperson for migration issues from the free-market liberal fdp party , sibylle laurischk , called the suggestion " naïve . " " evidently , they 've forgotten the lessons from the 1960 's , " she told the paper , referring to a period then germany brought many turkish guest workers into the country .
many of them stayed despite the government 's intention that they would return home after several years of work . the interior ministers of britain , germany , france , spain , italy and poland were taking part in the two-day meeting , which began wednesday with discussions on a joint policy to combat terrorism .
this so-called g6 was set up by britain and france in 2003 to provide an informal way for big eu countries to discuss issues of law and order and immigration . interior ministers also pledged to share more information about future terrorist threats and to fight eu value-added-tax fraud . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : g6 ministers debate terrorism behind closed doors key european union ministers met in england on wednesday for talks on terrorism , illegal immigration and organized crime that critics fear will set an eu-wide security policy in virtual secrecy .

but it did n't used to be that way .
for a long time , it was heavily polluted . people used to gravitate toward the rhine river for all sorts of play - even swimming despite the dangerous currents .
legend has it that in winter , part of the rhine used to freeze over , and people would walk across the mighty waterway . the river begins in switzerland .
passing through the city of basel , it forms the border between germany and france , flows into germany and the netherlands and ends in the north sea . but in the wake of an environmental disaster 20 years ago in switzerland , many stayed away from the water , with experts wondering if it would ever be clean again .
at a recent press conference , an international commission said the rhine is a " living " river once more . polluted with pesticides in 1986 , a fire broke out in a production plant storage room at the pharmaceutical company sandoz in the swiss city of basel .
as a result , huge amounts of pesticides were released into the upper rhine , killing a multitude of fish and micro-organisms . the accident turned the river into europe 's biggest sewer . fritz holzwarth , head of the bonn-based international commission for the protection of the rhine , said that it was this catastrophe that triggered concern about the river 's health . " we can say that the sandoz incident was basically the worst possible scenario at the time so it contributed a great deal to making the protection of water an important issue in politics , " he said . a huge task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fairy-tale beauty along the waterway 's twists and turns it would take a lot of effort before the river could be transformed into a place where people could swim again .
ultimately , it was pressure from an outraged public that forced politicians to take fast action . since then , investments in industrial and public water purification plants have amounted to 60 billion euros -lrb- over $ 75 billion -rrb- , with local governments investing a yearly amount of one billion euros in water purification . the risk of another dramatic accident has been minimized since the companies located along the rhine have taken precautions , holzwarth said , adding that a pro-active approach is necessary to keep the river clean . " the international commission for the protection of the rhine , together with those who live near the river 's banks , want to advance a perspective that allows people to live with and enjoy the river , " he said .
" we want to include the river in our lives and in those of our children , " he added . to that end , a 320-kilometer-long -lrb- nearly 200-mile -rrb- hiking trail called the rheinsteig was recently completed between bonn and koblenz . in addition , the rhine , europe 's most densely populated river , is a unesco world heritage site .

lionel " buster " crabb disappeared while spying on the ordzhonikidze - which had brought the soviet leader to britain for talks - in portsmouth harbour .
papers released at the national archives set out his last known hours .
the admiralty documents make clear that whoever sent him on his mission , it was not the royal navy .
' negligence ' fear the russian ship had brought the soviet leader nikita khrushchev for meetings with the british prime minister anthony eden and his ministers .
the newly-released documents show that an officer , who is still unidentified , took crabb out in a small boat in portsmouth docks and stayed onboard as the diver disappeared below the surface . "
the moment it became clear that a mishap had occurred -lrb- name blanked out -rrb- was ordered to return to his ship and take no further part in the affair " admiral inglis the second time crabb did not come back , and several months later a headless corpse , identified by a friend as crabb , was found floating along the coast .
at the time crabb went missing , the navy tried to say he was feared drowned in stokes bay - another location altogether .
the incident wrecked attempts at a rapprochement between britain and the post-stalin government in moscow .
the russians protested they were being spied upon by their hosts and , in the commons , the government was asked if the security services were out of control .
the papers make clear that the royal navy was embarrassed and appalled by the affair .
it was concerned the anonymous officer would have to tell a story at a subsequent inquest " inconsistent with the impression which we have tried to convey - that this was a naval operation " . "
i want the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth " lomond handley crabb 's relative a memo from rear admiral jgt inglis , director of naval intelligence , on 21 june , explained that in a " bona fide " operation , there would have been " immediate and extensive rescue operations " .
and the unnamed diving officer would have also taken action .
in fact , there was no rescue operation because " a search could not be carried out beside the russian warships " .
adm inglis pointed out that , instead , " the moment it became clear that a mishap had occurred -lrb- name blanked out -rrb- was ordered to return to his ship and take no further part in the affair " .
this could expose naval chiefs and the unidentified officer who accompanied crabb , to charges of " negligence , lack of humanity and error of judgment " , he feared .
' strictly private ' the secret account of the anonymous officer who assisted crabb on the day of his disappearance , was also made public for the first time . "
his actions until disappearance under the surface were normal , and the conditions for diving were good .
he was not seen by me again " anonymous officer accompanying crabb he said he had been asked to assist him " entirely unofficially and in a strictly private capacity " .
the officer said : " he carried sufficient oxygen for an absence of a maximum of two hours submerged .
" his actions until disappearance under the surface were normal , and the conditions for diving were good .
he was not seen by me again . "
' embarrassing questions ' navy officials were keen for this officer not to appear in public at a subsequent inquest .
it was decided to dispatch a temporary clerical officer to represent the admiralty instead .
one of the secret documents explained : " he knows nothing of the background to the story and will not be able to answer any embarrassing questions even if they are asked . "
the same document said : " the coroner is aware of the background to the case and is not asking for the appearance of any embarrassing naval witnesses . "
the coroner ruled that it was crabb 's body that had been found .
freedom of information howard davies , archivist at the national archives , said the extent of the cover-up suggested there was more about the case to be told .
and crabb 's family demanded the truth .
lomond handley , from poole in dorset , one of his few living relatives , said : " the people deserve to know what happened to a man who had served his country honourably and with integrity . "
the latest revelations come just four months after bbc radio solent obtained a report into crabb 's mission with a freedom of information application .
the report showed that crabb 's intelligence service handlers did not take proper precautions to protect him or the secrecy of the mission .

lionel " buster " crabb disappeared while spying on the ordzhonikidze - which had brought the soviet leader to britain for talks - in portsmouth harbour .
papers released at the national archives set out his last known hours .
the admiralty documents make clear that whoever sent him on his mission , it was not the royal navy .
' negligence ' fear the russian ship had brought the soviet leader nikita khrushchev for meetings with the british prime minister anthony eden and his ministers .
the newly-released documents show that an officer , who is still unidentified , took crabb out in a small boat in portsmouth docks and stayed onboard as the diver disappeared below the surface .
the moment it became clear that a mishap had occurred -lrb- name blanked out -rrb- was ordered to return to his ship and take no further part in the affair admiral inglis the second time crabb did not come back , and several months later a headless corpse , identified by a friend as crabb , was found floating along the coast .
at the time crabb went missing , the navy tried to say he was feared drowned in stokes bay - another location altogether .
the incident wrecked attempts at a rapprochement between britain and the post-stalin government in moscow .
the russians protested they were being spied upon by their hosts and , in the commons , the government was asked if the security services were out of control .
the papers make clear that the royal navy was embarrassed and appalled by the affair .

mexican president-elect felipe calderon said the fence was " a grave mistake " which would lead to more mexican deaths on the border .
george w bush said the new barrier was needed to curtail illegal immigration .
correspondents say the republican party hopes the move will secure votes in next month 's mid-term elections .
about 11 million mexicans are thought to live in the us , more than six million of them illegally .
an estimated 1.2 million illegal immigrants were arrested last year trying to cross into the us via the border states of texas , new mexico , arizona and california .
ours is a nation of immigrants - we 're also a nation of law president bush republican split q & a : us immigration debate mr calderon said he deplored the move because " the fence does n't resolve anything " .
" humanity committed a grave mistake in building the berlin wall , " he said .
" i 'm sure that the united states is committing a grave mistake in building this fence . "
outgoing mexican president vicente fox called the plans " shameful " .
mexico has pledged to challenge the fence at the united nations , having already appealed to the organisation of american states .
' nation of immigrants ' in signing the secure fence act 2006 into law , mr bush said his government would tackle illegal immigration by means of increased funding and numbers of immigration officials .
more than a million illegals were arrested on the border last year he said that remote cameras , satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles would also be used to create a " 21st-century " border with mexico .
" ours is a nation of immigrants - we 're also a nation of law , " mr bush said .
" unfortunately the united states has not been in complete control of its borders for decades .
therefore illegal immigration has been on the rise . "
however , he promised to balance the border plans with a temporary guest-worker programme and moves to grant citizenship to some of the illegal immigrants already in the us .
those moves are opposed by many within his own republican party .
' not impenetrable ' the bbc 's nick miles in washington says that many there query how effective the fence will be .
tj bonner , president of the national border patrol council , a union representing patrol agents , told the associated press that it would not be enough on its own : " a fence will slow people down by a minute or two , but if you do n't have the agents to stop them it does no good .
we 're not talking about some impenetrable barrier . "
the bbc 's duncan kennedy in mexico city says opposition to the fence has united mexican politicians .
they accuse the us of hypocrisy for enjoying the benefits of cheap mexican labour but not being prepared to offer mexican people a chance to cross the border legally .

mexican president-elect felipe calderon said the fence was " a grave mistake " which would lead to more mexican deaths on the border .
george w bush said the new barrier was needed to curtail illegal immigration .
correspondents say the republican party hopes the move will secure votes in next month 's mid-term elections .
about 11 million mexicans are thought to live in the us , more than six million of them illegally .
an estimated 1.2 million illegal immigrants were arrested last year trying to cross into the us via the border states of texas , new mexico , arizona and california . "
ours is a nation of immigrants - we 're also a nation of law " president bush republican split q & a : us immigration debate mr calderon said he deplored the move because " the fence does n't resolve anything " .
" humanity committed a grave mistake in building the berlin wall , " he said .
" i 'm sure that the united states is committing a grave mistake in building this fence . "
outgoing mexican president vicente fox called the plans " shameful " .
mexico has pledged to challenge the fence at the united nations , having already appealed to the organisation of american states .
' nation of immigrants ' in signing the secure fence act 2006 into law , mr bush said his government would tackle illegal immigration by means of increased funding and numbers of immigration officials .
he said that remote cameras , satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles would also be used to create a " 21st-century " border with mexico .
" ours is a nation of immigrants - we 're also a nation of law , " mr bush said .
" unfortunately the united states has not been in complete control of its borders for decades .
therefore illegal immigration has been on the rise . "
however , he promised to balance the border plans with a temporary guest-worker programme and moves to grant citizenship to some of the illegal immigrants already in the us .
those moves are opposed by many within his own republican party .
' not impenetrable ' the bbc 's nick miles in washington says that many there query how effective the fence will be .
tj bonner , president of the national border patrol council , a union representing patrol agents , told the associated press that it would not be enough on its own : " a fence will slow people down by a minute or two , but if you do n't have the agents to stop them it does no good .
we 're not talking about some impenetrable barrier . "
the bbc 's duncan kennedy in mexico city says opposition to the fence has united mexican politicians .
they accuse the us of hypocrisy for enjoying the benefits of cheap mexican labour but not being prepared to offer mexican people a chance to cross the border legally .

kevin lamb will join the garden from at bristol , a £ 97m science and nature centre on the city 's harbour side .
three years ago , the £ 43m attraction in carmarthenshire was within hours of having to call in administrators .
a plan based on better marketing and extra visitor activities has started the turn around in its fortunes .
mr lamb will take over from the garden 's interim chief executive roy thomas , who is credited by the garden 's trustees with improving the garden 's prospects .
chairman robin lewis said : " there are two key factors that face us and most visitor attractions - there is the number of people who come in through the door and there is how much they spend once they have come in . "
every institution of this type has to be a visitor attraction - no matter how distinguished it is in terms of science " robin lewis , chairman , board of trustees " both the numbers and what we call spend per head have been good and we just have to keep on building up the momentum so we can meet our targets .
" you would be surprised how many people have said to me , ' i went to the garden when it was first opened and there was nothing but a few sticks in the ground - it was awfully dull and i 've never been back ' .
" the key to growing visitor numbers is to have a place where there is always something developing and going on .
" the garden has been quite successful in the last 18 months in developing that ethos . "
when it was opened by prince charles in 2000 its business plan was to attract more than 200,000 visitors a year .

the assembly government , carmarthenshire council and millennium commission came to the rescue at the eleventh hour on the understanding there would be a change in management and direction .
this year the garden looks set to beat its target of 130,000 visitors , supporting an assembly audit committee report which found it was now on a firmer financial footing .
" looking at the figures , they did very well in the first year and then it fell off , " added mr lewis .
" if you look at the website for kew gardens - on the front page it says it is one of the major visitor attractions in south-east england .
" every institution of this type has to be a visitor attraction - no matter how distinguished it is in terms of science . "
mr lamb , currently director of income and visitor operations at at bristol , takes up his post in january and will oversee a number of new developments , including a new tropical glasshouse .

the twin-bore tunnel taking the a3 under the site of special scientific interest - a sandy heathland hollow overlooked by hills - will cost £ 371m .
the project at hindhead will replace the last single carriageway section of the a3 with a dual carriageway , cutting congestion and improving air quality .
work is set to begin next year on the route connecting london and portsmouth .
created by erosion transport minister stephen ladyman said : " this is a scheme that has something for everyone .
" it will remove the daily congestion and journey unreliability caused by unacceptable bottlenecks . "
he said the move would lead to portsmouth having its own dual carriageway link to the m25 london orbital .
the scheme includes underpasses to allow horse riders , cyclists and pedestrians to cross the dual carriageway , and the construction of about five miles of track for cyclists .
the devil 's punchbowl is a large hollow overlooked by the gibbet hill , the second highest hill in the county .
legend has it that the devil spent his time tormenting the god thor by pelting him with enormous handfuls of earth , leaving a great bowl .
it was actually created by erosion as water ran down but then hit a layer of clay .

the beneficiaries nordoff robbins music therapy £ 608,000 nspcc £ 347,000 st cuthberts care £ 250,000 newcastle general hospital £ 95,000 freeman hospital £ 95,000 royal victoria infirmary children 's services £ 95,000 wilm 's tumour -lrb- institute of cancer research -rrb- £ 25,000 little hearts matter £ 25,000 friedreich 's ataxia research £ 10,000 bobby moore fund for cancer research £ 25,000 samaritan 's purse £ 25,000 gosforth high school £ 10,000 cramlington juniors fc £ 15,000 wallsend boys club £ 15,000 mr blair said : " it 's a tremendous honour for me to come along and participate in what is an act of generosity from a man who is remarkable .
" the pressures and the rewards of being at the top of professional football today are tremendous , but not everyone puts something back .
but he has .
" when you have that type of reputation in a city , people do look up to you .
" there 's a certain responsibility and i have never really had the chance to say this publicly before , but it was not just as a player that he earned people 's respect . "
the money was raised through a series of events including a testimonial game against celtic in may , in front of a packed crowd at st james ' park .
shearer said : " i was lucky enough to live my dream , to play football and get paid for it .
" there are not many people in the world who look forward to getting up in the morning and being paid an unbelievable amount of money for doing so .
" i was one of them , so for me to have taken the money would not have been right .
it was an easy decision to give it to the charities , the difficult part was deciding which charities to give it to . "

this is despite average graphics , poor commentary , a confusing menu system and , more recently , mediocre online functionality .
pro evo 6 is the first time konami 's flagship title has appeared on a " next-generation " console , giving the developers ample opportunity to stretch the game into new directions for the xbox 360 .
sadly , this opportunity remains unexploited as the sixth iteration of the series is more hesitant evolution than reinvention .
the graphics have been given a high-definition gloss , yet remain far short of the photo-real revolution we come to expect .
the commentary remains lack-lustre , the menu system has been given a few tweaks but remains baffling to all but the very dedicated , and the online play is still a token gesture .
improvements but pro evolution is still the finest football title on any platform because it remains the most dynamic articulation of the 22-man game .
even minor changes to the way the game is played result in hours of agonising by hardened fans of the series .
pro evo 6 format : pc , ps2 , x360 -lrb- reviewed -rrb- , ds , psp graphics : 7 sound : 6 gameplay : 9 enduring appeal : 9 overall : 9 the improvements are immediately obvious - no longer does the slightest hint of contact between players result in a foul ; instead you can pressurise and contain opposition players without fear of undue free kicks .
the animations of all the players are startlingly real - with seemingly hundreds of variations for every conceivable pass , run , shot , stumble , dive , trip and soaring header .
players run onto a ball with more realism , retaining momentum rather than careering into the nearest defender .
the pace of passing seems to have picked up , with slick interplay now a reality and quick free kicks have also been introduced .
lack of variety there are more tricks and feints for the " show-boaters " to master - something that disconcerts a vocal section of pro evo fans - and crossing has improved greatly , resulting in far more goals from headers .
corners and throw-ins remain clumsy , however .
the biggest disappointment is the lack of variety with the online options , which offer basic match-making for one-versus-one games .
there is no option to play co-operatively , no league , or any of the depth offered by rival title fifa 07 .
but purists are unlikely to moan too much - for anyone who was in doubt , pro evolution remains the undisputed gold standard for videogame football .

miles scott , chief executive of bradford teaching hospital nhs foundation trust , said : " illnesses affecting people in later life , such as diabetes , cancer and heart disease , are thought to be influenced by factors in pregnancy and childhood and we need to learn more to try to prevent these occurring .
" we will track the lives of 10,000 babies born in the city over the next three years from pregnancy , through childhood , until they become adults .
" we will also collect information about their parents at the same time .
" by pinpointing the causes of disease we will have the key to improving not only the health of bradford people but the health of others around the country and the world . "

but whitehaven , on the blustery cumbrian coast , is leading england 's switchover to digital television .
and with 12 months to go , the countdown has begun in earnest , especially for those tasked with making sure the population is prepared .
but like their fuzzy analogue reception , the townsfolk only have a hazy idea of what is round the corner .
set-top ' thingies ' digital uk is the body charged with making sure the uk is prepared for the old television signal being shut off .
john askew is its sole representative in the whitehaven area , covering roughly 20,000 households .
digital facts you can get the digital signal through a conventional aerial the screens will not go blank - one analogue channel will be shut off first you will need a separate digi-box for every conventional television radio will not be affected , though you will be able to get digital radio through your television the last areas to be switched over are tyne tees , london and meridian in 2012 " most people are aware something is happening and will be able to tell you where and when .
" a lot will have a fairly good idea of what they have to do in terms of the basics - people will say ' i have to get one of those set top box thingies ' .
" but what we still need to do to is make people aware it is quite a straightforward thing to get done if you get the right advice . "
he added : " there is a logistical worry that if everyone leaves it to the last minute then the resources available to fit boxes , and work on aerials if needed , is going to be stretched . "
' difficult period ' david coyles , director of local electrical store brooks , is also concerned : " some people seem to think if they have satellite or a digi-box , they do n't need to worry .
" but most households have more than one television and each one on an aerial needs its own box .

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- head-to-head : darfur situation bbc news / africa graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 08:16 gmt , friday , 27 october 2006 09:16 uk head-to-head : darfur situation gamal nkrumah , the foreign editor of leading egyptian newspaper , al-ahram , and eric reeves , professor at smith college -lrb- massachusetts -rrb- and a sudan researcher and analyst , debate what action the international community should take over the worsening conflict and humanitarian crisis in sudan 's darfur region .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us in the face of rapidly accelerating genocidal destruction in darfur , and given the ongoing collapse of humanitarian operations in vast areas of this devastated region , the international community should issue an ultimatum to the national islamic front -lrb- national congress party -rrb- regime in khartoum : immediately accept the robust force stipulated in un security council resolution 1706 -lrb- 31 august , 2006 -rrb- or face non-consensual deployment of the forces required to protect civilians and humanitarians .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the phrase " international community " is often used as a euphemism for the united states and other western powers ' political agendas .
non-consensual deployment of foreign , non-african troops , is a non-starter .
it is an act of aggression that infringes on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of sudan .
as stipulated by resolution 1706 , the deployment of foreign peacekeeping troops must have prior and explicit approval of the sudanese authorities .
previous us-led military intervention in afghanistan and iraq have aggravated the situation in the respective countries .
the worse scenario is for darfur to denigrate further into an iraqi or afghan quagmire .
the only way forward is to strengthen the african union peacekeeping contingency in darfur in both financial and logistical terms .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us the international community , as represented in resolution 1706 , has implicitly but clearly recognised the radical inability of the african union force in darfur . "
no conceivable augmentation of the au can possibly staunch the flow of genocidal violence in darfur " eric reeves sudan researcher and analyst q & a : sudan 's darfur conflict no conceivable augmentation of the au can possibly staunch the flow of genocidal violence in darfur , protect the more than four million conflict-affected persons in this vast region -lrb- including eastern chad -rrb- , or provide the protection necessary for the humanitarian operations upon which this desperate population depends - operations that are now collapsing -lrb- " in free fall " was how they were described by un humanitarian chief jan egeland a month ago -rrb- .
although 1706 " invites " khartoum 's consent , it does not require it .
while 1706 explicitly guarantees the sudan 's national sovereignty , it was passed under chapter vii authority and confers enforcement authority upon a deploying force .
what is required is not khartoum 's consent but the international will to accept unambiguously the " responsibility to protect " civilians threatened by genocide , ethnic cleansing , or crimes against humanity - a responsibility unanimously accepted by the un at its world summit in september 2005 and explicitly reaffirmed by the unanimous passage of un security council resolution 1674 -lrb- april 2006 -rrb- .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the international community would serve the interests of the people of darfur if wealthier countries - oil-rich gulf arab , western and japan - treble humanitarian relief assistance , development aid and step up medical and relief supplies in the short term .
in the longer term , trade and development aid , including investments in medical and educational services , would be vital .
also of paramount importance is improved logistical and financial support for african union peacekeepers in darfur .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us there can be no doubt that when violence finally ends , the people of darfur - particularly the targeted non-arab or african tribal populations - will need immense financial resources to rebuild their lives and communities after three-and-a-half years of genocidal destruction orchestrated by the khartoum regime .
this destruction has included the burning of thousands of villages , deliberate poisoning of water wells with human and animal corpses , destruction of food- and seed-stocks , and looting of cattle -lrb- representing generations of wealth -rrb- .
but while international assistance will be required , most of this reconstruction financing should come from khartoum , which is overwhelmingly responsible for the deliberate , ethnically-targeted destruction of lives and livelihoods throughout darfur .
international mechanisms , with effective enforcement mechanism , should be devised so that sudan 's massive oil revenues -lrb- sudan is now the third largest oil producer in africa -rrb- are directed equitably and efficiently to darfur .
other international aid will be required ; but the genocidaires must be forced to accept responsibility for the economically devastating consequences of their brutality and savage conduct of the war .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the flurry of diplomatic activity concerning darfur shows that sudan is already attracting world attention .
british international cooperation minister hilary benn and us sudan envoy andrew natsios 's recent trips to sudan , for example . "
it is sudan 's oil , like iraq 's oil , which fuels american interest in sudan " gamal nkrumah al-ahram foreign editor i suspect , though , that oil and not human rights are the main motivation behind the heightened interest of us president george w bush in sudan .
it is sudan 's oil , like iraq 's oil , which fuels american interest in sudan .
moreover , it is oil which is strengthening sudan 's international position .
un security council permanent member china , for example , which imports 6 % of its oil from sudan , will veto any anti-sudan sanctions .
the sudanese authorities capitalise upon chinese support .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us critical to understanding the issues of oil development and revenues in sudan is the country 's geography : all current oil development , exploration , and production occurs in southern sudan or along the traditional north / south border . "
there is no evidence of oil in darfur " eric reeves sudan researcher and analyst moreover , the concession rights for oil development are virtually all sewn up by asian companies and totalfinaelf of france .
the effort to suggest that oil interests in darfur - where there is no present oil production or exploration - are what lie behind western diplomacy is deeply misleading .
in fact , there is no credible evidence that darfur has significant oil reserves .
as has been suggested , what is of real significance is that china , khartoum 's primary diplomatic ally at the un , dominates the two major producing consortia in southern sudan and southern kordofan province .
if we want to understand why the national islamic front -lrb- national congress party -rrb- feels so emboldened in defying the international community , and in pursuing its genocidal counter-insurgency warfare in darfur , we should look not to western but to chinese oil interests .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt chad , darfur 's neighbour to the immediate west has huge oil reserves , there is no doubt that there are oil reserves in darfur itself .
the chinese and totalfinaelf of france know all too well that the potential for exploiting darfur 's oil in commercial quantities is tremendous .
the us is most concerned about the chinese , other asian and french monopoly of sudanese oil .
darfur is of great strategic importance it straddles libya , egypt , chad , and the central african republic .
sudan has accepted african union peacekeeping troops in darfur .
so it is best for all concerned if au troops are deployed to keep the peace in darfur .
the au troops , however , must have financial and logistical support from the un and western powers as well as oil-rich gulf arab countries .
only then will peace prevail in darfur .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us there is no evidence of oil in darfur .
reserves in more westerly parts of chad tell us nothing about darfur ; there is no geologic evidence , no seismic data - nothing that indicates there is oil in darfur .
but there is a terrifyingly great deal of evidence about the scale of human destruction that will ensue if we do not respond urgently to the acute lack of human security .
with or without khartoum 's consent , the international community must uphold its " responsibility to protect civilians " in darfur - civilians not simply unprotected by the national islamic front / national congress regime - but targets of an ongoing genocidal campaign orchestrated in khartoum .
such " responsibility to protect " supersedes claims of national sovereignty .
this principle was the explicit conclusion of the un world summit outcome document , paragraph 139 , unanimously adopted in september 2005 .
the au is simply incapable of being transformed into a force that can take up this responsibility with sufficient urgency ; it can not possibly become the force contemplated in un security council resolution 1706 .
to pretend otherwise is the treat with a scandalous moral carelessness the lives of more than four million conflict-affected darfuris .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the interests of the us should not be confused with the interests of the international community .
it is clear that the aggression against iraq was a pretext to control the vast oil reserves of that country . "
the us must stay out of darfur " gamal nkrumah al-ahram foreign editor western pressure fails to move sudan human rights and democratisation had nothing to do with the bush administration 's aims .
abu ghraib and numerous other atrocities committed against the people of iraq clearly demonstrated that the us is not interested in the welfare of the people of iraq .
neither is the bush administration interested in the welfare of the people of darfur .
the main goal of the bush administration , with its extensive oil interests , is to challenge chinese oil interests and economic clout in sudan .
the so-called " international peacekeeping force " is a euphemism for foreign military intervention which is destined to have disastrous repercussions for the people of darfur and sudan as a whole .
the us must stay out of darfur .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us to invoke iraq and abu ghraib when the issue clearly is saving lives in darfur is disingenuous .
that iraq was a terribly misconceived debacle that will haunt us foreign policy for years could not be clearer ; but this does n't diminish in the slightest the extraordinarily urgent need for international protection of the more than four million human beings the un estimates are affected by genocidal conflict in darfur and eastern chad .
just as urgent is the protection of those aid operations upon which this vast population grows increasingly dependent : humanitarian access shrinks almost daily , with many hundreds of thousands of darfuris completely beyond the reach of food and medical assistance , living without adequate clean water or shelter .
khartoum continues its large military offensives in north and west darfur , and in such a context the african union force currently deployed , even if augmented , is simply incapable of providing protection to the civilian and humanitarian populations .
un security council resolution 1706 , which khartoum defiantly rejects , provides an appropriate international force of 22,500 troops and civilian police , as well as a strong civilian protection mandate .
this force must deploy with or without khartoum 's consent , with whatever additional forces are required if consent is denied .
the alternative is to watch from afar as - in the words of un humanitarian aid chief jan egeland , " the lives of hundreds of thousands could be needlessly lost . "
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the ongoing aggression of the sudanese authorities against innocent civilians is deplorable .
however , a western , us and nato-led military intervention to end the darfur crisis would have the opposite and extremely negative impact on a volatile region . "
co-operation between arabs and indigenous non-arab communities is the only way forward " gamal nkrumah al-ahram foreign editor the fighting in darfur can not be seen in isolation of the wider regional context .
the arid sahel region of africa , and darfur is very much a part of the sahel , has witnessed a scramble over meagre resources especially between nomadic , mainly but not exclusively , arab tribes and pastoralists with non-arab agriculturalists , and has become endemic in the area .
the crisis-ridden region of the sahel is a political powder-keg .
western intervention would exacerbate matters .
in niger ethnic arabs , known as the mahamid , have recently been threatened with deportation .
in neighbouring chad , the authorities have accused khartoum of supporting the armed opposition groups including the union of forces for democracy and development .
the only way forward is to strengthen the au forces by logistical and financial support on a massive scale .
oil-rich arab countries , western nations and asian trade partners of khartoum must step up aid and trade with sudan in order to reinvigorate the sudanese economy , and especially the darfur economy shattered by years of war .
the international community must multiply humanitarian and development assistance to darfur instead of sending in troops and instigating more fighting .
peace must prevail in darfur and the entire sahel region .
co-operation between arabs and indigenous non-arab communities is the only way forward , but it must be buttressed with international development aid .
what do you think ?
do you agree with eric reeves or gamal nkrumah ?
what should the international community do ?
i agree primarily with eric reeves .
while a cursory , google-powered investigation of the natural resources in darfur suggests to me that there may in fact be commercial quantities of oil in the region , i do not believe that the concern of the thousands of people agitating internationally for un intervention in darfur is neither commercial nor imperial .
resolution 1706 stipulates that a multinational force should use force to prevent and intervene in acts of violence against civilians and , as in southern sudan , this intervention in the context of an effective political settlement has the potential to bring at least a tentative peace to the region .
isaac rowlett , milwaukee , wi -lrb- usa -rrb- since darfur has been declared as a place where genocide is committed , the sudanese govt has no right to dictate what forces intl community will bring to restore peace .
i agree with mr gamal because he has first hand knowledge of what western intervention will bring .
the downfall of khartoum govt .
it happened to his father - the champion of african cause .
bakri kenna , phoenix , usa i strongly agree with eric reeves .
i think what the international community should do is to apply the un resolution 1706 immediately .
the lives of the civilians are very important .
the case of darfur is only to be solved by international community .
au or arab community can not and will never do it .
it is beyond their power and control .
us is not interested in the oil of any nation as cairo think .
instead cairo wants southern sudan and darfur to surfer and remain poor and if possible all must die because of the water of the nile .
god of heaven has entrusted american nation and un to solve the problems of the oppressed people as well of the whole world .
according to my opinion , us and un should use force as they did in afghanistan and iraq for sake of children and women in darfur .
and i am also appealing to us and un to protect the cpa between the south and the north sudan so that no one should play with the agreement .
until we vote on 9.01.2010 for the independence of the southern sudanese people .
long live george bush and long live american people and long live un .
francis oryem oyet anakleto , newcastle , australia i 'm quite disturbed at nkrumah 's arguments - in the face of what is by any measure a genocidal crime by khartoum ; i fail to understand why anyone would hide behind anti-western propaganda to let the people of darfur suffer .
i agree with reeves - there is utterly no need for any consent from khartoum .
every day the international community fails to act , i become more convinced that the life of a black africa is seen as dispensable .
is there any morality in international politics ?
i wonder .
justice tankebe , cambridge , uk mr nkrumah predictably blames the usa and the west whereas mr reeves is entirely naive .
these problems have 2 causes : 1 .
british and french colonialist mindset when between the two of them they created dozens of ' artificial ' countries completely ignoring tribal and ethnic make-up of the region .
2 .
islam 's drive for expansion at non-muslims expense -lrb- because that 's what it is -rrb- .
marcel , the hague the best solution for darfur 's on going conflict is to support the au forces that already in sudan .
the paranoia way of thinking of sudan govt. and majority of sudanese people towards un keeping force is based on countless evidences of un partiality and mysterious agenda in post conflict environments in many parts of the world .
just look to the gross partiality that exercised on daily bases by the un peace keeping force in the tiny state of eritrea .
the un peace keeping force there is always working in favour of the usa 's ally " ethiopia " although eritrea has win the award of the international arbitrary court to their disputed territory .
regrettably , there is no a clear definition between the un and usa .
this ambiguity is supported by the endless interference of us administration in the work of un .
please leave the sudan for the sudanese .
we are capable of solving our own created problems by our own will .

eric reeves , massachusetts , us in the face of rapidly accelerating genocidal destruction in darfur , and given the ongoing collapse of humanitarian operations in vast areas of this devastated region , the international community should issue an ultimatum to the national islamic front -lrb- national congress party -rrb- regime in khartoum : immediately accept the robust force stipulated in un security council resolution 1706 -lrb- 31 august , 2006 -rrb- or face non-consensual deployment of the forces required to protect civilians and humanitarians .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the phrase " international community " is often used as a euphemism for the united states and other western powers ' political agendas .
non-consensual deployment of foreign , non-african troops , is a non-starter .
it is an act of aggression that infringes on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of sudan .
about 7,000 african union troops are deployed in darfur as stipulated by resolution 1706 , the deployment of foreign peacekeeping troops must have prior and explicit approval of the sudanese authorities .
previous us-led military intervention in afghanistan and iraq have aggravated the situation in the respective countries .
the worse scenario is for darfur to denigrate further into an iraqi or afghan quagmire .
the only way forward is to strengthen the african union peacekeeping contingency in darfur in both financial and logistical terms .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us the international community , as represented in resolution 1706 , has implicitly but clearly recognised the radical inability of the african union force in darfur .
no conceivable augmentation of the au can possibly staunch the flow of genocidal violence in darfur eric reeves sudan researcher and analyst q & a : sudan 's darfur conflict no conceivable augmentation of the au can possibly staunch the flow of genocidal violence in darfur , protect the more than four million conflict-affected persons in this vast region -lrb- including eastern chad -rrb- , or provide the protection necessary for the humanitarian operations upon which this desperate population depends - operations that are now collapsing -lrb- " in free fall " was how they were described by un humanitarian chief jan egeland a month ago -rrb- .
although 1706 " invites " khartoum 's consent , it does not require it .
while 1706 explicitly guarantees the sudan 's national sovereignty , it was passed under chapter vii authority and confers enforcement authority upon a deploying force .
what is required is not khartoum 's consent but the international will to accept unambiguously the " responsibility to protect " civilians threatened by genocide , ethnic cleansing , or crimes against humanity - a responsibility unanimously accepted by the un at its world summit in september 2005 and explicitly reaffirmed by the unanimous passage of un security council resolution 1674 -lrb- april 2006 -rrb- .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt more than two million people have been displaced during the conflict the international community would serve the interests of the people of darfur if wealthier countries - oil-rich gulf arab , western and japan - treble humanitarian relief assistance , development aid and step up medical and relief supplies in the short term .
in the longer term , trade and development aid , including investments in medical and educational services , would be vital .
also of paramount importance is improved logistical and financial support for african union peacekeepers in darfur .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us there can be no doubt that when violence finally ends , the people of darfur - particularly the targeted non-arab or african tribal populations - will need immense financial resources to rebuild their lives and communities after three-and-a-half years of genocidal destruction orchestrated by the khartoum regime .
see which parts of darfur are too dangerous for aid workers enlarge map this destruction has included the burning of thousands of villages , deliberate poisoning of water wells with human and animal corpses , destruction of food- and seed-stocks , and looting of cattle -lrb- representing generations of wealth -rrb- .
but while international assistance will be required , most of this reconstruction financing should come from khartoum , which is overwhelmingly responsible for the deliberate , ethnically-targeted destruction of lives and livelihoods throughout darfur .
international mechanisms , with effective enforcement mechanism , should be devised so that sudan 's massive oil revenues -lrb- sudan is now the third largest oil producer in africa -rrb- are directed equitably and efficiently to darfur .
other international aid will be required ; but the genocidaires must be forced to accept responsibility for the economically devastating consequences of their brutality and savage conduct of the war .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the flurry of diplomatic activity concerning darfur shows that sudan is already attracting world attention .
british international cooperation minister hilary benn and us sudan envoy andrew natsios 's recent trips to sudan , for example .
it is sudan 's oil , like iraq 's oil , which fuels american interest in sudan gamal nkrumah al-ahram foreign editor i suspect , though , that oil and not human rights are the main motivation behind the heightened interest of us president george w bush in sudan .
it is sudan 's oil , like iraq 's oil , which fuels american interest in sudan .
moreover , it is oil which is strengthening sudan 's international position .
un security council permanent member china , for example , which imports 6 % of its oil from sudan , will veto any anti-sudan sanctions .
the sudanese authorities capitalise upon chinese support .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us critical to understanding the issues of oil development and revenues in sudan is the country 's geography : all current oil development , exploration , and production occurs in southern sudan or along the traditional north / south border .
there is no evidence of oil in darfur eric reeves sudan researcher and analyst moreover , the concession rights for oil development are virtually all sewn up by asian companies and totalfinaelf of france .
the effort to suggest that oil interests in darfur - where there is no present oil production or exploration - are what lie behind western diplomacy is deeply misleading .
in fact , there is no credible evidence that darfur has significant oil reserves .
as has been suggested , what is of real significance is that china , khartoum 's primary diplomatic ally at the un , dominates the two major producing consortia in southern sudan and southern kordofan province .
if we want to understand why the national islamic front -lrb- national congress party -rrb- feels so emboldened in defying the international community , and in pursuing its genocidal counter-insurgency warfare in darfur , we should look not to western but to chinese oil interests .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt chad , darfur 's neighbour to the immediate west has huge oil reserves , there is no doubt that there are oil reserves in darfur itself .
the chinese and totalfinaelf of france know all too well that the potential for exploiting darfur 's oil in commercial quantities is tremendous .
the us is most concerned about the chinese , other asian and french monopoly of sudanese oil .
darfur is of great strategic importance it straddles libya , egypt , chad , and the central african republic .
sudan has accepted african union peacekeeping troops in darfur .
so it is best for all concerned if au troops are deployed to keep the peace in darfur .
the au troops , however , must have financial and logistical support from the un and western powers as well as oil-rich gulf arab countries .
only then will peace prevail in darfur .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us there is no evidence of oil in darfur .
reserves in more westerly parts of chad tell us nothing about darfur ; there is no geologic evidence , no seismic data - nothing that indicates there is oil in darfur .
but there is a terrifyingly great deal of evidence about the scale of human destruction that will ensue if we do not respond urgently to the acute lack of human security .
four million people have been affected by the conflict in darfur with or without khartoum 's consent , the international community must uphold its " responsibility to protect civilians " in darfur - civilians not simply unprotected by the national islamic front / national congress regime - but targets of an ongoing genocidal campaign orchestrated in khartoum .
such " responsibility to protect " supersedes claims of national sovereignty .
this principle was the explicit conclusion of the un world summit outcome document , paragraph 139 , unanimously adopted in september 2005 .
the au is simply incapable of being transformed into a force that can take up this responsibility with sufficient urgency ; it can not possibly become the force contemplated in un security council resolution 1706 .
to pretend otherwise is the treat with a scandalous moral carelessness the lives of more than four million conflict-affected darfuris .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the interests of the us should not be confused with the interests of the international community .
it is clear that the aggression against iraq was a pretext to control the vast oil reserves of that country .
the us must stay out of darfur gamal nkrumah al-ahram foreign editor western pressure fails to move sudan human rights and democratisation had nothing to do with the bush administration 's aims .
abu ghraib and numerous other atrocities committed against the people of iraq clearly demonstrated that the us is not interested in the welfare of the people of iraq .
neither is the bush administration interested in the welfare of the people of darfur .
the main goal of the bush administration , with its extensive oil interests , is to challenge chinese oil interests and economic clout in sudan .
the so-called " international peacekeeping force " is a euphemism for foreign military intervention which is destined to have disastrous repercussions for the people of darfur and sudan as a whole .
the us must stay out of darfur .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us to invoke iraq and abu ghraib when the issue clearly is saving lives in darfur is disingenuous .
that iraq was a terribly misconceived debacle that will haunt us foreign policy for years could not be clearer ; but this does n't diminish in the slightest the extraordinarily urgent need for international protection of the more than four million human beings the un estimates are affected by genocidal conflict in darfur and eastern chad .
just as urgent is the protection of those aid operations upon which this vast population grows increasingly dependent : humanitarian access shrinks almost daily , with many hundreds of thousands of darfuris completely beyond the reach of food and medical assistance , living without adequate clean water or shelter .
khartoum continues its large military offensives in north and west darfur , and in such a context the african union force currently deployed , even if augmented , is simply incapable of providing protection to the civilian and humanitarian populations .
un security council resolution 1706 , which khartoum defiantly rejects , provides an appropriate international force of 22,500 troops and civilian police , as well as a strong civilian protection mandate .
this force must deploy with or without khartoum 's consent , with whatever additional forces are required if consent is denied .
the alternative is to watch from afar as - in the words of un humanitarian aid chief jan egeland , " the lives of hundreds of thousands could be needlessly lost . "
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the ongoing aggression of the sudanese authorities against innocent civilians is deplorable .
however , a western , us and nato-led military intervention to end the darfur crisis would have the opposite and extremely negative impact on a volatile region .
co-operation between arabs and indigenous non-arab communities is the only way forward gamal nkrumah al-ahram foreign editor the fighting in darfur can not be seen in isolation of the wider regional context .
the arid sahel region of africa , and darfur is very much a part of the sahel , has witnessed a scramble over meagre resources especially between nomadic , mainly but not exclusively , arab tribes and pastoralists with non-arab agriculturalists , and has become endemic in the area .
the crisis-ridden region of the sahel is a political powder-keg .
western intervention would exacerbate matters .
in niger ethnic arabs , known as the mahamid , have recently been threatened with deportation .
in neighbouring chad , the authorities have accused khartoum of supporting the armed opposition groups including the union of forces for democracy and development .
the only way forward is to strengthen the au forces by logistical and financial support on a massive scale .
oil-rich arab countries , western nations and asian trade partners of khartoum must step up aid and trade with sudan in order to reinvigorate the sudanese economy , and especially the darfur economy shattered by years of war .
the international community must multiply humanitarian and development assistance to darfur instead of sending in troops and instigating more fighting .
peace must prevail in darfur and the entire sahel region .
co-operation between arabs and indigenous non-arab communities is the only way forward , but it must be buttressed with international development aid .
what do you think ?
do you agree with eric reeves or gamal nkrumah ?
what should the international community do ?
i agree primarily with eric reeves .
while a cursory , google-powered investigation of the natural resources in darfur suggests to me that there may in fact be commercial quantities of oil in the region , i do not believe that the concern of the thousands of people agitating internationally for un intervention in darfur is neither commercial nor imperial .
resolution 1706 stipulates that a multinational force should use force to prevent and intervene in acts of violence against civilians and , as in southern sudan , this intervention in the context of an effective political settlement has the potential to bring at least a tentative peace to the region .
isaac rowlett , milwaukee , wi -lrb- usa -rrb- since darfur has been declared as a place where genocide is committed , the sudanese govt has no right to dictate what forces intl community will bring to restore peace .
i agree with mr gamal because he has first hand knowledge of what western intervention will bring .
the downfall of khartoum govt .
it happened to his father - the champion of african cause .
bakri kenna , phoenix , usa i strongly agree with eric reeves .
i think what the international community should do is to apply the un resolution 1706 immediately .
the lives of the civilians are very important .
the case of darfur is only to be solved by international community .
au or arab community can not and will never do it .
it is beyond their power and control .
us is not interested in the oil of any nation as cairo think .
instead cairo wants southern sudan and darfur to surfer and remain poor and if possible all must die because of the water of the nile .
god of heaven has entrusted american nation and un to solve the problems of the oppressed people as well of the whole world .
according to my opinion , us and un should use force as they did in afghanistan and iraq for sake of children and women in darfur .
and i am also appealing to us and un to protect the cpa between the south and the north sudan so that no one should play with the agreement .
until we vote on 9.01.2010 for the independence of the southern sudanese people .
long live george bush and long live american people and long live un .
francis oryem oyet anakleto , newcastle , australia i 'm quite disturbed at nkrumah 's arguments - in the face of what is by any measure a genocidal crime by khartoum ; i fail to understand why anyone would hide behind anti-western propaganda to let the people of darfur suffer .
i agree with reeves - there is utterly no need for any consent from khartoum .
every day the international community fails to act , i become more convinced that the life of a black africa is seen as dispensable .
is there any morality in international politics ?
i wonder .
justice tankebe , cambridge , uk mr nkrumah predictably blames the usa and the west whereas mr reeves is entirely naive .
these problems have 2 causes : 1 .
british and french colonialist mindset when between the two of them they created dozens of ' artificial ' countries completely ignoring tribal and ethnic make-up of the region .
2 .
islam 's drive for expansion at non-muslims expense -lrb- because that 's what it is -rrb- .
marcel , the hague the best solution for darfur 's on going conflict is to support the au forces that already in sudan .
the paranoia way of thinking of sudan govt. and majority of sudanese people towards un keeping force is based on countless evidences of un partiality and mysterious agenda in post conflict environments in many parts of the world .
just look to the gross partiality that exercised on daily bases by the un peace keeping force in the tiny state of eritrea .
the un peace keeping force there is always working in favour of the usa 's ally " ethiopia " although eritrea has win the award of the international arbitrary court to their disputed territory .
regrettably , there is no a clear definition between the un and usa .
this ambiguity is supported by the endless interference of us administration in the work of un .

the so-called " international peacekeeping force " is a euphemism for foreign military intervention which is destined to have disastrous repercussions for the people of darfur and sudan as a whole .
the us must stay out of darfur .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us to invoke iraq and abu ghraib when the issue clearly is saving lives in darfur is disingenuous .
that iraq was a terribly misconceived debacle that will haunt us foreign policy for years could not be clearer ; but this does n't diminish in the slightest the extraordinarily urgent need for international protection of the more than four million human beings the un estimates are affected by genocidal conflict in darfur and eastern chad .
just as urgent is the protection of those aid operations upon which this vast population grows increasingly dependent : humanitarian access shrinks almost daily , with many hundreds of thousands of darfuris completely beyond the reach of food and medical assistance , living without adequate clean water or shelter .
khartoum continues its large military offensives in north and west darfur , and in such a context the african union force currently deployed , even if augmented , is simply incapable of providing protection to the civilian and humanitarian populations .
un security council resolution 1706 , which khartoum defiantly rejects , provides an appropriate international force of 22,500 troops and civilian police , as well as a strong civilian protection mandate .
this force must deploy with or without khartoum 's consent , with whatever additional forces are required if consent is denied .
the alternative is to watch from afar as - in the words of un humanitarian aid chief jan egeland , " the lives of hundreds of thousands could be needlessly lost . "
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the ongoing aggression of the sudanese authorities against innocent civilians is deplorable .
however , a western , us and nato-led military intervention to end the darfur crisis would have the opposite and extremely negative impact on a volatile region .
co-operation between arabs and indigenous non-arab communities is the only way forward gamal nkrumah al-ahram foreign editor the fighting in darfur can not be seen in isolation of the wider regional context .
the arid sahel region of africa , and darfur is very much a part of the sahel , has witnessed a scramble over meagre resources especially between nomadic , mainly but not exclusively , arab tribes and pastoralists with non-arab agriculturalists , and has become endemic in the area .
the crisis-ridden region of the sahel is a political powder-keg .
western intervention would exacerbate matters .
in niger ethnic arabs , known as the mahamid , have recently been threatened with deportation .
in neighbouring chad , the authorities have accused khartoum of supporting the armed opposition groups including the union of forces for democracy and development .
the only way forward is to strengthen the au forces by logistical and financial support on a massive scale .
oil-rich arab countries , western nations and asian trade partners of khartoum must step up aid and trade with sudan in order to reinvigorate the sudanese economy , and especially the darfur economy shattered by years of war .
the international community must multiply humanitarian and development assistance to darfur instead of sending in troops and instigating more fighting .
peace must prevail in darfur and the entire sahel region .
co-operation between arabs and indigenous non-arab communities is the only way forward , but it must be buttressed with international development aid .
what do you think ?
do you agree with eric reeves or gamal nkrumah ?
what should the international community do ?
i agree primarily with eric reeves .
while a cursory , google-powered investigation of the natural resources in darfur suggests to me that there may in fact be commercial quantities of oil in the region , i do not believe that the concern of the thousands of people agitating internationally for un intervention in darfur is neither commercial nor imperial .
resolution 1706 stipulates that a multinational force should use force to prevent and intervene in acts of violence against civilians and , as in southern sudan , this intervention in the context of an effective political settlement has the potential to bring at least a tentative peace to the region .
isaac rowlett , milwaukee , wi -lrb- usa -rrb- since darfur has been declared as a place where genocide is committed , the sudanese govt has no right to dictate what forces intl community will bring to restore peace .
i agree with mr gamal because he has first hand knowledge of what western intervention will bring .
the downfall of khartoum govt .
it happened to his father - the champion of african cause .
bakri kenna , phoenix , usa i strongly agree with eric reeves .
i think what the international community should do is to apply the un resolution 1706 immediately .
the lives of the civilians are very important .
the case of darfur is only to be solved by international community .
au or arab community can not and will never do it .
it is beyond their power and control .
us is not interested in the oil of any nation as cairo think .
instead cairo wants southern sudan and darfur to surfer and remain poor and if possible all must die because of the water of the nile .
god of heaven has entrusted american nation and un to solve the problems of the oppressed people as well of the whole world .
according to my opinion , us and un should use force as they did in afghanistan and iraq for sake of children and women in darfur .
and i am also appealing to us and un to protect the cpa between the south and the north sudan so that no one should play with the agreement .
until we vote on 9.01.2010 for the independence of the southern sudanese people .
long live george bush and long live american people and long live un .
francis oryem oyet anakleto , newcastle , australia i 'm quite disturbed at nkrumah 's arguments - in the face of what is by any measure a genocidal crime by khartoum ; i fail to understand why anyone would hide behind anti-western propaganda to let the people of darfur suffer .
i agree with reeves - there is utterly no need for any consent from khartoum .
every day the international community fails to act , i become more convinced that the life of a black africa is seen as dispensable .
is there any morality in international politics ?
i wonder .
justice tankebe , cambridge , uk mr nkrumah predictably blames the usa and the west whereas mr reeves is entirely naive .
these problems have 2 causes : 1 .
british and french colonialist mindset when between the two of them they created dozens of ' artificial ' countries completely ignoring tribal and ethnic make-up of the region .
2 .
islam 's drive for expansion at non-muslims expense -lrb- because that 's what it is -rrb- .
marcel , the hague the best solution for darfur 's on going conflict is to support the au forces that already in sudan .
the paranoia way of thinking of sudan govt. and majority of sudanese people towards un keeping force is based on countless evidences of un partiality and mysterious agenda in post conflict environments in many parts of the world .
just look to the gross partiality that exercised on daily bases by the un peace keeping force in the tiny state of eritrea .
the un peace keeping force there is always working in favour of the usa 's ally " ethiopia " although eritrea has win the award of the international arbitrary court to their disputed territory .
regrettably , there is no a clear definition between the un and usa .
this ambiguity is supported by the endless interference of us administration in the work of un .
please leave the sudan for the sudanese .
we are capable of solving our own created problems by our own will .

eric reeves , massachusetts , us in the face of rapidly accelerating genocidal destruction in darfur , and given the ongoing collapse of humanitarian operations in vast areas of this devastated region , the international community should issue an ultimatum to the national islamic front -lrb- national congress party -rrb- regime in khartoum : immediately accept the robust force stipulated in un security council resolution 1706 -lrb- 31 august , 2006 -rrb- or face non-consensual deployment of the forces required to protect civilians and humanitarians .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the phrase " international community " is often used as a euphemism for the united states and other western powers ' political agendas .
non-consensual deployment of foreign , non-african troops , is a non-starter .
it is an act of aggression that infringes on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of sudan .
about 7,000 african union troops are deployed in darfur as stipulated by resolution 1706 , the deployment of foreign peacekeeping troops must have prior and explicit approval of the sudanese authorities .
previous us-led military intervention in afghanistan and iraq have aggravated the situation in the respective countries .
the worse scenario is for darfur to denigrate further into an iraqi or afghan quagmire .
the only way forward is to strengthen the african union peacekeeping contingency in darfur in both financial and logistical terms .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us the international community , as represented in resolution 1706 , has implicitly but clearly recognised the radical inability of the african union force in darfur .
no conceivable augmentation of the au can possibly staunch the flow of genocidal violence in darfur eric reeves sudan researcher and analyst q & a : sudan 's darfur conflict no conceivable augmentation of the au can possibly staunch the flow of genocidal violence in darfur , protect the more than four million conflict-affected persons in this vast region -lrb- including eastern chad -rrb- , or provide the protection necessary for the humanitarian operations upon which this desperate population depends - operations that are now collapsing -lrb- " in free fall " was how they were described by un humanitarian chief jan egeland a month ago -rrb- .
although 1706 " invites " khartoum 's consent , it does not require it .
while 1706 explicitly guarantees the sudan 's national sovereignty , it was passed under chapter vii authority and confers enforcement authority upon a deploying force .
what is required is not khartoum 's consent but the international will to accept unambiguously the " responsibility to protect " civilians threatened by genocide , ethnic cleansing , or crimes against humanity - a responsibility unanimously accepted by the un at its world summit in september 2005 and explicitly reaffirmed by the unanimous passage of un security council resolution 1674 -lrb- april 2006 -rrb- .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt more than two million people have been displaced during the conflict the international community would serve the interests of the people of darfur if wealthier countries - oil-rich gulf arab , western and japan - treble humanitarian relief assistance , development aid and step up medical and relief supplies in the short term .
in the longer term , trade and development aid , including investments in medical and educational services , would be vital .
also of paramount importance is improved logistical and financial support for african union peacekeepers in darfur .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us there can be no doubt that when violence finally ends , the people of darfur - particularly the targeted non-arab or african tribal populations - will need immense financial resources to rebuild their lives and communities after three-and-a-half years of genocidal destruction orchestrated by the khartoum regime .
see which parts of darfur are too dangerous for aid workers enlarge map this destruction has included the burning of thousands of villages , deliberate poisoning of water wells with human and animal corpses , destruction of food- and seed-stocks , and looting of cattle -lrb- representing generations of wealth -rrb- .
but while international assistance will be required , most of this reconstruction financing should come from khartoum , which is overwhelmingly responsible for the deliberate , ethnically-targeted destruction of lives and livelihoods throughout darfur .
international mechanisms , with effective enforcement mechanism , should be devised so that sudan 's massive oil revenues -lrb- sudan is now the third largest oil producer in africa -rrb- are directed equitably and efficiently to darfur .
other international aid will be required ; but the genocidaires must be forced to accept responsibility for the economically devastating consequences of their brutality and savage conduct of the war .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the flurry of diplomatic activity concerning darfur shows that sudan is already attracting world attention .
british international cooperation minister hilary benn and us sudan envoy andrew natsios 's recent trips to sudan , for example .
it is sudan 's oil , like iraq 's oil , which fuels american interest in sudan gamal nkrumah al-ahram foreign editor i suspect , though , that oil and not human rights are the main motivation behind the heightened interest of us president george w bush in sudan .
it is sudan 's oil , like iraq 's oil , which fuels american interest in sudan .
moreover , it is oil which is strengthening sudan 's international position .
un security council permanent member china , for example , which imports 6 % of its oil from sudan , will veto any anti-sudan sanctions .
the sudanese authorities capitalise upon chinese support .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us critical to understanding the issues of oil development and revenues in sudan is the country 's geography : all current oil development , exploration , and production occurs in southern sudan or along the traditional north / south border .
there is no evidence of oil in darfur eric reeves sudan researcher and analyst moreover , the concession rights for oil development are virtually all sewn up by asian companies and totalfinaelf of france .
the effort to suggest that oil interests in darfur - where there is no present oil production or exploration - are what lie behind western diplomacy is deeply misleading .
in fact , there is no credible evidence that darfur has significant oil reserves .
as has been suggested , what is of real significance is that china , khartoum 's primary diplomatic ally at the un , dominates the two major producing consortia in southern sudan and southern kordofan province .
if we want to understand why the national islamic front -lrb- national congress party -rrb- feels so emboldened in defying the international community , and in pursuing its genocidal counter-insurgency warfare in darfur , we should look not to western but to chinese oil interests .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt chad , darfur 's neighbour to the immediate west has huge oil reserves , there is no doubt that there are oil reserves in darfur itself .
the chinese and totalfinaelf of france know all too well that the potential for exploiting darfur 's oil in commercial quantities is tremendous .
the us is most concerned about the chinese , other asian and french monopoly of sudanese oil .
darfur is of great strategic importance it straddles libya , egypt , chad , and the central african republic .
sudan has accepted african union peacekeeping troops in darfur .
so it is best for all concerned if au troops are deployed to keep the peace in darfur .
the au troops , however , must have financial and logistical support from the un and western powers as well as oil-rich gulf arab countries .
only then will peace prevail in darfur .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us there is no evidence of oil in darfur .
reserves in more westerly parts of chad tell us nothing about darfur ; there is no geologic evidence , no seismic data - nothing that indicates there is oil in darfur .
but there is a terrifyingly great deal of evidence about the scale of human destruction that will ensue if we do not respond urgently to the acute lack of human security .
four million people have been affected by the conflict in darfur with or without khartoum 's consent , the international community must uphold its " responsibility to protect civilians " in darfur - civilians not simply unprotected by the national islamic front / national congress regime - but targets of an ongoing genocidal campaign orchestrated in khartoum .
such " responsibility to protect " supersedes claims of national sovereignty .
this principle was the explicit conclusion of the un world summit outcome document , paragraph 139 , unanimously adopted in september 2005 .
the au is simply incapable of being transformed into a force that can take up this responsibility with sufficient urgency ; it can not possibly become the force contemplated in un security council resolution 1706 .
to pretend otherwise is the treat with a scandalous moral carelessness the lives of more than four million conflict-affected darfuris .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the interests of the us should not be confused with the interests of the international community .
it is clear that the aggression against iraq was a pretext to control the vast oil reserves of that country .
the us must stay out of darfur gamal nkrumah al-ahram foreign editor western pressure fails to move sudan human rights and democratisation had nothing to do with the bush administration 's aims .
abu ghraib and numerous other atrocities committed against the people of iraq clearly demonstrated that the us is not interested in the welfare of the people of iraq .
neither is the bush administration interested in the welfare of the people of darfur .
the main goal of the bush administration , with its extensive oil interests , is to challenge chinese oil interests and economic clout in sudan .
the so-called " international peacekeeping force " is a euphemism for foreign military intervention which is destined to have disastrous repercussions for the people of darfur and sudan as a whole .
the us must stay out of darfur .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us to invoke iraq and abu ghraib when the issue clearly is saving lives in darfur is disingenuous .
that iraq was a terribly misconceived debacle that will haunt us foreign policy for years could not be clearer ; but this does n't diminish in the slightest the extraordinarily urgent need for international protection of the more than four million human beings the un estimates are affected by genocidal conflict in darfur and eastern chad .
just as urgent is the protection of those aid operations upon which this vast population grows increasingly dependent : humanitarian access shrinks almost daily , with many hundreds of thousands of darfuris completely beyond the reach of food and medical assistance , living without adequate clean water or shelter .

un security council resolution 1706 , which khartoum defiantly rejects , provides an appropriate international force of 22,500 troops and civilian police , as well as a strong civilian protection mandate .
this force must deploy with or without khartoum 's consent , with whatever additional forces are required if consent is denied .
the alternative is to watch from afar as - in the words of un humanitarian aid chief jan egeland , " the lives of hundreds of thousands could be needlessly lost . "
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the ongoing aggression of the sudanese authorities against innocent civilians is deplorable .
however , a western , us and nato-led military intervention to end the darfur crisis would have the opposite and extremely negative impact on a volatile region .
co-operation between arabs and indigenous non-arab communities is the only way forward gamal nkrumah al-ahram foreign editor the fighting in darfur can not be seen in isolation of the wider regional context .
the arid sahel region of africa , and darfur is very much a part of the sahel , has witnessed a scramble over meagre resources especially between nomadic , mainly but not exclusively , arab tribes and pastoralists with non-arab agriculturalists , and has become endemic in the area .

no conceivable augmentation of the au can possibly staunch the flow of genocidal violence in darfur eric reeves sudan researcher and analyst q & a : sudan 's darfur conflict no conceivable augmentation of the au can possibly staunch the flow of genocidal violence in darfur , protect the more than four million conflict-affected persons in this vast region -lrb- including eastern chad -rrb- , or provide the protection necessary for the humanitarian operations upon which this desperate population depends - operations that are now collapsing -lrb- " in free fall " was how they were described by un humanitarian chief jan egeland a month ago -rrb- .
although 1706 " invites " khartoum 's consent , it does not require it .
while 1706 explicitly guarantees the sudan 's national sovereignty , it was passed under chapter vii authority and confers enforcement authority upon a deploying force .
what is required is not khartoum 's consent but the international will to accept unambiguously the " responsibility to protect " civilians threatened by genocide , ethnic cleansing , or crimes against humanity - a responsibility unanimously accepted by the un at its world summit in september 2005 and explicitly reaffirmed by the unanimous passage of un security council resolution 1674 -lrb- april 2006 -rrb- .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt more than two million people have been displaced during the conflict the international community would serve the interests of the people of darfur if wealthier countries - oil-rich gulf arab , western and japan - treble humanitarian relief assistance , development aid and step up medical and relief supplies in the short term .
in the longer term , trade and development aid , including investments in medical and educational services , would be vital .
also of paramount importance is improved logistical and financial support for african union peacekeepers in darfur .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us there can be no doubt that when violence finally ends , the people of darfur - particularly the targeted non-arab or african tribal populations - will need immense financial resources to rebuild their lives and communities after three-and-a-half years of genocidal destruction orchestrated by the khartoum regime .
see which parts of darfur are too dangerous for aid workers enlarge map this destruction has included the burning of thousands of villages , deliberate poisoning of water wells with human and animal corpses , destruction of food- and seed-stocks , and looting of cattle -lrb- representing generations of wealth -rrb- .
but while international assistance will be required , most of this reconstruction financing should come from khartoum , which is overwhelmingly responsible for the deliberate , ethnically-targeted destruction of lives and livelihoods throughout darfur .
international mechanisms , with effective enforcement mechanism , should be devised so that sudan 's massive oil revenues -lrb- sudan is now the third largest oil producer in africa -rrb- are directed equitably and efficiently to darfur .
other international aid will be required ; but the genocidaires must be forced to accept responsibility for the economically devastating consequences of their brutality and savage conduct of the war .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the flurry of diplomatic activity concerning darfur shows that sudan is already attracting world attention .
british international cooperation minister hilary benn and us sudan envoy andrew natsios 's recent trips to sudan , for example .
it is sudan 's oil , like iraq 's oil , which fuels american interest in sudan gamal nkrumah al-ahram foreign editor i suspect , though , that oil and not human rights are the main motivation behind the heightened interest of us president george w bush in sudan .
it is sudan 's oil , like iraq 's oil , which fuels american interest in sudan .
moreover , it is oil which is strengthening sudan 's international position .
un security council permanent member china , for example , which imports 6 % of its oil from sudan , will veto any anti-sudan sanctions .
the sudanese authorities capitalise upon chinese support .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us critical to understanding the issues of oil development and revenues in sudan is the country 's geography : all current oil development , exploration , and production occurs in southern sudan or along the traditional north / south border .
there is no evidence of oil in darfur eric reeves sudan researcher and analyst moreover , the concession rights for oil development are virtually all sewn up by asian companies and totalfinaelf of france .
the effort to suggest that oil interests in darfur - where there is no present oil production or exploration - are what lie behind western diplomacy is deeply misleading .
in fact , there is no credible evidence that darfur has significant oil reserves .
as has been suggested , what is of real significance is that china , khartoum 's primary diplomatic ally at the un , dominates the two major producing consortia in southern sudan and southern kordofan province .
if we want to understand why the national islamic front -lrb- national congress party -rrb- feels so emboldened in defying the international community , and in pursuing its genocidal counter-insurgency warfare in darfur , we should look not to western but to chinese oil interests .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt chad , darfur 's neighbour to the immediate west has huge oil reserves , there is no doubt that there are oil reserves in darfur itself .
the chinese and totalfinaelf of france know all too well that the potential for exploiting darfur 's oil in commercial quantities is tremendous .
the us is most concerned about the chinese , other asian and french monopoly of sudanese oil .
darfur is of great strategic importance it straddles libya , egypt , chad , and the central african republic .
sudan has accepted african union peacekeeping troops in darfur .
so it is best for all concerned if au troops are deployed to keep the peace in darfur .
the au troops , however , must have financial and logistical support from the un and western powers as well as oil-rich gulf arab countries .
only then will peace prevail in darfur .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us there is no evidence of oil in darfur .
reserves in more westerly parts of chad tell us nothing about darfur ; there is no geologic evidence , no seismic data - nothing that indicates there is oil in darfur .
but there is a terrifyingly great deal of evidence about the scale of human destruction that will ensue if we do not respond urgently to the acute lack of human security .
four million people have been affected by the conflict in darfur with or without khartoum 's consent , the international community must uphold its " responsibility to protect civilians " in darfur - civilians not simply unprotected by the national islamic front / national congress regime - but targets of an ongoing genocidal campaign orchestrated in khartoum .
such " responsibility to protect " supersedes claims of national sovereignty .
this principle was the explicit conclusion of the un world summit outcome document , paragraph 139 , unanimously adopted in september 2005 .
the au is simply incapable of being transformed into a force that can take up this responsibility with sufficient urgency ; it can not possibly become the force contemplated in un security council resolution 1706 .
to pretend otherwise is the treat with a scandalous moral carelessness the lives of more than four million conflict-affected darfuris .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the interests of the us should not be confused with the interests of the international community .
it is clear that the aggression against iraq was a pretext to control the vast oil reserves of that country .
the us must stay out of darfur gamal nkrumah al-ahram foreign editor western pressure fails to move sudan human rights and democratisation had nothing to do with the bush administration 's aims .
abu ghraib and numerous other atrocities committed against the people of iraq clearly demonstrated that the us is not interested in the welfare of the people of iraq .
neither is the bush administration interested in the welfare of the people of darfur .
the main goal of the bush administration , with its extensive oil interests , is to challenge chinese oil interests and economic clout in sudan .
the so-called " international peacekeeping force " is a euphemism for foreign military intervention which is destined to have disastrous repercussions for the people of darfur and sudan as a whole .
the us must stay out of darfur .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us to invoke iraq and abu ghraib when the issue clearly is saving lives in darfur is disingenuous .
that iraq was a terribly misconceived debacle that will haunt us foreign policy for years could not be clearer ; but this does n't diminish in the slightest the extraordinarily urgent need for international protection of the more than four million human beings the un estimates are affected by genocidal conflict in darfur and eastern chad .
just as urgent is the protection of those aid operations upon which this vast population grows increasingly dependent : humanitarian access shrinks almost daily , with many hundreds of thousands of darfuris completely beyond the reach of food and medical assistance , living without adequate clean water or shelter .
khartoum continues its large military offensives in north and west darfur , and in such a context the african union force currently deployed , even if augmented , is simply incapable of providing protection to the civilian and humanitarian populations .
un security council resolution 1706 , which khartoum defiantly rejects , provides an appropriate international force of 22,500 troops and civilian police , as well as a strong civilian protection mandate .
this force must deploy with or without khartoum 's consent , with whatever additional forces are required if consent is denied .
the alternative is to watch from afar as - in the words of un humanitarian aid chief jan egeland , " the lives of hundreds of thousands could be needlessly lost . "
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the ongoing aggression of the sudanese authorities against innocent civilians is deplorable .
however , a western , us and nato-led military intervention to end the darfur crisis would have the opposite and extremely negative impact on a volatile region .
co-operation between arabs and indigenous non-arab communities is the only way forward gamal nkrumah al-ahram foreign editor the fighting in darfur can not be seen in isolation of the wider regional context .
the arid sahel region of africa , and darfur is very much a part of the sahel , has witnessed a scramble over meagre resources especially between nomadic , mainly but not exclusively , arab tribes and pastoralists with non-arab agriculturalists , and has become endemic in the area .
the crisis-ridden region of the sahel is a political powder-keg .
western intervention would exacerbate matters .
in niger ethnic arabs , known as the mahamid , have recently been threatened with deportation .
in neighbouring chad , the authorities have accused khartoum of supporting the armed opposition groups including the union of forces for democracy and development .
the only way forward is to strengthen the au forces by logistical and financial support on a massive scale .
oil-rich arab countries , western nations and asian trade partners of khartoum must step up aid and trade with sudan in order to reinvigorate the sudanese economy , and especially the darfur economy shattered by years of war .
the international community must multiply humanitarian and development assistance to darfur instead of sending in troops and instigating more fighting .
peace must prevail in darfur and the entire sahel region .
co-operation between arabs and indigenous non-arab communities is the only way forward , but it must be buttressed with international development aid .
what do you think ?
do you agree with eric reeves or gamal nkrumah ?
what should the international community do ?
i agree primarily with eric reeves .
while a cursory , google-powered investigation of the natural resources in darfur suggests to me that there may in fact be commercial quantities of oil in the region , i do not believe that the concern of the thousands of people agitating internationally for un intervention in darfur is neither commercial nor imperial .
resolution 1706 stipulates that a multinational force should use force to prevent and intervene in acts of violence against civilians and , as in southern sudan , this intervention in the context of an effective political settlement has the potential to bring at least a tentative peace to the region .
isaac rowlett , milwaukee , wi -lrb- usa -rrb- since darfur has been declared as a place where genocide is committed , the sudanese govt has no right to dictate what forces intl community will bring to restore peace .
i agree with mr gamal because he has first hand knowledge of what western intervention will bring .
the downfall of khartoum govt .
it happened to his father - the champion of african cause .
bakri kenna , phoenix , usa i strongly agree with eric reeves .
i think what the international community should do is to apply the un resolution 1706 immediately .
the lives of the civilians are very important .
the case of darfur is only to be solved by international community .
au or arab community can not and will never do it .
it is beyond their power and control .
us is not interested in the oil of any nation as cairo think .
instead cairo wants southern sudan and darfur to surfer and remain poor and if possible all must die because of the water of the nile .
god of heaven has entrusted american nation and un to solve the problems of the oppressed people as well of the whole world .
according to my opinion , us and un should use force as they did in afghanistan and iraq for sake of children and women in darfur .
and i am also appealing to us and un to protect the cpa between the south and the north sudan so that no one should play with the agreement .
until we vote on 9.01.2010 for the independence of the southern sudanese people .
long live george bush and long live american people and long live un .
francis oryem oyet anakleto , newcastle , australia i 'm quite disturbed at nkrumah 's arguments - in the face of what is by any measure a genocidal crime by khartoum ; i fail to understand why anyone would hide behind anti-western propaganda to let the people of darfur suffer .
i agree with reeves - there is utterly no need for any consent from khartoum .
every day the international community fails to act , i become more convinced that the life of a black africa is seen as dispensable .
is there any morality in international politics ?
i wonder .
justice tankebe , cambridge , uk mr nkrumah predictably blames the usa and the west whereas mr reeves is entirely naive .
these problems have 2 causes : 1 .
british and french colonialist mindset when between the two of them they created dozens of ' artificial ' countries completely ignoring tribal and ethnic make-up of the region .
2 .
islam 's drive for expansion at non-muslims expense -lrb- because that 's what it is -rrb- .
marcel , the hague the best solution for darfur 's on going conflict is to support the au forces that already in sudan .
the paranoia way of thinking of sudan govt. and majority of sudanese people towards un keeping force is based on countless evidences of un partiality and mysterious agenda in post conflict environments in many parts of the world .
just look to the gross partiality that exercised on daily bases by the un peace keeping force in the tiny state of eritrea .
the un peace keeping force there is always working in favour of the usa 's ally " ethiopia " although eritrea has win the award of the international arbitrary court to their disputed territory .
regrettably , there is no a clear definition between the un and usa .
this ambiguity is supported by the endless interference of us administration in the work of un .
please leave the sudan for the sudanese .
we are capable of solving our own created problems by our own will .

eric reeves , massachusetts , us in the face of rapidly accelerating genocidal destruction in darfur , and given the ongoing collapse of humanitarian operations in vast areas of this devastated region , the international community should issue an ultimatum to the national islamic front -lrb- national congress party -rrb- regime in khartoum : immediately accept the robust force stipulated in un security council resolution 1706 -lrb- 31 august , 2006 -rrb- or face non-consensual deployment of the forces required to protect civilians and humanitarians .
gamal nkrumah , cairo , egypt the phrase " international community " is often used as a euphemism for the united states and other western powers ' political agendas .
non-consensual deployment of foreign , non-african troops , is a non-starter .
it is an act of aggression that infringes on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of sudan .
about 7,000 african union troops are deployed in darfur as stipulated by resolution 1706 , the deployment of foreign peacekeeping troops must have prior and explicit approval of the sudanese authorities .
previous us-led military intervention in afghanistan and iraq have aggravated the situation in the respective countries .
the worse scenario is for darfur to denigrate further into an iraqi or afghan quagmire .
the only way forward is to strengthen the african union peacekeeping contingency in darfur in both financial and logistical terms .
eric reeves , massachusetts , us the international community , as represented in resolution 1706 , has implicitly but clearly recognised the radical inability of the african union force in darfur .

these problems have 2 causes : 1 .
british and french colonialist mindset when between the two of them they created dozens of ' artificial ' countries completely ignoring tribal and ethnic make-up of the region .
2 .
islam 's drive for expansion at non-muslims expense -lrb- because that 's what it is -rrb- .
marcel , the hague the best solution for darfur 's on going conflict is to support the au forces that already in sudan .
the paranoia way of thinking of sudan govt. and majority of sudanese people towards un keeping force is based on countless evidences of un partiality and mysterious agenda in post conflict environments in many parts of the world .
just look to the gross partiality that exercised on daily bases by the un peace keeping force in the tiny state of eritrea .
the un peace keeping force there is always working in favour of the usa 's ally " ethiopia " although eritrea has win the award of the international arbitrary court to their disputed territory .
regrettably , there is no a clear definition between the un and usa .
this ambiguity is supported by the endless interference of us administration in the work of un .
please leave the sudan for the sudanese .
we are capable of solving our own created problems by our own will .

the bbc understands raf st athan , vale of glamorgan , is the leading contender for a uk government investment which could create up to 5,000 jobs .
mr hain said st athan 's bid was " exceptional " but added the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- would decide impartially .
local mp john smith said st athan was the best site for the planned academy .
sources told bbc wales ' dragon 's eye programme that the st athan bid , led by a consortium known as metrix , is the leading contender for the project against a number of others , including raf cosford in shropshire .
if successful , troops from all the uk 's armed forces would be trained at the airbase .
speaking on the programme , mr hain said : " the st athan bid put together by metrix is a very strong bid , there 's no doubt about it .
" it will bring in thousands of jobs .
it would be a world-class facility , the like of which there is n't in the whole of europe . "
however , mr hain stressed previous job losses at st athan , including the scaling down of work on tornado jets which will see the current 900 jobs halved by next year , would not influence the mod 's decision .
" this will not be decided on what 's gone before .
it will be decided on if it 's the best bid .
" they ca n't take into account any other factors , the red dragon -lsb- fast jet repair facility -rsb- collapse or anything else , " he said .
however , he was optimistic about the benefits to the area if the training academy bid was successful .
" it will bring a huge surge in local consumption and spending in the area .
" it 's not just about st athan , which has suffered job losses in recent years , but for the whole of south wales and the surrounding areas . "
vale of glamorgan mp john smith said no other uk site could accommodate the new military training academy as well as st athan .
he said : " in its heyday , raf st athan had 14,000 personnel on that base and they worked alongside the local community without any difficulty .
" it 's the largest military base in the united kingdom .
this is a 600 acre cleared site development with the exception of the red dragon hanger .
" we can accommodate it with no problem - nobody else could - and that 's why i am so confident . "
the mod will announce the successful candidate following the end of a defence training review in november .
service personnel from across the uk would go to the academy after completing their basic training for instruction in such areas as engineering , logistics , languages and intelligence .
two investments are available , together worth up to £ 14bn .
it is believed that at least one section would go to wales .
currently 900 people work at st athan - including at the defence repair agency dara - but that number will be more than halved from march , as work on tornado jets leaves for another site after a turnaround in uk government policy .
