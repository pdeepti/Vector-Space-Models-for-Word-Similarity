" i 've said clearly that we will act along the lines of our constitution , " he said . jung 's comments came a day after a newspaper article quoted an official defense ministry report as saying that at least 2,000 german soldiers including specialist biological warfare units would be mobilized for the world cup finals the süddeutsche zeitung claimed that the soldiers , who are trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical attacks , would be stationed in each of the 12 cities where the matches will take place while two transport helicopters used to carry injured or wounded people will be based in laupheim in southern germany and in bückeburg in the northwest . it also stated that the army would erect an emergency surgical hospital in the western city of kaiserslautern and build a control tower for special flights at stuttgart airport in the south . the measures would cost around five million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- , of which 1.4 million euros would be covered by the german government and the federal states .
several opposition politicians and member of the social democrats have suggested that fifa , world soccer 's governing body , should foot the bill . domestic defense deployment unconstitutional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany army has served on home soil but not in a security role in theory , the measures would not constitute a domestic deployment of the german army which is banned by the country 's constitution , drawn up in 1945 after the fall of the third reich . hitler 's use of the wehrmacht before and during world war ii effectively turned nazi germany into a police state .
to use the army in a domestic defense capability would need a change to the constitution , something most german politicians are very wary of considering the lessons of the mid-20th century . supporters of the plan to deploy the modern day bundeswehr as security at the world cup say that this is all ancient history and that what applied to germany 60 years ago is irrelevant as the country , as host of the world 's largest single sports event , faces other challenges , including terrorism and hooligans . despite jung 's assertion that the bundeswehr will not be used , campaigners for the use of the german army at the world cup showed they had not been defeated in a parliamentary session on friday . schäuble 's plan takes a different tack to avoid all-out rejection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has another trick up his sleeve conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble 's proposal to change the constitution to allow the bundeswehr to be deployed on home soil was once again given an airing in the bundestag and was once again , for the time being at least , suspended . a constitutional change would require a two-thirds majority vote in favor ; a decision which at the present time seems unlikely .
but schäuble 's spokesperson stefan kaller told parliament that german soldiers could be used in a domestic security capacity if individual soldiers were deputized as police officers , allowing them to be used in the protection of buildings and other sensitive sites . the christian democratic union 's wolfgang bosbach announced shortly after that the application for the use of the deployment of the bundeswehr would be debated and decided upon " quickly " given the new alternatives to a constitutional change . opinions divided on bundeswehr world cup mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some oppose the deployment , others believe it would help the overstretched police force the ideas of deploying and / or deputizing soldiers were again met with opposition .

" if it becomes clear that both the government in kinshasa and monuc see an urgent need for an eu rapid deployment force , germany can not really stay on the sidelines , " schäfer said .
" but the bundeswehr can not overstretch its resources , which is why we 're thinking more in terms of logistical assistance during the elections . " pla n s already u n der way ? die welt reported that the bundeswehr is already planning for the mission .
the paper said that the german contingent is to be made up of air-transport capabilities , communications experts as well as medical staff and engineers . the eu agreed last week to help in the drc 's parliamentary and presidential elections , which un officials believe will be held before june . the polls , under a constitution drafted with eu mediation last year , are meant to draw a line under five years of civil war from 1998 to 2003 during which an estimated 4 million people died of hunger , disease and violence . spd co n cer n ed but merkel 's coalition partners , the social democrats , are skeptical about the bundeswehr 's involvement in congo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child soldiers in the drc " i think the bundeswehr troops would face tremendous problems unlike any they 've ever had to deal with - i 'm talking about an armed conflict in which child soldiers are involved , " said reinhold robbe , senior defense expert of the spd . " our troops do n't have any experience at all in coping with that kind of a situation . " but for jason stearns , drc expert of the non-governmental organization international crisis group , the eu 's involvement in the elections is crucial .
he said that the united nations monuc peacekeepers alone would n't be able to ensure stability during the elections . " there are many weapons that have been distributed to civilians and there are factions who do n't want to lose power and who 'd do anything including inciting ethnic violence to stop the electoral process , " stearns said .

but do unions have the clout to make significant demands of employers ? garbage collectors , hospital staffers and child care workers in one of germany 's 16 states went out on strike this week as union bosses warned that civil service workers across the country may join the work stoppage next week .
it 's the first big public sector walkout in 14 years .
the dispute centers on the push by governments to increase the average employee work week from 38.5 to 40 hours without a corresponding increase in pay .
" without compensation for the extra hours , we 're not going to do it , " said one worker preparing to picket outside of a stuttgart government building . the public service workers believe they have the public on their side , even if much of the private sector in germany has already moved to 40 hours of work per week . wro n g issue at the wro n g time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unions see increasing profits in the private sector as cause to make significant new demands hilmar schneider , director of labor policy at bonn 's institute for the study of labor in bonn , believes the union representing the workers , ver.di , has gone too far . " the issue is 18 minutes per day working without being compensated , " schneider said . " is it really worth going on strike for the first time in 14 years ? " however , ursula engelen-kefer , deputy director of the federation of german trade unions , asked whether it is really worth it for state and local governments " to provoke such a big conflict over 18 minutes ? " engelen-kefer is tracking the public sector labor conflict , noting similarities with moves by private companies in search of profits which are trying to gain more concessions from unions .
some analysts have given credit to german workers for responding to globalization pressures by accepting lower wage increases and longer working hours than other european countries .
german jobs have been saved as a result , they say .
but a number of german companies have posted record profits recently .
those profits have led some unions to include significant wage increases in their strategic plans for upcoming negotiations .

previously common worker benefits were mandated by the government , not by negotiations between workers and employers .
" so unions did n't have to a hard life , " schneider said .
" they could concentrate on wage negotiations , but did n't have to talk about special programs for older workers or lay off protection .
but that has changed now . " short-term victories schneider reckons there are tough times ahead for germany 's unions .
he thinks he knows exactly where the present labor action in the public sector is likely to go .

but do unions have the clout to make significant demands of employers ? garbage collectors , hospital staffers and child care workers in one of germany 's 16 states went out on strike this week as union bosses warned that civil service workers across the country may join the work stoppage next week .
it 's the first big public sector walkout in 14 years .
the dispute centers on the push by governments to increase the average employee work week from 38.5 to 40 hours without a corresponding increase in pay .
" without compensation for the extra hours , we 're not going to do it , " said one worker preparing to picket outside of a stuttgart government building . the public service workers believe they have the public on their side , even if much of the private sector in germany has already moved to 40 hours of work per week . wro n g issue at the wro n g time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unions see increasing profits in the private sector as cause to make significant new demands hilmar schneider , director of labor policy at bonn 's institute for the study of labor in bonn , believes the union representing the workers , ver.di , has gone too far . " the issue is 18 minutes per day working without being compensated , " schneider said . " is it really worth going on strike for the first time in 14 years ? " however , ursula engelen-kefer , deputy director of the federation of german trade unions , asked whether it is really worth it for state and local governments " to provoke such a big conflict over 18 minutes ?

some analysts have given credit to german workers for responding to globalization pressures by accepting lower wage increases and longer working hours than other european countries .

those profits have led some unions to include significant wage increases in their strategic plans for upcoming negotiations .

previously common worker benefits were mandated by the government , not by negotiations between workers and employers .
" so unions did n't have to a hard life , " schneider said .
" they could concentrate on wage negotiations , but did n't have to talk about special programs for older workers or lay off protection .
but that has changed now . " short-term victories schneider reckons there are tough times ahead for germany 's unions .
he thinks he knows exactly where the present labor action in the public sector is likely to go .

but once garbage begins to pile up , or snow remains on the streets , " it 's only a matter of days before the people turn their anger from those who are striking to those who are preventing the strike from coming to an end , " schneider said .

" i 've said clearly that we will act along the lines of our constitution , " he said . jung 's comments came a day after a newspaper article quoted an official defense ministry report as saying that at least 2,000 german soldiers including specialist biological warfare units would be mobilized for the world cup finals the süddeutsche zeitung claimed that the soldiers , who are trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical attacks , would be stationed in each of the 12 cities where the matches will take place while two transport helicopters used to carry injured or wounded people will be based in laupheim in southern germany and in bückeburg in the northwest . it also stated that the army would erect an emergency surgical hospital in the western city of kaiserslautern and build a control tower for special flights at stuttgart airport in the south . the measures would cost around five million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- , of which 1.4 million euros would be covered by the german government and the federal states .
several opposition politicians and member of the social democrats have suggested that fifa , world soccer 's governing body , should foot the bill . domestic defense deployment unconstitutional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany army has served on home soil but not in a security role in theory , the measures would not constitute a domestic deployment of the german army which is banned by the country 's constitution , drawn up in 1945 after the fall of the third reich . hitler 's use of the wehrmacht before and during world war ii effectively turned nazi germany into a police state .
to use the army in a domestic defense capability would need a change to the constitution , something most german politicians are very wary of considering the lessons of the mid-20th century . supporters of the plan to deploy the modern day bundeswehr as security at the world cup say that this is all ancient history and that what applied to germany 60 years ago is irrelevant as the country , as host of the world 's largest single sports event , faces other challenges , including terrorism and hooligans . despite jung 's assertion that the bundeswehr will not be used , campaigners for the use of the german army at the world cup showed they had not been defeated in a parliamentary session on friday . schäuble 's plan takes a different tack to avoid all-out rejection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has another trick up his sleeve conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble 's proposal to change the constitution to allow the bundeswehr to be deployed on home soil was once again given an airing in the bundestag and was once again , for the time being at least , suspended . a constitutional change would require a two-thirds majority vote in favor ; a decision which at the present time seems unlikely .
but schäuble 's spokesperson stefan kaller told parliament that german soldiers could be used in a domestic security capacity if individual soldiers were deputized as police officers , allowing them to be used in the protection of buildings and other sensitive sites . the christian democratic union 's wolfgang bosbach announced shortly after that the application for the use of the deployment of the bundeswehr would be debated and decided upon " quickly " given the new alternatives to a constitutional change . opinions divided on bundeswehr world cup mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some oppose the deployment , others believe it would help the overstretched police force the ideas of deploying and / or deputizing soldiers were again met with opposition .
social democrat dieter wiefelspütz from the interior ministry told the bundestag that the constitution would not be changed while schleswig-holstein 's minister of the interior ralf stegner warned about the " militarization of internal security . " the debate continues to rage as germany 's policing capacities bend under the strain of dealing with multiple threats and challenges even before the tournament begins . for months , the organizers of the world cup have been working on comprehensive security plans to protect spectators , players and vips from around the world . under these plans , germany 's police force will be stretched very thin , a situation which has added extra weight to the argument for a domestic deployment of the army . public opinion in germany is pretty much evenly divided over the issue with some arguing that the army could easily be used to guard key buildings and would not have to be deployed in high profile areas , like stadiums or entertainment districts . others point out that the army is not trained for public security operations and lacks the necessary sensitivity in dealing with such encounters .
both may be right , but as günther beckstein , bavaria 's interior minister , argued , using the armed forces would take some of the pressure off the police . " all measures by the army to assume duties , like the protection of property , would free up hundreds of police for actual police work , " the christian social union politician said . nato ready to help , germany unwilling to pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : awacs planes will be available to germany , and fifa will be expected to pay armed forces , not specifically the german army , have already been penciled in for security duties at the world cup with nato officials declaring recently that the alliance fully expects to be called upon by the german government to provide awacs surveillance planes at the world cup , a request that nato would oblige . this in turn has created further friction as the german government has made it clear that it would not expect to pay for the added security at the world cup and that it would pass the bill to fifa .
soccer officials are less than happy about the prospect of having to stump up the cash to hire nato planes and possibly pay for further measures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians divided over army deployment for world cup as germany prepares to host the soccer world cup next year , security concerns are looming large .

" if it becomes clear that both the government in kinshasa and monuc see an urgent need for an eu rapid deployment force , germany can not really stay on the sidelines , " schäfer said .
" but the bundeswehr can not overstretch its resources , which is why we 're thinking more in terms of logistical assistance during the elections . " pla n s already u n der way ? die welt reported that the bundeswehr is already planning for the mission .
the paper said that the german contingent is to be made up of air-transport capabilities , communications experts as well as medical staff and engineers . the eu agreed last week to help in the drc 's parliamentary and presidential elections , which un officials believe will be held before june . the polls , under a constitution drafted with eu mediation last year , are meant to draw a line under five years of civil war from 1998 to 2003 during which an estimated 4 million people died of hunger , disease and violence . spd co n cer n ed but merkel 's coalition partners , the social democrats , are skeptical about the bundeswehr 's involvement in congo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child soldiers in the drc " i think the bundeswehr troops would face tremendous problems unlike any they 've ever had to deal with - i 'm talking about an armed conflict in which child soldiers are involved , " said reinhold robbe , senior defense expert of the spd . " our troops do n't have any experience at all in coping with that kind of a situation . " but for jason stearns , drc expert of the non-governmental organization international crisis group , the eu 's involvement in the elections is crucial .
he said that the united nations monuc peacekeepers alone would n't be able to ensure stability during the elections . " there are many weapons that have been distributed to civilians and there are factions who do n't want to lose power and who 'd do anything including inciting ethnic violence to stop the electoral process , " stearns said .
" the only way to ensure stability during the elections is to actually have troops on the ground .

" if it becomes clear that both the government in kinshasa and monuc see an urgent need for an eu rapid deployment force , germany can not really stay on the sidelines , " schäfer said .
" but the bundeswehr can not overstretch its resources , which is why we 're thinking more in terms of logistical assistance during the elections . " pla n s already u n der way ? die welt reported that the bundeswehr is already planning for the mission .
the paper said that the german contingent is to be made up of air-transport capabilities , communications experts as well as medical staff and engineers . the eu agreed last week to help in the drc 's parliamentary and presidential elections , which un officials believe will be held before june . the polls , under a constitution drafted with eu mediation last year , are meant to draw a line under five years of civil war from 1998 to 2003 during which an estimated 4 million people died of hunger , disease and violence . spd co n cer n ed but merkel 's coalition partners , the social democrats , are skeptical about the bundeswehr 's involvement in congo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child soldiers in the drc " i think the bundeswehr troops would face tremendous problems unlike any they 've ever had to deal with - i 'm talking about an armed conflict in which child soldiers are involved , " said reinhold robbe , senior defense expert of the spd . " our troops do n't have any experience at all in coping with that kind of a situation . " but for jason stearns , drc expert of the non-governmental organization international crisis group , the eu 's involvement in the elections is crucial .
he said that the united nations monuc peacekeepers alone would n't be able to ensure stability during the elections . " there are many weapons that have been distributed to civilians and there are factions who do n't want to lose power and who 'd do anything including inciting ethnic violence to stop the electoral process , " stearns said .

but do unions have the clout to make significant demands of employers ? garbage collectors , hospital staffers and child care workers in one of germany 's 16 states went out on strike this week as union bosses warned that civil service workers across the country may join the work stoppage next week .
it 's the first big public sector walkout in 14 years .
the dispute centers on the push by governments to increase the average employee work week from 38.5 to 40 hours without a corresponding increase in pay .
" without compensation for the extra hours , we 're not going to do it , " said one worker preparing to picket outside of a stuttgart government building . the public service workers believe they have the public on their side , even if much of the private sector in germany has already moved to 40 hours of work per week . wro n g issue at the wro n g time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unions see increasing profits in the private sector as cause to make significant new demands hilmar schneider , director of labor policy at bonn 's institute for the study of labor in bonn , believes the union representing the workers , ver.di , has gone too far . " the issue is 18 minutes per day working without being compensated , " schneider said . " is it really worth going on strike for the first time in 14 years ? " however , ursula engelen-kefer , deputy director of the federation of german trade unions , asked whether it is really worth it for state and local governments " to provoke such a big conflict over 18 minutes ? " engelen-kefer is tracking the public sector labor conflict , noting similarities with moves by private companies in search of profits which are trying to gain more concessions from unions .
some analysts have given credit to german workers for responding to globalization pressures by accepting lower wage increases and longer working hours than other european countries .
german jobs have been saved as a result , they say .
but a number of german companies have posted record profits recently .
those profits have led some unions to include significant wage increases in their strategic plans for upcoming negotiations . " it 's a clear cut division in society between those who have the benefits , who are very small in numbers and are very exclusive , while more and more parts of the population have to bear all of the sarcrifices , " engelen-kefer said . decli n i n g u n io n stre n gth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers have made major concessions to employers in recent years to ensure their jobs stay put .
labor union membership numbers have fallen dramatically in the last decade , however , and the general strength of germany 's unions has been in decline . labor market watcher schneider wonders if there is too much nostalgia for the days of the four and a half day work week and the guaranteed 30 days of vacation .
previously common worker benefits were mandated by the government , not by negotiations between workers and employers .
" so unions did n't have to a hard life , " schneider said .
" they could concentrate on wage negotiations , but did n't have to talk about special programs for older workers or lay off protection .
but that has changed now . " short-term victories schneider reckons there are tough times ahead for germany 's unions .
he thinks he knows exactly where the present labor action in the public sector is likely to go .
first , the german people will be angry about civil servants going on strike , schneider believes , in part because of their perceived safe and cushy jobs .
but once garbage begins to pile up , or snow remains on the streets , " it 's only a matter of days before the people turn their anger from those who are striking to those who are preventing the strike from coming to an end , " schneider said .
government employers " will be forced to make some offers to the unions . " but unions should not expect that any success in coming days will lay meaningful groundwork for future victories , schneider warned .
he added that germany 's younger generations have already gotten the message regarding a completely different labor environment than the type enjoyed by their parents and grandparents . kyle mckinnon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .
the mutation could occur if h5n1 co-infects a human who already has ordinary flu or the agent is picked up from poultry by an animal such as a pig that can carry both bird and regular flu strains . past pandemics : the 20th century saw three flu pandemics , in 1918-19 , 1957-58 and 1968-69 .
the 1918-19 pandemic killed as many as 50 million people - larger than the death toll from aids in more than two decades .
jet travel , the world 's huge population today and the larger number of people with compromised immune systems -lrb- from hiv and cancer , for instance -rrb- compared with 1918 could contribute to a far heavier toll . economic cost : a global pandemic of any scale would cost hundreds of billions of dollars because of the disruption to economic life .
the world bank estimates a bill of $ 550 billion -lrb- 465 billion euros -rrb- for rich countries alone .
the asian development bank -lrb- adb -rrb- estimates costs for asia ranging from $ 99 billion to $ 283 billion .
as a comparison , severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which killed fewer than 800 people in its 2003 outbreak , cost more than $ 30 billion . veterinary controls : these are the time-honored first line of defense in any outbreak of animal disease .
the task is to identify farms where there is an outbreak of h5n1 , quarantine the area , kill all fowl suspected to be in contact with it , disinfect machinery , vehicles and clothing , and bar sales of poultry products from the affected region .
but these controls are only really dependable if a country has a good surveillance network and responds quickly and effectively to an outbreak .
adequate compensation , too , is essential for encouraging honest reporting by farmers . counter-measures : an international conference in beijing drew more than $ 1.9 billion dollars in pledges to help fight bird flu , after experts estimated that around that amount would be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defenses .
an action plan drawn up in november stresses greater veterinary surveillance to detect outbreaks , preventative vaccination of poultry , culling of infected flocks and compensation for farmers .
its other focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . vaccine : no definitive vaccine against the viral threat is available as no one knows the precise shape the virus would take after mutating .
several prototypes are being explored .
but the risk is that they could be only partially effective or even useless because the genetic shape of the virus will have changed and thus will not be recognized by antibodies .
if a pandemic does occur , the big concern is about the delay .
it could take up to six months to formulate and test the right vaccine , which will only be available in limited quantities immediately thereafter .
traditionally , flu vaccines take up to nine months to manufacture , using egg-based technology , although ways of speeding this up using genetic " reverse engineering " are being intensively explored . drug arsenal : the range of antiviral drugs is small , but especially so when it comes to bird flu .
only two are considered effective against h5n1 : zanamivir -lrb- commercialized as relenza -rrb- and oseltamivir -lrb- tamiflu -rrb- .
these medications are called neuraminidase inhibitors , which block the virus from replicating .
if taken within a couple of days of the onset of illness , they can ease the severity of some symptoms and reduce the duration of sickness .
the who recommends that countries stockpile antivirals , but does not give a figure as to how big that stockpile should be .
it hopes to have its own stockpile , sufficient for three million people , by early 2006 .

there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .
the mutation could occur if h5n1 co-infects a human who already has ordinary flu or the agent is picked up from poultry by an animal such as a pig that can carry both bird and regular flu strains . past pandemics : the 20th century saw three flu pandemics , in 1918-19 , 1957-58 and 1968-69 .
the 1918-19 pandemic killed as many as 50 million people - larger than the death toll from aids in more than two decades .
jet travel , the world 's huge population today and the larger number of people with compromised immune systems -lrb- from hiv and cancer , for instance -rrb- compared with 1918 could contribute to a far heavier toll . economic cost : a global pandemic of any scale would cost hundreds of billions of dollars because of the disruption to economic life .
the world bank estimates a bill of $ 550 billion -lrb- 465 billion euros -rrb- for rich countries alone .
the asian development bank -lrb- adb -rrb- estimates costs for asia ranging from $ 99 billion to $ 283 billion .
as a comparison , severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which killed fewer than 800 people in its 2003 outbreak , cost more than $ 30 billion . veterinary controls : these are the time-honored first line of defense in any outbreak of animal disease .
the task is to identify farms where there is an outbreak of h5n1 , quarantine the area , kill all fowl suspected to be in contact with it , disinfect machinery , vehicles and clothing , and bar sales of poultry products from the affected region .
but these controls are only really dependable if a country has a good surveillance network and responds quickly and effectively to an outbreak .
adequate compensation , too , is essential for encouraging honest reporting by farmers . counter-measures : an international conference in beijing drew more than $ 1.9 billion dollars in pledges to help fight bird flu , after experts estimated that around that amount would be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defenses .
an action plan drawn up in november stresses greater veterinary surveillance to detect outbreaks , preventative vaccination of poultry , culling of infected flocks and compensation for farmers .
its other focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . vaccine : no definitive vaccine against the viral threat is available as no one knows the precise shape the virus would take after mutating .
several prototypes are being explored .
but the risk is that they could be only partially effective or even useless because the genetic shape of the virus will have changed and thus will not be recognized by antibodies .
if a pandemic does occur , the big concern is about the delay .
it could take up to six months to formulate and test the right vaccine , which will only be available in limited quantities immediately thereafter .
traditionally , flu vaccines take up to nine months to manufacture , using egg-based technology , although ways of speeding this up using genetic " reverse engineering " are being intensively explored . drug arsenal : the range of antiviral drugs is small , but especially so when it comes to bird flu .
only two are considered effective against h5n1 : zanamivir -lrb- commercialized as relenza -rrb- and oseltamivir -lrb- tamiflu -rrb- .
these medications are called neuraminidase inhibitors , which block the virus from replicating .
if taken within a couple of days of the onset of illness , they can ease the severity of some symptoms and reduce the duration of sickness .
the who recommends that countries stockpile antivirals , but does not give a figure as to how big that stockpile should be .
it hopes to have its own stockpile , sufficient for three million people , by early 2006 .
a looming worry is whether the shifting virus might become resistant to tamiflu . sources : who , us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- , us national institutes of health -lrb- nih -rrb- , world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , nature , british medical journal -lrb- bmj -rrb- , the lancet , new england journal of medicine -lrb- nejm -rrb- , us department of health and human resources , news reports . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the continuing threat dw-world 's dossier of articles on the bird flu threat to europe .

here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .
the mutation could occur if h5n1 co-infects a human who already has ordinary flu or the agent is picked up from poultry by an animal such as a pig that can carry both bird and regular flu strains . past pandemics : the 20th century saw three flu pandemics , in 1918-19 , 1957-58 and 1968-69 .
the 1918-19 pandemic killed as many as 50 million people - larger than the death toll from aids in more than two decades .
jet travel , the world 's huge population today and the larger number of people with compromised immune systems -lrb- from hiv and cancer , for instance -rrb- compared with 1918 could contribute to a far heavier toll . economic cost : a global pandemic of any scale would cost hundreds of billions of dollars because of the disruption to economic life .
the world bank estimates a bill of $ 550 billion -lrb- 465 billion euros -rrb- for rich countries alone .
the asian development bank -lrb- adb -rrb- estimates costs for asia ranging from $ 99 billion to $ 283 billion .
as a comparison , severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which killed fewer than 800 people in its 2003 outbreak , cost more than $ 30 billion . veterinary controls : these are the time-honored first line of defense in any outbreak of animal disease .
the task is to identify farms where there is an outbreak of h5n1 , quarantine the area , kill all fowl suspected to be in contact with it , disinfect machinery , vehicles and clothing , and bar sales of poultry products from the affected region .
but these controls are only really dependable if a country has a good surveillance network and responds quickly and effectively to an outbreak .
adequate compensation , too , is essential for encouraging honest reporting by farmers . counter-measures : an international conference in beijing drew more than $ 1.9 billion dollars in pledges to help fight bird flu , after experts estimated that around that amount would be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defenses .
an action plan drawn up in november stresses greater veterinary surveillance to detect outbreaks , preventative vaccination of poultry , culling of infected flocks and compensation for farmers .
its other focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . vaccine : no definitive vaccine against the viral threat is available as no one knows the precise shape the virus would take after mutating .
several prototypes are being explored .
but the risk is that they could be only partially effective or even useless because the genetic shape of the virus will have changed and thus will not be recognized by antibodies .
if a pandemic does occur , the big concern is about the delay .
it could take up to six months to formulate and test the right vaccine , which will only be available in limited quantities immediately thereafter .
traditionally , flu vaccines take up to nine months to manufacture , using egg-based technology , although ways of speeding this up using genetic " reverse engineering " are being intensively explored . drug arsenal : the range of antiviral drugs is small , but especially so when it comes to bird flu .
only two are considered effective against h5n1 : zanamivir -lrb- commercialized as relenza -rrb- and oseltamivir -lrb- tamiflu -rrb- .
these medications are called neuraminidase inhibitors , which block the virus from replicating .
if taken within a couple of days of the onset of illness , they can ease the severity of some symptoms and reduce the duration of sickness .
the who recommends that countries stockpile antivirals , but does not give a figure as to how big that stockpile should be .
it hopes to have its own stockpile , sufficient for three million people , by early 2006 .
a looming worry is whether the shifting virus might become resistant to tamiflu . sources : who , us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- , us national institutes of health -lrb- nih -rrb- , world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , nature , british medical journal -lrb- bmj -rrb- , the lancet , new england journal of medicine -lrb- nejm -rrb- , us department of health and human resources , news reports . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the continuing threat dw-world 's dossier of articles on the bird flu threat to europe .

here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .

but neuschwanstein and king ludwig ii 's other castles are more than an obligatory kitsch stop on a whirlwind tour . the fairy tale castle of neuschwanstein remains the focal point for most tourists traveling to germany to take in impressive scenery and architecture .
however , for those who want to experience more of the madness of king ludwig ii , there are several other of the monarch 's outlandish abodes and places of interest in the valley between ammergau and the allgäuer alps . but the king 's final home is really the big draw .
a walk of just 30 minutes takes the inquisitive traveler from schwangau to the world-famous castle .
if you can fight your way through the coach loads of tourists who always include the disney-inspiring royal domicile on their tours of central europe , you will see what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a castle built for privacy now gets over a million visitors a year every year 1.3 million people visit " the castle of the fairy-tale king " .
in the summer around 6,000 visitors a day stream through rooms that were intended for a single person . while visiting the castle as part of a tour of southern germany is as obligatory as getting sloshed at oktoberfest or the hofbräuhaus in munich , visiting rothenburg or heidelberg , there is a reason why it is an essential part of the agenda . after gaping at the dream-like beauty of the castle itself , the other-worldly nature of the interiors really start to capture the imagination .
more than any other of his homes , neuschwanstein really shows what ludwig ii was trying to achieve when he had the castle built as his retreat from public life .
ludwig escaped into a dream world in the castle - the poetic world of the middle ages – which can be seen in vivid colors throughout the extravagantly decorated rooms . wagner-inspired rooms provided an escape into a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swan from a legend that inspired wagner decorates ludwig 's private quarters the rooms are filled by picture cycles inspired by the operas of richard wagner , to whom the king dedicated the castle .
these decorations , while not directly modeled on wagner 's works , take in the medieval legends that the composer was inspired by and provided ludwig was an alternate reality in which to live out his final days in blissful insanity . " i want to remain an eternal mystery to myself and others , " ludwig once told his governess , and it is this mysterious element that adds to the buildings grandeur .
people flock to see where the shy king retreated to but also to imagine what it was like to lose one 's self in such surroundings , ludwig 's final refuge from reality . a life in castles his unconventional approach to his rule led him to build a number of outrageously intricate castles of various styles and sizes between ammergau and the allgäuer alps , each one telling a different chapter in the story of his weird and wonderful life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig was also drawn to the mysterious chiemsee lake in his father 's neo-gothic castle at hohenschwangau , for example , ludwig ii spent his formative years while the herrenchiemsee palace – a copy of the palace at versailles built on lake chiem – was created during a period when ludwig himself mirrored louis xiv 's dream of becoming not merely a king but a god .
linderhof palace with its venus grotto , moorish kiosk and moroccan house meanwhile , was the monarch 's play castle - a bit like michael jackson 's neverland ranch . but it is neuschwanstein that sums up ludwig 's tenuous grip on real life and the magical madness that led to the creation of one of europe 's most iconic castles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de palatial digs in bavaria up for grabs if you 've ever imagined living in a converted castle , now 's your chance .

" if it becomes clear that both the government in kinshasa and monuc see an urgent need for an eu rapid deployment force , germany can not really stay on the sidelines , " schäfer said .
" but the bundeswehr can not overstretch its resources , which is why we 're thinking more in terms of logistical assistance during the elections . " pla n s already u n der way ? die welt reported that the bundeswehr is already planning for the mission .
the paper said that the german contingent is to be made up of air-transport capabilities , communications experts as well as medical staff and engineers . the eu agreed last week to help in the drc 's parliamentary and presidential elections , which un officials believe will be held before june . the polls , under a constitution drafted with eu mediation last year , are meant to draw a line under five years of civil war from 1998 to 2003 during which an estimated 4 million people died of hunger , disease and violence . spd co n cer n ed but merkel 's coalition partners , the social democrats , are skeptical about the bundeswehr 's involvement in congo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child soldiers in the drc " i think the bundeswehr troops would face tremendous problems unlike any they 've ever had to deal with - i 'm talking about an armed conflict in which child soldiers are involved , " said reinhold robbe , senior defense expert of the spd . " our troops do n't have any experience at all in coping with that kind of a situation . " but for jason stearns , drc expert of the non-governmental organization international crisis group , the eu 's involvement in the elections is crucial .
he said that the united nations monuc peacekeepers alone would n't be able to ensure stability during the elections . " there are many weapons that have been distributed to civilians and there are factions who do n't want to lose power and who 'd do anything including inciting ethnic violence to stop the electoral process , " stearns said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.02.2006 germany 's labor unions inflate their worth , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers believe they still have strong public support , but analysts are n't so sure confident public service workers are on strike and heavy industry workers want big pay increases .
but do unions have the clout to make significant demands of employers ? garbage collectors , hospital staffers and child care workers in one of germany 's 16 states went out on strike this week as union bosses warned that civil service workers across the country may join the work stoppage next week .
it 's the first big public sector walkout in 14 years .
the dispute centers on the push by governments to increase the average employee work week from 38.5 to 40 hours without a corresponding increase in pay .
" without compensation for the extra hours , we 're not going to do it , " said one worker preparing to picket outside of a stuttgart government building . the public service workers believe they have the public on their side , even if much of the private sector in germany has already moved to 40 hours of work per week . wro n g issue at the wro n g time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unions see increasing profits in the private sector as cause to make significant new demands hilmar schneider , director of labor policy at bonn 's institute for the study of labor in bonn , believes the union representing the workers , ver.di , has gone too far . " the issue is 18 minutes per day working without being compensated , " schneider said . " is it really worth going on strike for the first time in 14 years ? " however , ursula engelen-kefer , deputy director of the federation of german trade unions , asked whether it is really worth it for state and local governments " to provoke such a big conflict over 18 minutes ? " engelen-kefer is tracking the public sector labor conflict , noting similarities with moves by private companies in search of profits which are trying to gain more concessions from unions .
some analysts have given credit to german workers for responding to globalization pressures by accepting lower wage increases and longer working hours than other european countries .
german jobs have been saved as a result , they say .
but a number of german companies have posted record profits recently .
those profits have led some unions to include significant wage increases in their strategic plans for upcoming negotiations . " it 's a clear cut division in society between those who have the benefits , who are very small in numbers and are very exclusive , while more and more parts of the population have to bear all of the sarcrifices , " engelen-kefer said . decli n i n g u n io n stre n gth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers have made major concessions to employers in recent years to ensure their jobs stay put .
labor union membership numbers have fallen dramatically in the last decade , however , and the general strength of germany 's unions has been in decline . labor market watcher schneider wonders if there is too much nostalgia for the days of the four and a half day work week and the guaranteed 30 days of vacation .
previously common worker benefits were mandated by the government , not by negotiations between workers and employers .
" so unions did n't have to a hard life , " schneider said .
" they could concentrate on wage negotiations , but did n't have to talk about special programs for older workers or lay off protection .
but that has changed now . " short-term victories schneider reckons there are tough times ahead for germany 's unions .
he thinks he knows exactly where the present labor action in the public sector is likely to go .
first , the german people will be angry about civil servants going on strike , schneider believes , in part because of their perceived safe and cushy jobs .
but once garbage begins to pile up , or snow remains on the streets , " it 's only a matter of days before the people turn their anger from those who are striking to those who are preventing the strike from coming to an end , " schneider said .
government employers " will be forced to make some offers to the unions . " but unions should not expect that any success in coming days will lay meaningful groundwork for future victories , schneider warned .
he added that germany 's younger generations have already gotten the message regarding a completely different labor environment than the type enjoyed by their parents and grandparents . kyle mckinnon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

" i 've said clearly that we will act along the lines of our constitution , " he said . jung 's comments came a day after a newspaper article quoted an official defense ministry report as saying that at least 2,000 german soldiers including specialist biological warfare units would be mobilized for the world cup finals the süddeutsche zeitung claimed that the soldiers , who are trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical attacks , would be stationed in each of the 12 cities where the matches will take place while two transport helicopters used to carry injured or wounded people will be based in laupheim in southern germany and in bückeburg in the northwest . it also stated that the army would erect an emergency surgical hospital in the western city of kaiserslautern and build a control tower for special flights at stuttgart airport in the south . the measures would cost around five million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- , of which 1.4 million euros would be covered by the german government and the federal states .
several opposition politicians and member of the social democrats have suggested that fifa , world soccer 's governing body , should foot the bill . domestic defense deployment unconstitutional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany army has served on home soil but not in a security role in theory , the measures would not constitute a domestic deployment of the german army which is banned by the country 's constitution , drawn up in 1945 after the fall of the third reich . hitler 's use of the wehrmacht before and during world war ii effectively turned nazi germany into a police state .
to use the army in a domestic defense capability would need a change to the constitution , something most german politicians are very wary of considering the lessons of the mid-20th century . supporters of the plan to deploy the modern day bundeswehr as security at the world cup say that this is all ancient history and that what applied to germany 60 years ago is irrelevant as the country , as host of the world 's largest single sports event , faces other challenges , including terrorism and hooligans . despite jung 's assertion that the bundeswehr will not be used , campaigners for the use of the german army at the world cup showed they had not been defeated in a parliamentary session on friday . schäuble 's plan takes a different tack to avoid all-out rejection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has another trick up his sleeve conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble 's proposal to change the constitution to allow the bundeswehr to be deployed on home soil was once again given an airing in the bundestag and was once again , for the time being at least , suspended . a constitutional change would require a two-thirds majority vote in favor ; a decision which at the present time seems unlikely .
but schäuble 's spokesperson stefan kaller told parliament that german soldiers could be used in a domestic security capacity if individual soldiers were deputized as police officers , allowing them to be used in the protection of buildings and other sensitive sites . the christian democratic union 's wolfgang bosbach announced shortly after that the application for the use of the deployment of the bundeswehr would be debated and decided upon " quickly " given the new alternatives to a constitutional change . opinions divided on bundeswehr world cup mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some oppose the deployment , others believe it would help the overstretched police force the ideas of deploying and / or deputizing soldiers were again met with opposition .
social democrat dieter wiefelspütz from the interior ministry told the bundestag that the constitution would not be changed while schleswig-holstein 's minister of the interior ralf stegner warned about the " militarization of internal security . " the debate continues to rage as germany 's policing capacities bend under the strain of dealing with multiple threats and challenges even before the tournament begins . for months , the organizers of the world cup have been working on comprehensive security plans to protect spectators , players and vips from around the world . under these plans , germany 's police force will be stretched very thin , a situation which has added extra weight to the argument for a domestic deployment of the army . public opinion in germany is pretty much evenly divided over the issue with some arguing that the army could easily be used to guard key buildings and would not have to be deployed in high profile areas , like stadiums or entertainment districts . others point out that the army is not trained for public security operations and lacks the necessary sensitivity in dealing with such encounters .
both may be right , but as günther beckstein , bavaria 's interior minister , argued , using the armed forces would take some of the pressure off the police . " all measures by the army to assume duties , like the protection of property , would free up hundreds of police for actual police work , " the christian social union politician said . nato ready to help , germany unwilling to pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : awacs planes will be available to germany , and fifa will be expected to pay armed forces , not specifically the german army , have already been penciled in for security duties at the world cup with nato officials declaring recently that the alliance fully expects to be called upon by the german government to provide awacs surveillance planes at the world cup , a request that nato would oblige . this in turn has created further friction as the german government has made it clear that it would not expect to pay for the added security at the world cup and that it would pass the bill to fifa .

here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .
the mutation could occur if h5n1 co-infects a human who already has ordinary flu or the agent is picked up from poultry by an animal such as a pig that can carry both bird and regular flu strains . past pandemics : the 20th century saw three flu pandemics , in 1918-19 , 1957-58 and 1968-69 .
the 1918-19 pandemic killed as many as 50 million people - larger than the death toll from aids in more than two decades .
jet travel , the world 's huge population today and the larger number of people with compromised immune systems -lrb- from hiv and cancer , for instance -rrb- compared with 1918 could contribute to a far heavier toll . economic cost : a global pandemic of any scale would cost hundreds of billions of dollars because of the disruption to economic life .
the world bank estimates a bill of $ 550 billion -lrb- 465 billion euros -rrb- for rich countries alone .
the asian development bank -lrb- adb -rrb- estimates costs for asia ranging from $ 99 billion to $ 283 billion .
as a comparison , severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which killed fewer than 800 people in its 2003 outbreak , cost more than $ 30 billion . veterinary controls : these are the time-honored first line of defense in any outbreak of animal disease .
the task is to identify farms where there is an outbreak of h5n1 , quarantine the area , kill all fowl suspected to be in contact with it , disinfect machinery , vehicles and clothing , and bar sales of poultry products from the affected region .
but these controls are only really dependable if a country has a good surveillance network and responds quickly and effectively to an outbreak .
adequate compensation , too , is essential for encouraging honest reporting by farmers . counter-measures : an international conference in beijing drew more than $ 1.9 billion dollars in pledges to help fight bird flu , after experts estimated that around that amount would be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defenses .
an action plan drawn up in november stresses greater veterinary surveillance to detect outbreaks , preventative vaccination of poultry , culling of infected flocks and compensation for farmers .
its other focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . vaccine : no definitive vaccine against the viral threat is available as no one knows the precise shape the virus would take after mutating .
several prototypes are being explored .
but the risk is that they could be only partially effective or even useless because the genetic shape of the virus will have changed and thus will not be recognized by antibodies .
if a pandemic does occur , the big concern is about the delay .
it could take up to six months to formulate and test the right vaccine , which will only be available in limited quantities immediately thereafter .
traditionally , flu vaccines take up to nine months to manufacture , using egg-based technology , although ways of speeding this up using genetic " reverse engineering " are being intensively explored . drug arsenal : the range of antiviral drugs is small , but especially so when it comes to bird flu .
only two are considered effective against h5n1 : zanamivir -lrb- commercialized as relenza -rrb- and oseltamivir -lrb- tamiflu -rrb- .
these medications are called neuraminidase inhibitors , which block the virus from replicating .
if taken within a couple of days of the onset of illness , they can ease the severity of some symptoms and reduce the duration of sickness .
the who recommends that countries stockpile antivirals , but does not give a figure as to how big that stockpile should be .
it hopes to have its own stockpile , sufficient for three million people , by early 2006 .
a looming worry is whether the shifting virus might become resistant to tamiflu . sources : who , us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- , us national institutes of health -lrb- nih -rrb- , world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , nature , british medical journal -lrb- bmj -rrb- , the lancet , new england journal of medicine -lrb- nejm -rrb- , us department of health and human resources , news reports . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the continuing threat dw-world 's dossier of articles on the bird flu threat to europe .

here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .
the mutation could occur if h5n1 co-infects a human who already has ordinary flu or the agent is picked up from poultry by an animal such as a pig that can carry both bird and regular flu strains . past pandemics : the 20th century saw three flu pandemics , in 1918-19 , 1957-58 and 1968-69 .
the 1918-19 pandemic killed as many as 50 million people - larger than the death toll from aids in more than two decades .
jet travel , the world 's huge population today and the larger number of people with compromised immune systems -lrb- from hiv and cancer , for instance -rrb- compared with 1918 could contribute to a far heavier toll . economic cost : a global pandemic of any scale would cost hundreds of billions of dollars because of the disruption to economic life .
the world bank estimates a bill of $ 550 billion -lrb- 465 billion euros -rrb- for rich countries alone .
the asian development bank -lrb- adb -rrb- estimates costs for asia ranging from $ 99 billion to $ 283 billion .
as a comparison , severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which killed fewer than 800 people in its 2003 outbreak , cost more than $ 30 billion . veterinary controls : these are the time-honored first line of defense in any outbreak of animal disease .
the task is to identify farms where there is an outbreak of h5n1 , quarantine the area , kill all fowl suspected to be in contact with it , disinfect machinery , vehicles and clothing , and bar sales of poultry products from the affected region .
but these controls are only really dependable if a country has a good surveillance network and responds quickly and effectively to an outbreak .
adequate compensation , too , is essential for encouraging honest reporting by farmers . counter-measures : an international conference in beijing drew more than $ 1.9 billion dollars in pledges to help fight bird flu , after experts estimated that around that amount would be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defenses .
an action plan drawn up in november stresses greater veterinary surveillance to detect outbreaks , preventative vaccination of poultry , culling of infected flocks and compensation for farmers .
its other focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . vaccine : no definitive vaccine against the viral threat is available as no one knows the precise shape the virus would take after mutating .
several prototypes are being explored .
but the risk is that they could be only partially effective or even useless because the genetic shape of the virus will have changed and thus will not be recognized by antibodies .
if a pandemic does occur , the big concern is about the delay .
it could take up to six months to formulate and test the right vaccine , which will only be available in limited quantities immediately thereafter .
traditionally , flu vaccines take up to nine months to manufacture , using egg-based technology , although ways of speeding this up using genetic " reverse engineering " are being intensively explored . drug arsenal : the range of antiviral drugs is small , but especially so when it comes to bird flu .
only two are considered effective against h5n1 : zanamivir -lrb- commercialized as relenza -rrb- and oseltamivir -lrb- tamiflu -rrb- .
these medications are called neuraminidase inhibitors , which block the virus from replicating .
if taken within a couple of days of the onset of illness , they can ease the severity of some symptoms and reduce the duration of sickness .
the who recommends that countries stockpile antivirals , but does not give a figure as to how big that stockpile should be .
it hopes to have its own stockpile , sufficient for three million people , by early 2006 .
a looming worry is whether the shifting virus might become resistant to tamiflu . sources : who , us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- , us national institutes of health -lrb- nih -rrb- , world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , nature , british medical journal -lrb- bmj -rrb- , the lancet , new england journal of medicine -lrb- nejm -rrb- , us department of health and human resources , news reports . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the continuing threat dw-world 's dossier of articles on the bird flu threat to europe .

but do unions have the clout to make significant demands of employers ? garbage collectors , hospital staffers and child care workers in one of germany 's 16 states went out on strike this week as union bosses warned that civil service workers across the country may join the work stoppage next week .
it 's the first big public sector walkout in 14 years .
the dispute centers on the push by governments to increase the average employee work week from 38.5 to 40 hours without a corresponding increase in pay .
" without compensation for the extra hours , we 're not going to do it , " said one worker preparing to picket outside of a stuttgart government building . the public service workers believe they have the public on their side , even if much of the private sector in germany has already moved to 40 hours of work per week . wro n g issue at the wro n g time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unions see increasing profits in the private sector as cause to make significant new demands hilmar schneider , director of labor policy at bonn 's institute for the study of labor in bonn , believes the union representing the workers , ver.di , has gone too far . " the issue is 18 minutes per day working without being compensated , " schneider said . " is it really worth going on strike for the first time in 14 years ? " however , ursula engelen-kefer , deputy director of the federation of german trade unions , asked whether it is really worth it for state and local governments " to provoke such a big conflict over 18 minutes ? " engelen-kefer is tracking the public sector labor conflict , noting similarities with moves by private companies in search of profits which are trying to gain more concessions from unions .
some analysts have given credit to german workers for responding to globalization pressures by accepting lower wage increases and longer working hours than other european countries .
german jobs have been saved as a result , they say .
but a number of german companies have posted record profits recently .
those profits have led some unions to include significant wage increases in their strategic plans for upcoming negotiations . " it 's a clear cut division in society between those who have the benefits , who are very small in numbers and are very exclusive , while more and more parts of the population have to bear all of the sarcrifices , " engelen-kefer said . decli n i n g u n io n stre n gth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers have made major concessions to employers in recent years to ensure their jobs stay put .
labor union membership numbers have fallen dramatically in the last decade , however , and the general strength of germany 's unions has been in decline . labor market watcher schneider wonders if there is too much nostalgia for the days of the four and a half day work week and the guaranteed 30 days of vacation .
previously common worker benefits were mandated by the government , not by negotiations between workers and employers .
" so unions did n't have to a hard life , " schneider said .
" they could concentrate on wage negotiations , but did n't have to talk about special programs for older workers or lay off protection .
but that has changed now . " short-term victories schneider reckons there are tough times ahead for germany 's unions .
he thinks he knows exactly where the present labor action in the public sector is likely to go .
first , the german people will be angry about civil servants going on strike , schneider believes , in part because of their perceived safe and cushy jobs .
but once garbage begins to pile up , or snow remains on the streets , " it 's only a matter of days before the people turn their anger from those who are striking to those who are preventing the strike from coming to an end , " schneider said .
government employers " will be forced to make some offers to the unions . " but unions should not expect that any success in coming days will lay meaningful groundwork for future victories , schneider warned .
he added that germany 's younger generations have already gotten the message regarding a completely different labor environment than the type enjoyed by their parents and grandparents . kyle mckinnon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

" the issue is 18 minutes per day working without being compensated , " schneider said . " is it really worth going on strike for the first time in 14 years ?

some analysts have given credit to german workers for responding to globalization pressures by accepting lower wage increases and longer working hours than other european countries .
german jobs have been saved as a result , they say .

" they could concentrate on wage negotiations , but did n't have to talk about special programs for older workers or lay off protection .
but that has changed now . " short-term victories schneider reckons there are tough times ahead for germany 's unions .
he thinks he knows exactly where the present labor action in the public sector is likely to go .

but once garbage begins to pile up , or snow remains on the streets , " it 's only a matter of days before the people turn their anger from those who are striking to those who are preventing the strike from coming to an end , " schneider said .
government employers " will be forced to make some offers to the unions . " but unions should not expect that any success in coming days will lay meaningful groundwork for future victories , schneider warned .

" if it becomes clear that both the government in kinshasa and monuc see an urgent need for an eu rapid deployment force , germany can not really stay on the sidelines , " schäfer said .
" but the bundeswehr can not overstretch its resources , which is why we 're thinking more in terms of logistical assistance during the elections . " pla n s already u n der way ? die welt reported that the bundeswehr is already planning for the mission .
the paper said that the german contingent is to be made up of air-transport capabilities , communications experts as well as medical staff and engineers . the eu agreed last week to help in the drc 's parliamentary and presidential elections , which un officials believe will be held before june . the polls , under a constitution drafted with eu mediation last year , are meant to draw a line under five years of civil war from 1998 to 2003 during which an estimated 4 million people died of hunger , disease and violence . spd co n cer n ed but merkel 's coalition partners , the social democrats , are skeptical about the bundeswehr 's involvement in congo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child soldiers in the drc " i think the bundeswehr troops would face tremendous problems unlike any they 've ever had to deal with - i 'm talking about an armed conflict in which child soldiers are involved , " said reinhold robbe , senior defense expert of the spd . " our troops do n't have any experience at all in coping with that kind of a situation . " but for jason stearns , drc expert of the non-governmental organization international crisis group , the eu 's involvement in the elections is crucial .
he said that the united nations monuc peacekeepers alone would n't be able to ensure stability during the elections . " there are many weapons that have been distributed to civilians and there are factions who do n't want to lose power and who 'd do anything including inciting ethnic violence to stop the electoral process , " stearns said .

" i 've said clearly that we will act along the lines of our constitution , " he said . jung 's comments came a day after a newspaper article quoted an official defense ministry report as saying that at least 2,000 german soldiers including specialist biological warfare units would be mobilized for the world cup finals the süddeutsche zeitung claimed that the soldiers , who are trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical attacks , would be stationed in each of the 12 cities where the matches will take place while two transport helicopters used to carry injured or wounded people will be based in laupheim in southern germany and in bückeburg in the northwest . it also stated that the army would erect an emergency surgical hospital in the western city of kaiserslautern and build a control tower for special flights at stuttgart airport in the south . the measures would cost around five million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- , of which 1.4 million euros would be covered by the german government and the federal states .
several opposition politicians and member of the social democrats have suggested that fifa , world soccer 's governing body , should foot the bill . domestic defense deployment unconstitutional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany army has served on home soil but not in a security role in theory , the measures would not constitute a domestic deployment of the german army which is banned by the country 's constitution , drawn up in 1945 after the fall of the third reich . hitler 's use of the wehrmacht before and during world war ii effectively turned nazi germany into a police state .
to use the army in a domestic defense capability would need a change to the constitution , something most german politicians are very wary of considering the lessons of the mid-20th century . supporters of the plan to deploy the modern day bundeswehr as security at the world cup say that this is all ancient history and that what applied to germany 60 years ago is irrelevant as the country , as host of the world 's largest single sports event , faces other challenges , including terrorism and hooligans . despite jung 's assertion that the bundeswehr will not be used , campaigners for the use of the german army at the world cup showed they had not been defeated in a parliamentary session on friday . schäuble 's plan takes a different tack to avoid all-out rejection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has another trick up his sleeve conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble 's proposal to change the constitution to allow the bundeswehr to be deployed on home soil was once again given an airing in the bundestag and was once again , for the time being at least , suspended . a constitutional change would require a two-thirds majority vote in favor ; a decision which at the present time seems unlikely .
but schäuble 's spokesperson stefan kaller told parliament that german soldiers could be used in a domestic security capacity if individual soldiers were deputized as police officers , allowing them to be used in the protection of buildings and other sensitive sites . the christian democratic union 's wolfgang bosbach announced shortly after that the application for the use of the deployment of the bundeswehr would be debated and decided upon " quickly " given the new alternatives to a constitutional change . opinions divided on bundeswehr world cup mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some oppose the deployment , others believe it would help the overstretched police force the ideas of deploying and / or deputizing soldiers were again met with opposition .
social democrat dieter wiefelspütz from the interior ministry told the bundestag that the constitution would not be changed while schleswig-holstein 's minister of the interior ralf stegner warned about the " militarization of internal security . " the debate continues to rage as germany 's policing capacities bend under the strain of dealing with multiple threats and challenges even before the tournament begins . for months , the organizers of the world cup have been working on comprehensive security plans to protect spectators , players and vips from around the world . under these plans , germany 's police force will be stretched very thin , a situation which has added extra weight to the argument for a domestic deployment of the army . public opinion in germany is pretty much evenly divided over the issue with some arguing that the army could easily be used to guard key buildings and would not have to be deployed in high profile areas , like stadiums or entertainment districts . others point out that the army is not trained for public security operations and lacks the necessary sensitivity in dealing with such encounters .
both may be right , but as günther beckstein , bavaria 's interior minister , argued , using the armed forces would take some of the pressure off the police . " all measures by the army to assume duties , like the protection of property , would free up hundreds of police for actual police work , " the christian social union politician said . nato ready to help , germany unwilling to pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : awacs planes will be available to germany , and fifa will be expected to pay armed forces , not specifically the german army , have already been penciled in for security duties at the world cup with nato officials declaring recently that the alliance fully expects to be called upon by the german government to provide awacs surveillance planes at the world cup , a request that nato would oblige . this in turn has created further friction as the german government has made it clear that it would not expect to pay for the added security at the world cup and that it would pass the bill to fifa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bird flu : the continuing threat germany 's media tangle with bird flu bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion the westward migration of bird flu bird flu vaccine on the way ? current affairs -pipe- 11.02.2006 bird flu : the facts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 strain of avian influenza poses a major threat to world health the deadly h5n1 bird flu virus has been confirmed within the european union 's borders for the first time with cases in italy and greece .
here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .
the mutation could occur if h5n1 co-infects a human who already has ordinary flu or the agent is picked up from poultry by an animal such as a pig that can carry both bird and regular flu strains . past pandemics : the 20th century saw three flu pandemics , in 1918-19 , 1957-58 and 1968-69 .
the 1918-19 pandemic killed as many as 50 million people - larger than the death toll from aids in more than two decades .
jet travel , the world 's huge population today and the larger number of people with compromised immune systems -lrb- from hiv and cancer , for instance -rrb- compared with 1918 could contribute to a far heavier toll . economic cost : a global pandemic of any scale would cost hundreds of billions of dollars because of the disruption to economic life .
the world bank estimates a bill of $ 550 billion -lrb- 465 billion euros -rrb- for rich countries alone .
the asian development bank -lrb- adb -rrb- estimates costs for asia ranging from $ 99 billion to $ 283 billion .
as a comparison , severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which killed fewer than 800 people in its 2003 outbreak , cost more than $ 30 billion . veterinary controls : these are the time-honored first line of defense in any outbreak of animal disease .
the task is to identify farms where there is an outbreak of h5n1 , quarantine the area , kill all fowl suspected to be in contact with it , disinfect machinery , vehicles and clothing , and bar sales of poultry products from the affected region .
but these controls are only really dependable if a country has a good surveillance network and responds quickly and effectively to an outbreak .
adequate compensation , too , is essential for encouraging honest reporting by farmers . counter-measures : an international conference in beijing drew more than $ 1.9 billion dollars in pledges to help fight bird flu , after experts estimated that around that amount would be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defenses .
an action plan drawn up in november stresses greater veterinary surveillance to detect outbreaks , preventative vaccination of poultry , culling of infected flocks and compensation for farmers .
its other focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . vaccine : no definitive vaccine against the viral threat is available as no one knows the precise shape the virus would take after mutating .
several prototypes are being explored .
but the risk is that they could be only partially effective or even useless because the genetic shape of the virus will have changed and thus will not be recognized by antibodies .
if a pandemic does occur , the big concern is about the delay .
it could take up to six months to formulate and test the right vaccine , which will only be available in limited quantities immediately thereafter .
traditionally , flu vaccines take up to nine months to manufacture , using egg-based technology , although ways of speeding this up using genetic " reverse engineering " are being intensively explored . drug arsenal : the range of antiviral drugs is small , but especially so when it comes to bird flu .
only two are considered effective against h5n1 : zanamivir -lrb- commercialized as relenza -rrb- and oseltamivir -lrb- tamiflu -rrb- .
these medications are called neuraminidase inhibitors , which block the virus from replicating .
if taken within a couple of days of the onset of illness , they can ease the severity of some symptoms and reduce the duration of sickness .
the who recommends that countries stockpile antivirals , but does not give a figure as to how big that stockpile should be .
it hopes to have its own stockpile , sufficient for three million people , by early 2006 .
a looming worry is whether the shifting virus might become resistant to tamiflu . sources : who , us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- , us national institutes of health -lrb- nih -rrb- , world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , nature , british medical journal -lrb- bmj -rrb- , the lancet , new england journal of medicine -lrb- nejm -rrb- , us department of health and human resources , news reports . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the continuing threat dw-world 's dossier of articles on the bird flu threat to europe .

it 's the first time the deadly virus has been detected in the eu . the h5n1 strain of bird flu which is potentially deadly for humans has reached the european union , having been detected in members greece and italy as well as in bulgaria , officials said saturday . italian health minister francesco storace said the highly pathogenic strain , responsible for the deaths of some 90 people , mainly in asia , had been found in two dead swans on the island of sicily and was suspected in at least half-a-dozen birds elsewhere in the south of the country . the eu commission in brussels for its part said that italian authorities " confirmed outbreaks of h5n1 on the eastern coast of sicily , in taranto -lrb- puglia -rrb- and in calabria . " storace said a total of 17 swans had been found dead in sicily as well as the calabria and puglia regions , of which at least half were carrying a flu virus . no human infection from wild birds , assures minister storace tried to calm fears by saying that so far no one had caught the virus directly from wild birds .
all the human cases so far have been contracted from domestic poultry infected by wild birds . " we are relatively unworried as regards human health but there are reasons for concern for animal health , " he said . storace was to sign an order banning for 20 days all transport of living domestic animals that may be infected by the virus in the three affected regions . the measures being applied by italy are the establishment of a high-risk area -lrb- three-kilometer protection zone -rrb- around each of the outbreaks and a surrounding surveillance zone of 10 kilometers -lrb- 6.2 miles -rrb- , the european commission said . in the protection zone , poultry must be kept indoors , movement of poultry is banned except directly to the slaughterhouse and the dispatch of meat outside the zone is forbidden except where products have undergone the controls provided for in eu food controls legislation . in both the protection zone and the surveillance zone , on-farm biosecurity measures must be strengthened , hunting of wild birds is banned and disease awareness of poultry owners and their families must be carried out , the commission said . greece 's swan deaths link to h5n1 confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of infection in greece , first aroused in october , have now been realized the measures have already been agreed by greece following the discovery of dead swans in the northern salonika region , which were confirmed saturday to have been carrying h5n1 . a goose infected with the h5 bird flu virus was also found on the aegean island of skyros but it was not yet known if it was the h5n1 strain . " in all regions where the h5 or h5n1 virus is detected planned preventative steps are enforced by official health authorities ; therefore there is no reason to take new measures , " the greek agriculture ministry said , warning against panicking as no poultry farms had been affected . fresh outbreaks in bulgaria , romania in brussels the european commission said the h5n1 strain had also been found in wild swans in the bulgarian wetland region of vidin , close to the romanian border , last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are investigating the return of the h5n1 virus to the danube delta in romania , health officials on saturday ordered tests after a possible new case of bird flu of the h5 strain was detected at a farm in the danube delta , the agriculture ministry said .
culling of poultry in sarina suf began saturday morning . the avian influenza situation in italy and other affected countries will be reviewed by the eu 's standing committee on the food and chain and animal health which meets thursday and friday . meanwhile in moscow , group of eight industrial powers warned saturday of the risk of a bird flu pandemic . detection of the virus within the european union appeared to show an alarmingly rapid spread of the disease , which was also confirmed in the past week to have crossed into africa for the first time . fears of rapid , unrestrained spread across africa " we call on the donor community to provide financial support to poor countries fighting the epidemic , " said a g8 statement issued after finance ministers wrapped up talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " highly pathogenic " strain of the h5n1 virus has been found in poultry stocks in nigeria nigeria announced wednesday africa 's first infections with the h5n1 strain . the spread of the disease to africa has led to fears it may run wild , infecting more people and providing more opportunities for the virus to mutate into a form able to jump from human to human . the h5n1 strain of bird flu found in nigerian poultry is the same virus previously detected in turkey , europe and china , which suggests it was brought to west africa by migrant birds , an expert with the world organization for animal health said friday . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion an international bird flu conference was hailed a huge success after it wrapped up wednesday with donor countries and organizations pledging $ 1.9 billion -lrb- 1.6 billion euros -rrb- to fight the killer virus .

the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .

it 's the first time the deadly virus has been detected in the eu . the h5n1 strain of bird flu which is potentially deadly for humans has reached the european union , having been detected in members greece and italy as well as in bulgaria , officials said saturday . italian health minister francesco storace said the highly pathogenic strain , responsible for the deaths of some 90 people , mainly in asia , had been found in two dead swans on the island of sicily and was suspected in at least half-a-dozen birds elsewhere in the south of the country . the eu commission in brussels for its part said that italian authorities " confirmed outbreaks of h5n1 on the eastern coast of sicily , in taranto -lrb- puglia -rrb- and in calabria . " storace said a total of 17 swans had been found dead in sicily as well as the calabria and puglia regions , of which at least half were carrying a flu virus . no human infection from wild birds , assures minister storace tried to calm fears by saying that so far no one had caught the virus directly from wild birds .
all the human cases so far have been contracted from domestic poultry infected by wild birds . " we are relatively unworried as regards human health but there are reasons for concern for animal health , " he said . storace was to sign an order banning for 20 days all transport of living domestic animals that may be infected by the virus in the three affected regions . the measures being applied by italy are the establishment of a high-risk area -lrb- three-kilometer protection zone -rrb- around each of the outbreaks and a surrounding surveillance zone of 10 kilometers -lrb- 6.2 miles -rrb- , the european commission said . in the protection zone , poultry must be kept indoors , movement of poultry is banned except directly to the slaughterhouse and the dispatch of meat outside the zone is forbidden except where products have undergone the controls provided for in eu food controls legislation . in both the protection zone and the surveillance zone , on-farm biosecurity measures must be strengthened , hunting of wild birds is banned and disease awareness of poultry owners and their families must be carried out , the commission said . greece 's swan deaths link to h5n1 confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of infection in greece , first aroused in october , have now been realized the measures have already been agreed by greece following the discovery of dead swans in the northern salonika region , which were confirmed saturday to have been carrying h5n1 . a goose infected with the h5 bird flu virus was also found on the aegean island of skyros but it was not yet known if it was the h5n1 strain . " in all regions where the h5 or h5n1 virus is detected planned preventative steps are enforced by official health authorities ; therefore there is no reason to take new measures , " the greek agriculture ministry said , warning against panicking as no poultry farms had been affected . fresh outbreaks in bulgaria , romania in brussels the european commission said the h5n1 strain had also been found in wild swans in the bulgarian wetland region of vidin , close to the romanian border , last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are investigating the return of the h5n1 virus to the danube delta in romania , health officials on saturday ordered tests after a possible new case of bird flu of the h5 strain was detected at a farm in the danube delta , the agriculture ministry said .
culling of poultry in sarina suf began saturday morning . the avian influenza situation in italy and other affected countries will be reviewed by the eu 's standing committee on the food and chain and animal health which meets thursday and friday . meanwhile in moscow , group of eight industrial powers warned saturday of the risk of a bird flu pandemic . detection of the virus within the european union appeared to show an alarmingly rapid spread of the disease , which was also confirmed in the past week to have crossed into africa for the first time . fears of rapid , unrestrained spread across africa " we call on the donor community to provide financial support to poor countries fighting the epidemic , " said a g8 statement issued after finance ministers wrapped up talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " highly pathogenic " strain of the h5n1 virus has been found in poultry stocks in nigeria nigeria announced wednesday africa 's first infections with the h5n1 strain . the spread of the disease to africa has led to fears it may run wild , infecting more people and providing more opportunities for the virus to mutate into a form able to jump from human to human . the h5n1 strain of bird flu found in nigerian poultry is the same virus previously detected in turkey , europe and china , which suggests it was brought to west africa by migrant birds , an expert with the world organization for animal health said friday . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion an international bird flu conference was hailed a huge success after it wrapped up wednesday with donor countries and organizations pledging $ 1.9 billion -lrb- 1.6 billion euros -rrb- to fight the killer virus .

here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .
the mutation could occur if h5n1 co-infects a human who already has ordinary flu or the agent is picked up from poultry by an animal such as a pig that can carry both bird and regular flu strains . past pandemics : the 20th century saw three flu pandemics , in 1918-19 , 1957-58 and 1968-69 .
the 1918-19 pandemic killed as many as 50 million people - larger than the death toll from aids in more than two decades .
jet travel , the world 's huge population today and the larger number of people with compromised immune systems -lrb- from hiv and cancer , for instance -rrb- compared with 1918 could contribute to a far heavier toll . economic cost : a global pandemic of any scale would cost hundreds of billions of dollars because of the disruption to economic life .
the world bank estimates a bill of $ 550 billion -lrb- 465 billion euros -rrb- for rich countries alone .
the asian development bank -lrb- adb -rrb- estimates costs for asia ranging from $ 99 billion to $ 283 billion .
as a comparison , severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which killed fewer than 800 people in its 2003 outbreak , cost more than $ 30 billion . veterinary controls : these are the time-honored first line of defense in any outbreak of animal disease .
the task is to identify farms where there is an outbreak of h5n1 , quarantine the area , kill all fowl suspected to be in contact with it , disinfect machinery , vehicles and clothing , and bar sales of poultry products from the affected region .
but these controls are only really dependable if a country has a good surveillance network and responds quickly and effectively to an outbreak .
adequate compensation , too , is essential for encouraging honest reporting by farmers . counter-measures : an international conference in beijing drew more than $ 1.9 billion dollars in pledges to help fight bird flu , after experts estimated that around that amount would be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defenses .
an action plan drawn up in november stresses greater veterinary surveillance to detect outbreaks , preventative vaccination of poultry , culling of infected flocks and compensation for farmers .
its other focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . vaccine : no definitive vaccine against the viral threat is available as no one knows the precise shape the virus would take after mutating .
several prototypes are being explored .
but the risk is that they could be only partially effective or even useless because the genetic shape of the virus will have changed and thus will not be recognized by antibodies .
if a pandemic does occur , the big concern is about the delay .

here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.02.2006 germany 's labor unions inflate their worth , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers believe they still have strong public support , but analysts are n't so sure confident public service workers are on strike and heavy industry workers want big pay increases .
but do unions have the clout to make significant demands of employers ? garbage collectors , hospital staffers and child care workers in one of germany 's 16 states went out on strike this week as union bosses warned that civil service workers across the country may join the work stoppage next week .
it 's the first big public sector walkout in 14 years .
the dispute centers on the push by governments to increase the average employee work week from 38.5 to 40 hours without a corresponding increase in pay .
" without compensation for the extra hours , we 're not going to do it , " said one worker preparing to picket outside of a stuttgart government building . the public service workers believe they have the public on their side , even if much of the private sector in germany has already moved to 40 hours of work per week . wro n g issue at the wro n g time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unions see increasing profits in the private sector as cause to make significant new demands hilmar schneider , director of labor policy at bonn 's institute for the study of labor in bonn , believes the union representing the workers , ver.di , has gone too far . " the issue is 18 minutes per day working without being compensated , " schneider said . " is it really worth going on strike for the first time in 14 years ? " however , ursula engelen-kefer , deputy director of the federation of german trade unions , asked whether it is really worth it for state and local governments " to provoke such a big conflict over 18 minutes ? " engelen-kefer is tracking the public sector labor conflict , noting similarities with moves by private companies in search of profits which are trying to gain more concessions from unions .
some analysts have given credit to german workers for responding to globalization pressures by accepting lower wage increases and longer working hours than other european countries .
german jobs have been saved as a result , they say .
but a number of german companies have posted record profits recently .
those profits have led some unions to include significant wage increases in their strategic plans for upcoming negotiations . " it 's a clear cut division in society between those who have the benefits , who are very small in numbers and are very exclusive , while more and more parts of the population have to bear all of the sarcrifices , " engelen-kefer said . decli n i n g u n io n stre n gth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers have made major concessions to employers in recent years to ensure their jobs stay put .
labor union membership numbers have fallen dramatically in the last decade , however , and the general strength of germany 's unions has been in decline . labor market watcher schneider wonders if there is too much nostalgia for the days of the four and a half day work week and the guaranteed 30 days of vacation .
previously common worker benefits were mandated by the government , not by negotiations between workers and employers .
" so unions did n't have to a hard life , " schneider said .
" they could concentrate on wage negotiations , but did n't have to talk about special programs for older workers or lay off protection .
but that has changed now . " short-term victories schneider reckons there are tough times ahead for germany 's unions .
he thinks he knows exactly where the present labor action in the public sector is likely to go .
first , the german people will be angry about civil servants going on strike , schneider believes , in part because of their perceived safe and cushy jobs .
but once garbage begins to pile up , or snow remains on the streets , " it 's only a matter of days before the people turn their anger from those who are striking to those who are preventing the strike from coming to an end , " schneider said .
government employers " will be forced to make some offers to the unions . " but unions should not expect that any success in coming days will lay meaningful groundwork for future victories , schneider warned .
he added that germany 's younger generations have already gotten the message regarding a completely different labor environment than the type enjoyed by their parents and grandparents . kyle mckinnon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?
after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects .

but do unions have the clout to make significant demands of employers ? garbage collectors , hospital staffers and child care workers in one of germany 's 16 states went out on strike this week as union bosses warned that civil service workers across the country may join the work stoppage next week .
it 's the first big public sector walkout in 14 years .
the dispute centers on the push by governments to increase the average employee work week from 38.5 to 40 hours without a corresponding increase in pay .
" without compensation for the extra hours , we 're not going to do it , " said one worker preparing to picket outside of a stuttgart government building . the public service workers believe they have the public on their side , even if much of the private sector in germany has already moved to 40 hours of work per week . wro n g issue at the wro n g time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unions see increasing profits in the private sector as cause to make significant new demands hilmar schneider , director of labor policy at bonn 's institute for the study of labor in bonn , believes the union representing the workers , ver.di , has gone too far . " the issue is 18 minutes per day working without being compensated , " schneider said . " is it really worth going on strike for the first time in 14 years ? " however , ursula engelen-kefer , deputy director of the federation of german trade unions , asked whether it is really worth it for state and local governments " to provoke such a big conflict over 18 minutes ? " engelen-kefer is tracking the public sector labor conflict , noting similarities with moves by private companies in search of profits which are trying to gain more concessions from unions .
some analysts have given credit to german workers for responding to globalization pressures by accepting lower wage increases and longer working hours than other european countries .
german jobs have been saved as a result , they say .
but a number of german companies have posted record profits recently .
those profits have led some unions to include significant wage increases in their strategic plans for upcoming negotiations . " it 's a clear cut division in society between those who have the benefits , who are very small in numbers and are very exclusive , while more and more parts of the population have to bear all of the sarcrifices , " engelen-kefer said . decli n i n g u n io n stre n gth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers have made major concessions to employers in recent years to ensure their jobs stay put .
labor union membership numbers have fallen dramatically in the last decade , however , and the general strength of germany 's unions has been in decline . labor market watcher schneider wonders if there is too much nostalgia for the days of the four and a half day work week and the guaranteed 30 days of vacation .
previously common worker benefits were mandated by the government , not by negotiations between workers and employers .
" so unions did n't have to a hard life , " schneider said .
" they could concentrate on wage negotiations , but did n't have to talk about special programs for older workers or lay off protection .
but that has changed now . " short-term victories schneider reckons there are tough times ahead for germany 's unions .
he thinks he knows exactly where the present labor action in the public sector is likely to go .
first , the german people will be angry about civil servants going on strike , schneider believes , in part because of their perceived safe and cushy jobs .
but once garbage begins to pile up , or snow remains on the streets , " it 's only a matter of days before the people turn their anger from those who are striking to those who are preventing the strike from coming to an end , " schneider said .
government employers " will be forced to make some offers to the unions . " but unions should not expect that any success in coming days will lay meaningful groundwork for future victories , schneider warned .
he added that germany 's younger generations have already gotten the message regarding a completely different labor environment than the type enjoyed by their parents and grandparents . kyle mckinnon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

" i want to remain an eternal mystery to myself and others , " ludwig once told his governess , and it is this mysterious element that adds to the buildings grandeur .

linderhof palace with its venus grotto , moorish kiosk and moroccan house meanwhile , was the monarch 's play castle - a bit like michael jackson 's neverland ranch . but it is neuschwanstein that sums up ludwig 's tenuous grip on real life and the magical madness that led to the creation of one of europe 's most iconic castles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de palatial digs in bavaria up for grabs if you 've ever imagined living in a converted castle , now 's your chance .

" i 've said clearly that we will act along the lines of our constitution , " he said . jung 's comments came a day after a newspaper article quoted an official defense ministry report as saying that at least 2,000 german soldiers including specialist biological warfare units would be mobilized for the world cup finals the süddeutsche zeitung claimed that the soldiers , who are trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical attacks , would be stationed in each of the 12 cities where the matches will take place while two transport helicopters used to carry injured or wounded people will be based in laupheim in southern germany and in bückeburg in the northwest . it also stated that the army would erect an emergency surgical hospital in the western city of kaiserslautern and build a control tower for special flights at stuttgart airport in the south . the measures would cost around five million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- , of which 1.4 million euros would be covered by the german government and the federal states .
several opposition politicians and member of the social democrats have suggested that fifa , world soccer 's governing body , should foot the bill . domestic defense deployment unconstitutional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany army has served on home soil but not in a security role in theory , the measures would not constitute a domestic deployment of the german army which is banned by the country 's constitution , drawn up in 1945 after the fall of the third reich . hitler 's use of the wehrmacht before and during world war ii effectively turned nazi germany into a police state .
to use the army in a domestic defense capability would need a change to the constitution , something most german politicians are very wary of considering the lessons of the mid-20th century . supporters of the plan to deploy the modern day bundeswehr as security at the world cup say that this is all ancient history and that what applied to germany 60 years ago is irrelevant as the country , as host of the world 's largest single sports event , faces other challenges , including terrorism and hooligans . despite jung 's assertion that the bundeswehr will not be used , campaigners for the use of the german army at the world cup showed they had not been defeated in a parliamentary session on friday . schäuble 's plan takes a different tack to avoid all-out rejection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has another trick up his sleeve conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble 's proposal to change the constitution to allow the bundeswehr to be deployed on home soil was once again given an airing in the bundestag and was once again , for the time being at least , suspended . a constitutional change would require a two-thirds majority vote in favor ; a decision which at the present time seems unlikely .
but schäuble 's spokesperson stefan kaller told parliament that german soldiers could be used in a domestic security capacity if individual soldiers were deputized as police officers , allowing them to be used in the protection of buildings and other sensitive sites . the christian democratic union 's wolfgang bosbach announced shortly after that the application for the use of the deployment of the bundeswehr would be debated and decided upon " quickly " given the new alternatives to a constitutional change . opinions divided on bundeswehr world cup mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some oppose the deployment , others believe it would help the overstretched police force the ideas of deploying and / or deputizing soldiers were again met with opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 11.02.2006 germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany welcomes the world : soccer fans may still face german soldiers at the world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets . after raging for months , the debate over whether the german armed forces will be used to boost security at this summer 's world cup soccer championships appeared to be closed by german defense minister franz josef jung on friday . jung , who was attending the nato meeting in the sicilian town of taormina this week , told reporters that all security measures other than the army will be used for the tournament which will run from june 9 to july 9 . " i 've said clearly that we will act along the lines of our constitution , " he said . jung 's comments came a day after a newspaper article quoted an official defense ministry report as saying that at least 2,000 german soldiers including specialist biological warfare units would be mobilized for the world cup finals the süddeutsche zeitung claimed that the soldiers , who are trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical attacks , would be stationed in each of the 12 cities where the matches will take place while two transport helicopters used to carry injured or wounded people will be based in laupheim in southern germany and in bückeburg in the northwest . it also stated that the army would erect an emergency surgical hospital in the western city of kaiserslautern and build a control tower for special flights at stuttgart airport in the south . the measures would cost around five million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- , of which 1.4 million euros would be covered by the german government and the federal states .
several opposition politicians and member of the social democrats have suggested that fifa , world soccer 's governing body , should foot the bill . domestic defense deployment unconstitutional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany army has served on home soil but not in a security role in theory , the measures would not constitute a domestic deployment of the german army which is banned by the country 's constitution , drawn up in 1945 after the fall of the third reich . hitler 's use of the wehrmacht before and during world war ii effectively turned nazi germany into a police state .
to use the army in a domestic defense capability would need a change to the constitution , something most german politicians are very wary of considering the lessons of the mid-20th century . supporters of the plan to deploy the modern day bundeswehr as security at the world cup say that this is all ancient history and that what applied to germany 60 years ago is irrelevant as the country , as host of the world 's largest single sports event , faces other challenges , including terrorism and hooligans . despite jung 's assertion that the bundeswehr will not be used , campaigners for the use of the german army at the world cup showed they had not been defeated in a parliamentary session on friday . schäuble 's plan takes a different tack to avoid all-out rejection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has another trick up his sleeve conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble 's proposal to change the constitution to allow the bundeswehr to be deployed on home soil was once again given an airing in the bundestag and was once again , for the time being at least , suspended . a constitutional change would require a two-thirds majority vote in favor ; a decision which at the present time seems unlikely .
but schäuble 's spokesperson stefan kaller told parliament that german soldiers could be used in a domestic security capacity if individual soldiers were deputized as police officers , allowing them to be used in the protection of buildings and other sensitive sites . the christian democratic union 's wolfgang bosbach announced shortly after that the application for the use of the deployment of the bundeswehr would be debated and decided upon " quickly " given the new alternatives to a constitutional change . opinions divided on bundeswehr world cup mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some oppose the deployment , others believe it would help the overstretched police force the ideas of deploying and / or deputizing soldiers were again met with opposition .
social democrat dieter wiefelspütz from the interior ministry told the bundestag that the constitution would not be changed while schleswig-holstein 's minister of the interior ralf stegner warned about the " militarization of internal security . " the debate continues to rage as germany 's policing capacities bend under the strain of dealing with multiple threats and challenges even before the tournament begins . for months , the organizers of the world cup have been working on comprehensive security plans to protect spectators , players and vips from around the world . under these plans , germany 's police force will be stretched very thin , a situation which has added extra weight to the argument for a domestic deployment of the army . public opinion in germany is pretty much evenly divided over the issue with some arguing that the army could easily be used to guard key buildings and would not have to be deployed in high profile areas , like stadiums or entertainment districts . others point out that the army is not trained for public security operations and lacks the necessary sensitivity in dealing with such encounters .
both may be right , but as günther beckstein , bavaria 's interior minister , argued , using the armed forces would take some of the pressure off the police . " all measures by the army to assume duties , like the protection of property , would free up hundreds of police for actual police work , " the christian social union politician said . nato ready to help , germany unwilling to pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : awacs planes will be available to germany , and fifa will be expected to pay armed forces , not specifically the german army , have already been penciled in for security duties at the world cup with nato officials declaring recently that the alliance fully expects to be called upon by the german government to provide awacs surveillance planes at the world cup , a request that nato would oblige . this in turn has created further friction as the german government has made it clear that it would not expect to pay for the added security at the world cup and that it would pass the bill to fifa .
soccer officials are less than happy about the prospect of having to stump up the cash to hire nato planes and possibly pay for further measures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians divided over army deployment for world cup as germany prepares to host the soccer world cup next year , security concerns are looming large .

but do unions have the clout to make significant demands of employers ? garbage collectors , hospital staffers and child care workers in one of germany 's 16 states went out on strike this week as union bosses warned that civil service workers across the country may join the work stoppage next week .
it 's the first big public sector walkout in 14 years .
the dispute centers on the push by governments to increase the average employee work week from 38.5 to 40 hours without a corresponding increase in pay .
" without compensation for the extra hours , we 're not going to do it , " said one worker preparing to picket outside of a stuttgart government building . the public service workers believe they have the public on their side , even if much of the private sector in germany has already moved to 40 hours of work per week . wro n g issue at the wro n g time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unions see increasing profits in the private sector as cause to make significant new demands hilmar schneider , director of labor policy at bonn 's institute for the study of labor in bonn , believes the union representing the workers , ver.di , has gone too far . " the issue is 18 minutes per day working without being compensated , " schneider said . " is it really worth going on strike for the first time in 14 years ? " however , ursula engelen-kefer , deputy director of the federation of german trade unions , asked whether it is really worth it for state and local governments " to provoke such a big conflict over 18 minutes ? " engelen-kefer is tracking the public sector labor conflict , noting similarities with moves by private companies in search of profits which are trying to gain more concessions from unions .
some analysts have given credit to german workers for responding to globalization pressures by accepting lower wage increases and longer working hours than other european countries .
german jobs have been saved as a result , they say .
but a number of german companies have posted record profits recently .
those profits have led some unions to include significant wage increases in their strategic plans for upcoming negotiations . " it 's a clear cut division in society between those who have the benefits , who are very small in numbers and are very exclusive , while more and more parts of the population have to bear all of the sarcrifices , " engelen-kefer said . decli n i n g u n io n stre n gth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers have made major concessions to employers in recent years to ensure their jobs stay put .
labor union membership numbers have fallen dramatically in the last decade , however , and the general strength of germany 's unions has been in decline . labor market watcher schneider wonders if there is too much nostalgia for the days of the four and a half day work week and the guaranteed 30 days of vacation .
previously common worker benefits were mandated by the government , not by negotiations between workers and employers .
" so unions did n't have to a hard life , " schneider said .
" they could concentrate on wage negotiations , but did n't have to talk about special programs for older workers or lay off protection .
but that has changed now . " short-term victories schneider reckons there are tough times ahead for germany 's unions .
he thinks he knows exactly where the present labor action in the public sector is likely to go .
first , the german people will be angry about civil servants going on strike , schneider believes , in part because of their perceived safe and cushy jobs .
but once garbage begins to pile up , or snow remains on the streets , " it 's only a matter of days before the people turn their anger from those who are striking to those who are preventing the strike from coming to an end , " schneider said .
government employers " will be forced to make some offers to the unions . " but unions should not expect that any success in coming days will lay meaningful groundwork for future victories , schneider warned .
he added that germany 's younger generations have already gotten the message regarding a completely different labor environment than the type enjoyed by their parents and grandparents . kyle mckinnon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

" the debate continues to rage as germany 's policing capacities bend under the strain of dealing with multiple threats and challenges even before the tournament begins . for months , the organizers of the world cup have been working on comprehensive security plans to protect spectators , players and vips from around the world . under these plans , germany 's police force will be stretched very thin , a situation which has added extra weight to the argument for a domestic deployment of the army . public opinion in germany is pretty much evenly divided over the issue with some arguing that the army could easily be used to guard key buildings and would not have to be deployed in high profile areas , like stadiums or entertainment districts . others point out that the army is not trained for public security operations and lacks the necessary sensitivity in dealing with such encounters .
both may be right , but as günther beckstein , bavaria 's interior minister , argued , using the armed forces would take some of the pressure off the police . " all measures by the army to assume duties , like the protection of property , would free up hundreds of police for actual police work , " the christian social union politician said . nato ready to help , germany unwilling to pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : awacs planes will be available to germany , and fifa will be expected to pay armed forces , not specifically the german army , have already been penciled in for security duties at the world cup with nato officials declaring recently that the alliance fully expects to be called upon by the german government to provide awacs surveillance planes at the world cup , a request that nato would oblige . this in turn has created further friction as the german government has made it clear that it would not expect to pay for the added security at the world cup and that it would pass the bill to fifa .
soccer officials are less than happy about the prospect of having to stump up the cash to hire nato planes and possibly pay for further measures . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians divided over army deployment for world cup as germany prepares to host the soccer world cup next year , security concerns are looming large .

here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .
the mutation could occur if h5n1 co-infects a human who already has ordinary flu or the agent is picked up from poultry by an animal such as a pig that can carry both bird and regular flu strains . past pandemics : the 20th century saw three flu pandemics , in 1918-19 , 1957-58 and 1968-69 .
the 1918-19 pandemic killed as many as 50 million people - larger than the death toll from aids in more than two decades .
jet travel , the world 's huge population today and the larger number of people with compromised immune systems -lrb- from hiv and cancer , for instance -rrb- compared with 1918 could contribute to a far heavier toll . economic cost : a global pandemic of any scale would cost hundreds of billions of dollars because of the disruption to economic life .
the world bank estimates a bill of $ 550 billion -lrb- 465 billion euros -rrb- for rich countries alone .
the asian development bank -lrb- adb -rrb- estimates costs for asia ranging from $ 99 billion to $ 283 billion .
as a comparison , severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which killed fewer than 800 people in its 2003 outbreak , cost more than $ 30 billion . veterinary controls : these are the time-honored first line of defense in any outbreak of animal disease .
the task is to identify farms where there is an outbreak of h5n1 , quarantine the area , kill all fowl suspected to be in contact with it , disinfect machinery , vehicles and clothing , and bar sales of poultry products from the affected region .
but these controls are only really dependable if a country has a good surveillance network and responds quickly and effectively to an outbreak .
adequate compensation , too , is essential for encouraging honest reporting by farmers . counter-measures : an international conference in beijing drew more than $ 1.9 billion dollars in pledges to help fight bird flu , after experts estimated that around that amount would be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defenses .
an action plan drawn up in november stresses greater veterinary surveillance to detect outbreaks , preventative vaccination of poultry , culling of infected flocks and compensation for farmers .
its other focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . vaccine : no definitive vaccine against the viral threat is available as no one knows the precise shape the virus would take after mutating .
several prototypes are being explored .
but the risk is that they could be only partially effective or even useless because the genetic shape of the virus will have changed and thus will not be recognized by antibodies .
if a pandemic does occur , the big concern is about the delay .
it could take up to six months to formulate and test the right vaccine , which will only be available in limited quantities immediately thereafter .
traditionally , flu vaccines take up to nine months to manufacture , using egg-based technology , although ways of speeding this up using genetic " reverse engineering " are being intensively explored . drug arsenal : the range of antiviral drugs is small , but especially so when it comes to bird flu .
only two are considered effective against h5n1 : zanamivir -lrb- commercialized as relenza -rrb- and oseltamivir -lrb- tamiflu -rrb- .
these medications are called neuraminidase inhibitors , which block the virus from replicating .
if taken within a couple of days of the onset of illness , they can ease the severity of some symptoms and reduce the duration of sickness .
the who recommends that countries stockpile antivirals , but does not give a figure as to how big that stockpile should be .
it hopes to have its own stockpile , sufficient for three million people , by early 2006 .

here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .
the mutation could occur if h5n1 co-infects a human who already has ordinary flu or the agent is picked up from poultry by an animal such as a pig that can carry both bird and regular flu strains . past pandemics : the 20th century saw three flu pandemics , in 1918-19 , 1957-58 and 1968-69 .
the 1918-19 pandemic killed as many as 50 million people - larger than the death toll from aids in more than two decades .
jet travel , the world 's huge population today and the larger number of people with compromised immune systems -lrb- from hiv and cancer , for instance -rrb- compared with 1918 could contribute to a far heavier toll . economic cost : a global pandemic of any scale would cost hundreds of billions of dollars because of the disruption to economic life .
the world bank estimates a bill of $ 550 billion -lrb- 465 billion euros -rrb- for rich countries alone .
the asian development bank -lrb- adb -rrb- estimates costs for asia ranging from $ 99 billion to $ 283 billion .
as a comparison , severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which killed fewer than 800 people in its 2003 outbreak , cost more than $ 30 billion . veterinary controls : these are the time-honored first line of defense in any outbreak of animal disease .
the task is to identify farms where there is an outbreak of h5n1 , quarantine the area , kill all fowl suspected to be in contact with it , disinfect machinery , vehicles and clothing , and bar sales of poultry products from the affected region .
but these controls are only really dependable if a country has a good surveillance network and responds quickly and effectively to an outbreak .
adequate compensation , too , is essential for encouraging honest reporting by farmers . counter-measures : an international conference in beijing drew more than $ 1.9 billion dollars in pledges to help fight bird flu , after experts estimated that around that amount would be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defenses .
an action plan drawn up in november stresses greater veterinary surveillance to detect outbreaks , preventative vaccination of poultry , culling of infected flocks and compensation for farmers .
its other focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . vaccine : no definitive vaccine against the viral threat is available as no one knows the precise shape the virus would take after mutating .
several prototypes are being explored .
but the risk is that they could be only partially effective or even useless because the genetic shape of the virus will have changed and thus will not be recognized by antibodies .
if a pandemic does occur , the big concern is about the delay .
it could take up to six months to formulate and test the right vaccine , which will only be available in limited quantities immediately thereafter .
traditionally , flu vaccines take up to nine months to manufacture , using egg-based technology , although ways of speeding this up using genetic " reverse engineering " are being intensively explored . drug arsenal : the range of antiviral drugs is small , but especially so when it comes to bird flu .
only two are considered effective against h5n1 : zanamivir -lrb- commercialized as relenza -rrb- and oseltamivir -lrb- tamiflu -rrb- .
these medications are called neuraminidase inhibitors , which block the virus from replicating .
if taken within a couple of days of the onset of illness , they can ease the severity of some symptoms and reduce the duration of sickness .
the who recommends that countries stockpile antivirals , but does not give a figure as to how big that stockpile should be .
it hopes to have its own stockpile , sufficient for three million people , by early 2006 .
a looming worry is whether the shifting virus might become resistant to tamiflu . sources : who , us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- , us national institutes of health -lrb- nih -rrb- , world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , nature , british medical journal -lrb- bmj -rrb- , the lancet , new england journal of medicine -lrb- nejm -rrb- , us department of health and human resources , news reports . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the continuing threat dw-world 's dossier of articles on the bird flu threat to europe .

but neuschwanstein and king ludwig ii 's other castles are more than an obligatory kitsch stop on a whirlwind tour . the fairy tale castle of neuschwanstein remains the focal point for most tourists traveling to germany to take in impressive scenery and architecture .
however , for those who want to experience more of the madness of king ludwig ii , there are several other of the monarch 's outlandish abodes and places of interest in the valley between ammergau and the allgäuer alps . but the king 's final home is really the big draw .

more than any other of his homes , neuschwanstein really shows what ludwig ii was trying to achieve when he had the castle built as his retreat from public life .

however , for those who want to experience more of the madness of king ludwig ii , there are several other of the monarch 's outlandish abodes and places of interest in the valley between ammergau and the allgäuer alps . but the king 's final home is really the big draw .
a walk of just 30 minutes takes the inquisitive traveler from schwangau to the world-famous castle .
if you can fight your way through the coach loads of tourists who always include the disney-inspiring royal domicile on their tours of central europe , you will see what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a castle built for privacy now gets over a million visitors a year every year 1.3 million people visit " the castle of the fairy-tale king " .
in the summer around 6,000 visitors a day stream through rooms that were intended for a single person . while visiting the castle as part of a tour of southern germany is as obligatory as getting sloshed at oktoberfest or the hofbräuhaus in munich , visiting rothenburg or heidelberg , there is a reason why it is an essential part of the agenda . after gaping at the dream-like beauty of the castle itself , the other-worldly nature of the interiors really start to capture the imagination .
more than any other of his homes , neuschwanstein really shows what ludwig ii was trying to achieve when he had the castle built as his retreat from public life .
ludwig escaped into a dream world in the castle - the poetic world of the middle ages – which can be seen in vivid colors throughout the extravagantly decorated rooms . wagner-inspired rooms provided an escape into a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swan from a legend that inspired wagner decorates ludwig 's private quarters the rooms are filled by picture cycles inspired by the operas of richard wagner , to whom the king dedicated the castle .
these decorations , while not directly modeled on wagner 's works , take in the medieval legends that the composer was inspired by and provided ludwig was an alternate reality in which to live out his final days in blissful insanity . " i want to remain an eternal mystery to myself and others , " ludwig once told his governess , and it is this mysterious element that adds to the buildings grandeur .
people flock to see where the shy king retreated to but also to imagine what it was like to lose one 's self in such surroundings , ludwig 's final refuge from reality . a life in castles his unconventional approach to his rule led him to build a number of outrageously intricate castles of various styles and sizes between ammergau and the allgäuer alps , each one telling a different chapter in the story of his weird and wonderful life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig was also drawn to the mysterious chiemsee lake in his father 's neo-gothic castle at hohenschwangau , for example , ludwig ii spent his formative years while the herrenchiemsee palace – a copy of the palace at versailles built on lake chiem – was created during a period when ludwig himself mirrored louis xiv 's dream of becoming not merely a king but a god .
linderhof palace with its venus grotto , moorish kiosk and moroccan house meanwhile , was the monarch 's play castle - a bit like michael jackson 's neverland ranch . but it is neuschwanstein that sums up ludwig 's tenuous grip on real life and the magical madness that led to the creation of one of europe 's most iconic castles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de palatial digs in bavaria up for grabs if you 've ever imagined living in a converted castle , now 's your chance .

here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .
the mutation could occur if h5n1 co-infects a human who already has ordinary flu or the agent is picked up from poultry by an animal such as a pig that can carry both bird and regular flu strains . past pandemics : the 20th century saw three flu pandemics , in 1918-19 , 1957-58 and 1968-69 .
the 1918-19 pandemic killed as many as 50 million people - larger than the death toll from aids in more than two decades .
jet travel , the world 's huge population today and the larger number of people with compromised immune systems -lrb- from hiv and cancer , for instance -rrb- compared with 1918 could contribute to a far heavier toll . economic cost : a global pandemic of any scale would cost hundreds of billions of dollars because of the disruption to economic life .
the world bank estimates a bill of $ 550 billion -lrb- 465 billion euros -rrb- for rich countries alone .
the asian development bank -lrb- adb -rrb- estimates costs for asia ranging from $ 99 billion to $ 283 billion .
as a comparison , severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which killed fewer than 800 people in its 2003 outbreak , cost more than $ 30 billion . veterinary controls : these are the time-honored first line of defense in any outbreak of animal disease .
the task is to identify farms where there is an outbreak of h5n1 , quarantine the area , kill all fowl suspected to be in contact with it , disinfect machinery , vehicles and clothing , and bar sales of poultry products from the affected region .
but these controls are only really dependable if a country has a good surveillance network and responds quickly and effectively to an outbreak .
adequate compensation , too , is essential for encouraging honest reporting by farmers . counter-measures : an international conference in beijing drew more than $ 1.9 billion dollars in pledges to help fight bird flu , after experts estimated that around that amount would be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defenses .
an action plan drawn up in november stresses greater veterinary surveillance to detect outbreaks , preventative vaccination of poultry , culling of infected flocks and compensation for farmers .
its other focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . vaccine : no definitive vaccine against the viral threat is available as no one knows the precise shape the virus would take after mutating .
several prototypes are being explored .
but the risk is that they could be only partially effective or even useless because the genetic shape of the virus will have changed and thus will not be recognized by antibodies .
if a pandemic does occur , the big concern is about the delay .
it could take up to six months to formulate and test the right vaccine , which will only be available in limited quantities immediately thereafter .
traditionally , flu vaccines take up to nine months to manufacture , using egg-based technology , although ways of speeding this up using genetic " reverse engineering " are being intensively explored . drug arsenal : the range of antiviral drugs is small , but especially so when it comes to bird flu .
only two are considered effective against h5n1 : zanamivir -lrb- commercialized as relenza -rrb- and oseltamivir -lrb- tamiflu -rrb- .
these medications are called neuraminidase inhibitors , which block the virus from replicating .
if taken within a couple of days of the onset of illness , they can ease the severity of some symptoms and reduce the duration of sickness .
the who recommends that countries stockpile antivirals , but does not give a figure as to how big that stockpile should be .
it hopes to have its own stockpile , sufficient for three million people , by early 2006 .
a looming worry is whether the shifting virus might become resistant to tamiflu . sources : who , us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- , us national institutes of health -lrb- nih -rrb- , world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , nature , british medical journal -lrb- bmj -rrb- , the lancet , new england journal of medicine -lrb- nejm -rrb- , us department of health and human resources , news reports . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the continuing threat dw-world 's dossier of articles on the bird flu threat to europe .

but neuschwanstein and king ludwig ii 's other castles are more than an obligatory kitsch stop on a whirlwind tour . the fairy tale castle of neuschwanstein remains the focal point for most tourists traveling to germany to take in impressive scenery and architecture .
however , for those who want to experience more of the madness of king ludwig ii , there are several other of the monarch 's outlandish abodes and places of interest in the valley between ammergau and the allgäuer alps . but the king 's final home is really the big draw .
a walk of just 30 minutes takes the inquisitive traveler from schwangau to the world-famous castle .
if you can fight your way through the coach loads of tourists who always include the disney-inspiring royal domicile on their tours of central europe , you will see what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a castle built for privacy now gets over a million visitors a year every year 1.3 million people visit " the castle of the fairy-tale king " .
in the summer around 6,000 visitors a day stream through rooms that were intended for a single person . while visiting the castle as part of a tour of southern germany is as obligatory as getting sloshed at oktoberfest or the hofbräuhaus in munich , visiting rothenburg or heidelberg , there is a reason why it is an essential part of the agenda . after gaping at the dream-like beauty of the castle itself , the other-worldly nature of the interiors really start to capture the imagination .
more than any other of his homes , neuschwanstein really shows what ludwig ii was trying to achieve when he had the castle built as his retreat from public life .
ludwig escaped into a dream world in the castle - the poetic world of the middle ages – which can be seen in vivid colors throughout the extravagantly decorated rooms . wagner-inspired rooms provided an escape into a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swan from a legend that inspired wagner decorates ludwig 's private quarters the rooms are filled by picture cycles inspired by the operas of richard wagner , to whom the king dedicated the castle .
these decorations , while not directly modeled on wagner 's works , take in the medieval legends that the composer was inspired by and provided ludwig was an alternate reality in which to live out his final days in blissful insanity . " i want to remain an eternal mystery to myself and others , " ludwig once told his governess , and it is this mysterious element that adds to the buildings grandeur .
people flock to see where the shy king retreated to but also to imagine what it was like to lose one 's self in such surroundings , ludwig 's final refuge from reality . a life in castles his unconventional approach to his rule led him to build a number of outrageously intricate castles of various styles and sizes between ammergau and the allgäuer alps , each one telling a different chapter in the story of his weird and wonderful life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig was also drawn to the mysterious chiemsee lake in his father 's neo-gothic castle at hohenschwangau , for example , ludwig ii spent his formative years while the herrenchiemsee palace – a copy of the palace at versailles built on lake chiem – was created during a period when ludwig himself mirrored louis xiv 's dream of becoming not merely a king but a god .
linderhof palace with its venus grotto , moorish kiosk and moroccan house meanwhile , was the monarch 's play castle - a bit like michael jackson 's neverland ranch . but it is neuschwanstein that sums up ludwig 's tenuous grip on real life and the magical madness that led to the creation of one of europe 's most iconic castles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de palatial digs in bavaria up for grabs if you 've ever imagined living in a converted castle , now 's your chance .

but do unions have the clout to make significant demands of employers ? garbage collectors , hospital staffers and child care workers in one of germany 's 16 states went out on strike this week as union bosses warned that civil service workers across the country may join the work stoppage next week .
it 's the first big public sector walkout in 14 years .
the dispute centers on the push by governments to increase the average employee work week from 38.5 to 40 hours without a corresponding increase in pay .
" without compensation for the extra hours , we 're not going to do it , " said one worker preparing to picket outside of a stuttgart government building . the public service workers believe they have the public on their side , even if much of the private sector in germany has already moved to 40 hours of work per week . wro n g issue at the wro n g time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unions see increasing profits in the private sector as cause to make significant new demands hilmar schneider , director of labor policy at bonn 's institute for the study of labor in bonn , believes the union representing the workers , ver.di , has gone too far . " the issue is 18 minutes per day working without being compensated , " schneider said . " is it really worth going on strike for the first time in 14 years ? " however , ursula engelen-kefer , deputy director of the federation of german trade unions , asked whether it is really worth it for state and local governments " to provoke such a big conflict over 18 minutes ? " engelen-kefer is tracking the public sector labor conflict , noting similarities with moves by private companies in search of profits which are trying to gain more concessions from unions .
some analysts have given credit to german workers for responding to globalization pressures by accepting lower wage increases and longer working hours than other european countries .
german jobs have been saved as a result , they say .
but a number of german companies have posted record profits recently .
those profits have led some unions to include significant wage increases in their strategic plans for upcoming negotiations . " it 's a clear cut division in society between those who have the benefits , who are very small in numbers and are very exclusive , while more and more parts of the population have to bear all of the sarcrifices , " engelen-kefer said . decli n i n g u n io n stre n gth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers have made major concessions to employers in recent years to ensure their jobs stay put .
labor union membership numbers have fallen dramatically in the last decade , however , and the general strength of germany 's unions has been in decline . labor market watcher schneider wonders if there is too much nostalgia for the days of the four and a half day work week and the guaranteed 30 days of vacation .
previously common worker benefits were mandated by the government , not by negotiations between workers and employers .
" so unions did n't have to a hard life , " schneider said .
" they could concentrate on wage negotiations , but did n't have to talk about special programs for older workers or lay off protection .
but that has changed now . " short-term victories schneider reckons there are tough times ahead for germany 's unions .
he thinks he knows exactly where the present labor action in the public sector is likely to go .
first , the german people will be angry about civil servants going on strike , schneider believes , in part because of their perceived safe and cushy jobs .
but once garbage begins to pile up , or snow remains on the streets , " it 's only a matter of days before the people turn their anger from those who are striking to those who are preventing the strike from coming to an end , " schneider said .
government employers " will be forced to make some offers to the unions . " but unions should not expect that any success in coming days will lay meaningful groundwork for future victories , schneider warned .

but do unions have the clout to make significant demands of employers ? garbage collectors , hospital staffers and child care workers in one of germany 's 16 states went out on strike this week as union bosses warned that civil service workers across the country may join the work stoppage next week .
it 's the first big public sector walkout in 14 years .
the dispute centers on the push by governments to increase the average employee work week from 38.5 to 40 hours without a corresponding increase in pay .
" without compensation for the extra hours , we 're not going to do it , " said one worker preparing to picket outside of a stuttgart government building . the public service workers believe they have the public on their side , even if much of the private sector in germany has already moved to 40 hours of work per week . wro n g issue at the wro n g time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unions see increasing profits in the private sector as cause to make significant new demands hilmar schneider , director of labor policy at bonn 's institute for the study of labor in bonn , believes the union representing the workers , ver.di , has gone too far . " the issue is 18 minutes per day working without being compensated , " schneider said . " is it really worth going on strike for the first time in 14 years ? " however , ursula engelen-kefer , deputy director of the federation of german trade unions , asked whether it is really worth it for state and local governments " to provoke such a big conflict over 18 minutes ? " engelen-kefer is tracking the public sector labor conflict , noting similarities with moves by private companies in search of profits which are trying to gain more concessions from unions .
some analysts have given credit to german workers for responding to globalization pressures by accepting lower wage increases and longer working hours than other european countries .
german jobs have been saved as a result , they say .
but a number of german companies have posted record profits recently .
those profits have led some unions to include significant wage increases in their strategic plans for upcoming negotiations . " it 's a clear cut division in society between those who have the benefits , who are very small in numbers and are very exclusive , while more and more parts of the population have to bear all of the sarcrifices , " engelen-kefer said . decli n i n g u n io n stre n gth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers have made major concessions to employers in recent years to ensure their jobs stay put .
labor union membership numbers have fallen dramatically in the last decade , however , and the general strength of germany 's unions has been in decline . labor market watcher schneider wonders if there is too much nostalgia for the days of the four and a half day work week and the guaranteed 30 days of vacation .
previously common worker benefits were mandated by the government , not by negotiations between workers and employers .
" so unions did n't have to a hard life , " schneider said .
" they could concentrate on wage negotiations , but did n't have to talk about special programs for older workers or lay off protection .
but that has changed now . " short-term victories schneider reckons there are tough times ahead for germany 's unions .
he thinks he knows exactly where the present labor action in the public sector is likely to go .
first , the german people will be angry about civil servants going on strike , schneider believes , in part because of their perceived safe and cushy jobs .
but once garbage begins to pile up , or snow remains on the streets , " it 's only a matter of days before the people turn their anger from those who are striking to those who are preventing the strike from coming to an end , " schneider said .
government employers " will be forced to make some offers to the unions . " but unions should not expect that any success in coming days will lay meaningful groundwork for future victories , schneider warned .
he added that germany 's younger generations have already gotten the message regarding a completely different labor environment than the type enjoyed by their parents and grandparents . kyle mckinnon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?

but neuschwanstein and king ludwig ii 's other castles are more than an obligatory kitsch stop on a whirlwind tour . the fairy tale castle of neuschwanstein remains the focal point for most tourists traveling to germany to take in impressive scenery and architecture .
however , for those who want to experience more of the madness of king ludwig ii , there are several other of the monarch 's outlandish abodes and places of interest in the valley between ammergau and the allgäuer alps . but the king 's final home is really the big draw .
a walk of just 30 minutes takes the inquisitive traveler from schwangau to the world-famous castle .
if you can fight your way through the coach loads of tourists who always include the disney-inspiring royal domicile on their tours of central europe , you will see what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a castle built for privacy now gets over a million visitors a year every year 1.3 million people visit " the castle of the fairy-tale king " .
in the summer around 6,000 visitors a day stream through rooms that were intended for a single person . while visiting the castle as part of a tour of southern germany is as obligatory as getting sloshed at oktoberfest or the hofbräuhaus in munich , visiting rothenburg or heidelberg , there is a reason why it is an essential part of the agenda . after gaping at the dream-like beauty of the castle itself , the other-worldly nature of the interiors really start to capture the imagination .
more than any other of his homes , neuschwanstein really shows what ludwig ii was trying to achieve when he had the castle built as his retreat from public life .
ludwig escaped into a dream world in the castle - the poetic world of the middle ages – which can be seen in vivid colors throughout the extravagantly decorated rooms . wagner-inspired rooms provided an escape into a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swan from a legend that inspired wagner decorates ludwig 's private quarters the rooms are filled by picture cycles inspired by the operas of richard wagner , to whom the king dedicated the castle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.02.2006 germany 's labor unions inflate their worth , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers believe they still have strong public support , but analysts are n't so sure confident public service workers are on strike and heavy industry workers want big pay increases .
but do unions have the clout to make significant demands of employers ? garbage collectors , hospital staffers and child care workers in one of germany 's 16 states went out on strike this week as union bosses warned that civil service workers across the country may join the work stoppage next week .
it 's the first big public sector walkout in 14 years .
the dispute centers on the push by governments to increase the average employee work week from 38.5 to 40 hours without a corresponding increase in pay .
" without compensation for the extra hours , we 're not going to do it , " said one worker preparing to picket outside of a stuttgart government building . the public service workers believe they have the public on their side , even if much of the private sector in germany has already moved to 40 hours of work per week . wro n g issue at the wro n g time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unions see increasing profits in the private sector as cause to make significant new demands hilmar schneider , director of labor policy at bonn 's institute for the study of labor in bonn , believes the union representing the workers , ver.di , has gone too far . " the issue is 18 minutes per day working without being compensated , " schneider said . " is it really worth going on strike for the first time in 14 years ? " however , ursula engelen-kefer , deputy director of the federation of german trade unions , asked whether it is really worth it for state and local governments " to provoke such a big conflict over 18 minutes ? " engelen-kefer is tracking the public sector labor conflict , noting similarities with moves by private companies in search of profits which are trying to gain more concessions from unions .
some analysts have given credit to german workers for responding to globalization pressures by accepting lower wage increases and longer working hours than other european countries .
german jobs have been saved as a result , they say .
but a number of german companies have posted record profits recently .
those profits have led some unions to include significant wage increases in their strategic plans for upcoming negotiations . " it 's a clear cut division in society between those who have the benefits , who are very small in numbers and are very exclusive , while more and more parts of the population have to bear all of the sarcrifices , " engelen-kefer said . decli n i n g u n io n stre n gth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers have made major concessions to employers in recent years to ensure their jobs stay put .
labor union membership numbers have fallen dramatically in the last decade , however , and the general strength of germany 's unions has been in decline . labor market watcher schneider wonders if there is too much nostalgia for the days of the four and a half day work week and the guaranteed 30 days of vacation .
previously common worker benefits were mandated by the government , not by negotiations between workers and employers .
" so unions did n't have to a hard life , " schneider said .
" they could concentrate on wage negotiations , but did n't have to talk about special programs for older workers or lay off protection .
but that has changed now . " short-term victories schneider reckons there are tough times ahead for germany 's unions .
he thinks he knows exactly where the present labor action in the public sector is likely to go .
first , the german people will be angry about civil servants going on strike , schneider believes , in part because of their perceived safe and cushy jobs .
but once garbage begins to pile up , or snow remains on the streets , " it 's only a matter of days before the people turn their anger from those who are striking to those who are preventing the strike from coming to an end , " schneider said .
government employers " will be forced to make some offers to the unions . " but unions should not expect that any success in coming days will lay meaningful groundwork for future victories , schneider warned .
he added that germany 's younger generations have already gotten the message regarding a completely different labor environment than the type enjoyed by their parents and grandparents . kyle mckinnon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?
after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .
but some say there could be negative side effects .

but neuschwanstein and king ludwig ii 's other castles are more than an obligatory kitsch stop on a whirlwind tour . the fairy tale castle of neuschwanstein remains the focal point for most tourists traveling to germany to take in impressive scenery and architecture .
however , for those who want to experience more of the madness of king ludwig ii , there are several other of the monarch 's outlandish abodes and places of interest in the valley between ammergau and the allgäuer alps . but the king 's final home is really the big draw .
a walk of just 30 minutes takes the inquisitive traveler from schwangau to the world-famous castle .
if you can fight your way through the coach loads of tourists who always include the disney-inspiring royal domicile on their tours of central europe , you will see what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a castle built for privacy now gets over a million visitors a year every year 1.3 million people visit " the castle of the fairy-tale king " .
in the summer around 6,000 visitors a day stream through rooms that were intended for a single person . while visiting the castle as part of a tour of southern germany is as obligatory as getting sloshed at oktoberfest or the hofbräuhaus in munich , visiting rothenburg or heidelberg , there is a reason why it is an essential part of the agenda . after gaping at the dream-like beauty of the castle itself , the other-worldly nature of the interiors really start to capture the imagination .
more than any other of his homes , neuschwanstein really shows what ludwig ii was trying to achieve when he had the castle built as his retreat from public life .
ludwig escaped into a dream world in the castle - the poetic world of the middle ages – which can be seen in vivid colors throughout the extravagantly decorated rooms . wagner-inspired rooms provided an escape into a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swan from a legend that inspired wagner decorates ludwig 's private quarters the rooms are filled by picture cycles inspired by the operas of richard wagner , to whom the king dedicated the castle .
these decorations , while not directly modeled on wagner 's works , take in the medieval legends that the composer was inspired by and provided ludwig was an alternate reality in which to live out his final days in blissful insanity . " i want to remain an eternal mystery to myself and others , " ludwig once told his governess , and it is this mysterious element that adds to the buildings grandeur .
people flock to see where the shy king retreated to but also to imagine what it was like to lose one 's self in such surroundings , ludwig 's final refuge from reality . a life in castles his unconventional approach to his rule led him to build a number of outrageously intricate castles of various styles and sizes between ammergau and the allgäuer alps , each one telling a different chapter in the story of his weird and wonderful life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig was also drawn to the mysterious chiemsee lake in his father 's neo-gothic castle at hohenschwangau , for example , ludwig ii spent his formative years while the herrenchiemsee palace – a copy of the palace at versailles built on lake chiem – was created during a period when ludwig himself mirrored louis xiv 's dream of becoming not merely a king but a god .
linderhof palace with its venus grotto , moorish kiosk and moroccan house meanwhile , was the monarch 's play castle - a bit like michael jackson 's neverland ranch . but it is neuschwanstein that sums up ludwig 's tenuous grip on real life and the magical madness that led to the creation of one of europe 's most iconic castles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de palatial digs in bavaria up for grabs if you 've ever imagined living in a converted castle , now 's your chance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.02.2006 germany 's labor unions inflate their worth , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers believe they still have strong public support , but analysts are n't so sure confident public service workers are on strike and heavy industry workers want big pay increases .
but do unions have the clout to make significant demands of employers ? garbage collectors , hospital staffers and child care workers in one of germany 's 16 states went out on strike this week as union bosses warned that civil service workers across the country may join the work stoppage next week .
it 's the first big public sector walkout in 14 years .
the dispute centers on the push by governments to increase the average employee work week from 38.5 to 40 hours without a corresponding increase in pay .
" without compensation for the extra hours , we 're not going to do it , " said one worker preparing to picket outside of a stuttgart government building . the public service workers believe they have the public on their side , even if much of the private sector in germany has already moved to 40 hours of work per week . wro n g issue at the wro n g time ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german unions see increasing profits in the private sector as cause to make significant new demands hilmar schneider , director of labor policy at bonn 's institute for the study of labor in bonn , believes the union representing the workers , ver.di , has gone too far . " the issue is 18 minutes per day working without being compensated , " schneider said . " is it really worth going on strike for the first time in 14 years ? " however , ursula engelen-kefer , deputy director of the federation of german trade unions , asked whether it is really worth it for state and local governments " to provoke such a big conflict over 18 minutes ? " engelen-kefer is tracking the public sector labor conflict , noting similarities with moves by private companies in search of profits which are trying to gain more concessions from unions .
some analysts have given credit to german workers for responding to globalization pressures by accepting lower wage increases and longer working hours than other european countries .
german jobs have been saved as a result , they say .
but a number of german companies have posted record profits recently .
those profits have led some unions to include significant wage increases in their strategic plans for upcoming negotiations . " it 's a clear cut division in society between those who have the benefits , who are very small in numbers and are very exclusive , while more and more parts of the population have to bear all of the sarcrifices , " engelen-kefer said . decli n i n g u n io n stre n gth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers have made major concessions to employers in recent years to ensure their jobs stay put .
labor union membership numbers have fallen dramatically in the last decade , however , and the general strength of germany 's unions has been in decline . labor market watcher schneider wonders if there is too much nostalgia for the days of the four and a half day work week and the guaranteed 30 days of vacation .
previously common worker benefits were mandated by the government , not by negotiations between workers and employers .
" so unions did n't have to a hard life , " schneider said .
" they could concentrate on wage negotiations , but did n't have to talk about special programs for older workers or lay off protection .
but that has changed now . " short-term victories schneider reckons there are tough times ahead for germany 's unions .
he thinks he knows exactly where the present labor action in the public sector is likely to go .
first , the german people will be angry about civil servants going on strike , schneider believes , in part because of their perceived safe and cushy jobs .
but once garbage begins to pile up , or snow remains on the streets , " it 's only a matter of days before the people turn their anger from those who are striking to those who are preventing the strike from coming to an end , " schneider said .
government employers " will be forced to make some offers to the unions . " but unions should not expect that any success in coming days will lay meaningful groundwork for future victories , schneider warned .
he added that germany 's younger generations have already gotten the message regarding a completely different labor environment than the type enjoyed by their parents and grandparents . kyle mckinnon send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working to live or living to work ?
after decades of reducing the work week , the trend seems to be reversing as employers demand more of workers to compete globally .

but neuschwanstein and king ludwig ii 's other castles are more than an obligatory kitsch stop on a whirlwind tour . the fairy tale castle of neuschwanstein remains the focal point for most tourists traveling to germany to take in impressive scenery and architecture .
however , for those who want to experience more of the madness of king ludwig ii , there are several other of the monarch 's outlandish abodes and places of interest in the valley between ammergau and the allgäuer alps . but the king 's final home is really the big draw .
a walk of just 30 minutes takes the inquisitive traveler from schwangau to the world-famous castle .
if you can fight your way through the coach loads of tourists who always include the disney-inspiring royal domicile on their tours of central europe , you will see what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a castle built for privacy now gets over a million visitors a year every year 1.3 million people visit " the castle of the fairy-tale king " .
in the summer around 6,000 visitors a day stream through rooms that were intended for a single person . while visiting the castle as part of a tour of southern germany is as obligatory as getting sloshed at oktoberfest or the hofbräuhaus in munich , visiting rothenburg or heidelberg , there is a reason why it is an essential part of the agenda . after gaping at the dream-like beauty of the castle itself , the other-worldly nature of the interiors really start to capture the imagination .
more than any other of his homes , neuschwanstein really shows what ludwig ii was trying to achieve when he had the castle built as his retreat from public life .
ludwig escaped into a dream world in the castle - the poetic world of the middle ages – which can be seen in vivid colors throughout the extravagantly decorated rooms . wagner-inspired rooms provided an escape into a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swan from a legend that inspired wagner decorates ludwig 's private quarters the rooms are filled by picture cycles inspired by the operas of richard wagner , to whom the king dedicated the castle .
these decorations , while not directly modeled on wagner 's works , take in the medieval legends that the composer was inspired by and provided ludwig was an alternate reality in which to live out his final days in blissful insanity . " i want to remain an eternal mystery to myself and others , " ludwig once told his governess , and it is this mysterious element that adds to the buildings grandeur .
people flock to see where the shy king retreated to but also to imagine what it was like to lose one 's self in such surroundings , ludwig 's final refuge from reality . a life in castles his unconventional approach to his rule led him to build a number of outrageously intricate castles of various styles and sizes between ammergau and the allgäuer alps , each one telling a different chapter in the story of his weird and wonderful life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig was also drawn to the mysterious chiemsee lake in his father 's neo-gothic castle at hohenschwangau , for example , ludwig ii spent his formative years while the herrenchiemsee palace – a copy of the palace at versailles built on lake chiem – was created during a period when ludwig himself mirrored louis xiv 's dream of becoming not merely a king but a god .
linderhof palace with its venus grotto , moorish kiosk and moroccan house meanwhile , was the monarch 's play castle - a bit like michael jackson 's neverland ranch . but it is neuschwanstein that sums up ludwig 's tenuous grip on real life and the magical madness that led to the creation of one of europe 's most iconic castles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de palatial digs in bavaria up for grabs if you 've ever imagined living in a converted castle , now 's your chance .

it 's the first time the deadly virus has been detected in the eu . the h5n1 strain of bird flu which is potentially deadly for humans has reached the european union , having been detected in members greece and italy as well as in bulgaria , officials said saturday . italian health minister francesco storace said the highly pathogenic strain , responsible for the deaths of some 90 people , mainly in asia , had been found in two dead swans on the island of sicily and was suspected in at least half-a-dozen birds elsewhere in the south of the country . the eu commission in brussels for its part said that italian authorities " confirmed outbreaks of h5n1 on the eastern coast of sicily , in taranto -lrb- puglia -rrb- and in calabria . " storace said a total of 17 swans had been found dead in sicily as well as the calabria and puglia regions , of which at least half were carrying a flu virus . no human infection from wild birds , assures minister storace tried to calm fears by saying that so far no one had caught the virus directly from wild birds .
all the human cases so far have been contracted from domestic poultry infected by wild birds . " we are relatively unworried as regards human health but there are reasons for concern for animal health , " he said . storace was to sign an order banning for 20 days all transport of living domestic animals that may be infected by the virus in the three affected regions . the measures being applied by italy are the establishment of a high-risk area -lrb- three-kilometer protection zone -rrb- around each of the outbreaks and a surrounding surveillance zone of 10 kilometers -lrb- 6.2 miles -rrb- , the european commission said . in the protection zone , poultry must be kept indoors , movement of poultry is banned except directly to the slaughterhouse and the dispatch of meat outside the zone is forbidden except where products have undergone the controls provided for in eu food controls legislation . in both the protection zone and the surveillance zone , on-farm biosecurity measures must be strengthened , hunting of wild birds is banned and disease awareness of poultry owners and their families must be carried out , the commission said . greece 's swan deaths link to h5n1 confirmed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fears of infection in greece , first aroused in october , have now been realized the measures have already been agreed by greece following the discovery of dead swans in the northern salonika region , which were confirmed saturday to have been carrying h5n1 . a goose infected with the h5 bird flu virus was also found on the aegean island of skyros but it was not yet known if it was the h5n1 strain . " in all regions where the h5 or h5n1 virus is detected planned preventative steps are enforced by official health authorities ; therefore there is no reason to take new measures , " the greek agriculture ministry said , warning against panicking as no poultry farms had been affected . fresh outbreaks in bulgaria , romania in brussels the european commission said the h5n1 strain had also been found in wild swans in the bulgarian wetland region of vidin , close to the romanian border , last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are investigating the return of the h5n1 virus to the danube delta in romania , health officials on saturday ordered tests after a possible new case of bird flu of the h5 strain was detected at a farm in the danube delta , the agriculture ministry said .
culling of poultry in sarina suf began saturday morning . the avian influenza situation in italy and other affected countries will be reviewed by the eu 's standing committee on the food and chain and animal health which meets thursday and friday . meanwhile in moscow , group of eight industrial powers warned saturday of the risk of a bird flu pandemic . detection of the virus within the european union appeared to show an alarmingly rapid spread of the disease , which was also confirmed in the past week to have crossed into africa for the first time . fears of rapid , unrestrained spread across africa " we call on the donor community to provide financial support to poor countries fighting the epidemic , " said a g8 statement issued after finance ministers wrapped up talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " highly pathogenic " strain of the h5n1 virus has been found in poultry stocks in nigeria nigeria announced wednesday africa 's first infections with the h5n1 strain . the spread of the disease to africa has led to fears it may run wild , infecting more people and providing more opportunities for the virus to mutate into a form able to jump from human to human . the h5n1 strain of bird flu found in nigerian poultry is the same virus previously detected in turkey , europe and china , which suggests it was brought to west africa by migrant birds , an expert with the world organization for animal health said friday . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion an international bird flu conference was hailed a huge success after it wrapped up wednesday with donor countries and organizations pledging $ 1.9 billion -lrb- 1.6 billion euros -rrb- to fight the killer virus .

" i 've said clearly that we will act along the lines of our constitution , " he said . jung 's comments came a day after a newspaper article quoted an official defense ministry report as saying that at least 2,000 german soldiers including specialist biological warfare units would be mobilized for the world cup finals the süddeutsche zeitung claimed that the soldiers , who are trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical attacks , would be stationed in each of the 12 cities where the matches will take place while two transport helicopters used to carry injured or wounded people will be based in laupheim in southern germany and in bückeburg in the northwest . it also stated that the army would erect an emergency surgical hospital in the western city of kaiserslautern and build a control tower for special flights at stuttgart airport in the south . the measures would cost around five million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- , of which 1.4 million euros would be covered by the german government and the federal states .
several opposition politicians and member of the social democrats have suggested that fifa , world soccer 's governing body , should foot the bill . domestic defense deployment unconstitutional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany army has served on home soil but not in a security role in theory , the measures would not constitute a domestic deployment of the german army which is banned by the country 's constitution , drawn up in 1945 after the fall of the third reich . hitler 's use of the wehrmacht before and during world war ii effectively turned nazi germany into a police state .
to use the army in a domestic defense capability would need a change to the constitution , something most german politicians are very wary of considering the lessons of the mid-20th century . supporters of the plan to deploy the modern day bundeswehr as security at the world cup say that this is all ancient history and that what applied to germany 60 years ago is irrelevant as the country , as host of the world 's largest single sports event , faces other challenges , including terrorism and hooligans . despite jung 's assertion that the bundeswehr will not be used , campaigners for the use of the german army at the world cup showed they had not been defeated in a parliamentary session on friday . schäuble 's plan takes a different tack to avoid all-out rejection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has another trick up his sleeve conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble 's proposal to change the constitution to allow the bundeswehr to be deployed on home soil was once again given an airing in the bundestag and was once again , for the time being at least , suspended . a constitutional change would require a two-thirds majority vote in favor ; a decision which at the present time seems unlikely .
but schäuble 's spokesperson stefan kaller told parliament that german soldiers could be used in a domestic security capacity if individual soldiers were deputized as police officers , allowing them to be used in the protection of buildings and other sensitive sites . the christian democratic union 's wolfgang bosbach announced shortly after that the application for the use of the deployment of the bundeswehr would be debated and decided upon " quickly " given the new alternatives to a constitutional change . opinions divided on bundeswehr world cup mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some oppose the deployment , others believe it would help the overstretched police force the ideas of deploying and / or deputizing soldiers were again met with opposition .
social democrat dieter wiefelspütz from the interior ministry told the bundestag that the constitution would not be changed while schleswig-holstein 's minister of the interior ralf stegner warned about the " militarization of internal security . " the debate continues to rage as germany 's policing capacities bend under the strain of dealing with multiple threats and challenges even before the tournament begins . for months , the organizers of the world cup have been working on comprehensive security plans to protect spectators , players and vips from around the world . under these plans , germany 's police force will be stretched very thin , a situation which has added extra weight to the argument for a domestic deployment of the army . public opinion in germany is pretty much evenly divided over the issue with some arguing that the army could easily be used to guard key buildings and would not have to be deployed in high profile areas , like stadiums or entertainment districts . others point out that the army is not trained for public security operations and lacks the necessary sensitivity in dealing with such encounters .
both may be right , but as günther beckstein , bavaria 's interior minister , argued , using the armed forces would take some of the pressure off the police .

" i 've said clearly that we will act along the lines of our constitution , " he said . jung 's comments came a day after a newspaper article quoted an official defense ministry report as saying that at least 2,000 german soldiers including specialist biological warfare units would be mobilized for the world cup finals the süddeutsche zeitung claimed that the soldiers , who are trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical attacks , would be stationed in each of the 12 cities where the matches will take place while two transport helicopters used to carry injured or wounded people will be based in laupheim in southern germany and in bückeburg in the northwest . it also stated that the army would erect an emergency surgical hospital in the western city of kaiserslautern and build a control tower for special flights at stuttgart airport in the south . the measures would cost around five million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- , of which 1.4 million euros would be covered by the german government and the federal states .
several opposition politicians and member of the social democrats have suggested that fifa , world soccer 's governing body , should foot the bill . domestic defense deployment unconstitutional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany army has served on home soil but not in a security role in theory , the measures would not constitute a domestic deployment of the german army which is banned by the country 's constitution , drawn up in 1945 after the fall of the third reich . hitler 's use of the wehrmacht before and during world war ii effectively turned nazi germany into a police state .
to use the army in a domestic defense capability would need a change to the constitution , something most german politicians are very wary of considering the lessons of the mid-20th century . supporters of the plan to deploy the modern day bundeswehr as security at the world cup say that this is all ancient history and that what applied to germany 60 years ago is irrelevant as the country , as host of the world 's largest single sports event , faces other challenges , including terrorism and hooligans . despite jung 's assertion that the bundeswehr will not be used , campaigners for the use of the german army at the world cup showed they had not been defeated in a parliamentary session on friday . schäuble 's plan takes a different tack to avoid all-out rejection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has another trick up his sleeve conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble 's proposal to change the constitution to allow the bundeswehr to be deployed on home soil was once again given an airing in the bundestag and was once again , for the time being at least , suspended . a constitutional change would require a two-thirds majority vote in favor ; a decision which at the present time seems unlikely .
but schäuble 's spokesperson stefan kaller told parliament that german soldiers could be used in a domestic security capacity if individual soldiers were deputized as police officers , allowing them to be used in the protection of buildings and other sensitive sites . the christian democratic union 's wolfgang bosbach announced shortly after that the application for the use of the deployment of the bundeswehr would be debated and decided upon " quickly " given the new alternatives to a constitutional change . opinions divided on bundeswehr world cup mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some oppose the deployment , others believe it would help the overstretched police force the ideas of deploying and / or deputizing soldiers were again met with opposition .
social democrat dieter wiefelspütz from the interior ministry told the bundestag that the constitution would not be changed while schleswig-holstein 's minister of the interior ralf stegner warned about the " militarization of internal security . " the debate continues to rage as germany 's policing capacities bend under the strain of dealing with multiple threats and challenges even before the tournament begins . for months , the organizers of the world cup have been working on comprehensive security plans to protect spectators , players and vips from around the world . under these plans , germany 's police force will be stretched very thin , a situation which has added extra weight to the argument for a domestic deployment of the army . public opinion in germany is pretty much evenly divided over the issue with some arguing that the army could easily be used to guard key buildings and would not have to be deployed in high profile areas , like stadiums or entertainment districts . others point out that the army is not trained for public security operations and lacks the necessary sensitivity in dealing with such encounters .
both may be right , but as günther beckstein , bavaria 's interior minister , argued , using the armed forces would take some of the pressure off the police . " all measures by the army to assume duties , like the protection of property , would free up hundreds of police for actual police work , " the christian social union politician said . nato ready to help , germany unwilling to pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : awacs planes will be available to germany , and fifa will be expected to pay armed forces , not specifically the german army , have already been penciled in for security duties at the world cup with nato officials declaring recently that the alliance fully expects to be called upon by the german government to provide awacs surveillance planes at the world cup , a request that nato would oblige . this in turn has created further friction as the german government has made it clear that it would not expect to pay for the added security at the world cup and that it would pass the bill to fifa .

but neuschwanstein and king ludwig ii 's other castles are more than an obligatory kitsch stop on a whirlwind tour . the fairy tale castle of neuschwanstein remains the focal point for most tourists traveling to germany to take in impressive scenery and architecture .
however , for those who want to experience more of the madness of king ludwig ii , there are several other of the monarch 's outlandish abodes and places of interest in the valley between ammergau and the allgäuer alps . but the king 's final home is really the big draw .
a walk of just 30 minutes takes the inquisitive traveler from schwangau to the world-famous castle .
if you can fight your way through the coach loads of tourists who always include the disney-inspiring royal domicile on their tours of central europe , you will see what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a castle built for privacy now gets over a million visitors a year every year 1.3 million people visit " the castle of the fairy-tale king " .
in the summer around 6,000 visitors a day stream through rooms that were intended for a single person . while visiting the castle as part of a tour of southern germany is as obligatory as getting sloshed at oktoberfest or the hofbräuhaus in munich , visiting rothenburg or heidelberg , there is a reason why it is an essential part of the agenda . after gaping at the dream-like beauty of the castle itself , the other-worldly nature of the interiors really start to capture the imagination .
more than any other of his homes , neuschwanstein really shows what ludwig ii was trying to achieve when he had the castle built as his retreat from public life .
ludwig escaped into a dream world in the castle - the poetic world of the middle ages – which can be seen in vivid colors throughout the extravagantly decorated rooms . wagner-inspired rooms provided an escape into a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swan from a legend that inspired wagner decorates ludwig 's private quarters the rooms are filled by picture cycles inspired by the operas of richard wagner , to whom the king dedicated the castle .
these decorations , while not directly modeled on wagner 's works , take in the medieval legends that the composer was inspired by and provided ludwig was an alternate reality in which to live out his final days in blissful insanity . " i want to remain an eternal mystery to myself and others , " ludwig once told his governess , and it is this mysterious element that adds to the buildings grandeur .
people flock to see where the shy king retreated to but also to imagine what it was like to lose one 's self in such surroundings , ludwig 's final refuge from reality . a life in castles his unconventional approach to his rule led him to build a number of outrageously intricate castles of various styles and sizes between ammergau and the allgäuer alps , each one telling a different chapter in the story of his weird and wonderful life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig was also drawn to the mysterious chiemsee lake in his father 's neo-gothic castle at hohenschwangau , for example , ludwig ii spent his formative years while the herrenchiemsee palace – a copy of the palace at versailles built on lake chiem – was created during a period when ludwig himself mirrored louis xiv 's dream of becoming not merely a king but a god .
linderhof palace with its venus grotto , moorish kiosk and moroccan house meanwhile , was the monarch 's play castle - a bit like michael jackson 's neverland ranch . but it is neuschwanstein that sums up ludwig 's tenuous grip on real life and the magical madness that led to the creation of one of europe 's most iconic castles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de palatial digs in bavaria up for grabs if you 've ever imagined living in a converted castle , now 's your chance .

here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .

here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .
the mutation could occur if h5n1 co-infects a human who already has ordinary flu or the agent is picked up from poultry by an animal such as a pig that can carry both bird and regular flu strains . past pandemics : the 20th century saw three flu pandemics , in 1918-19 , 1957-58 and 1968-69 .

here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .
the mutation could occur if h5n1 co-infects a human who already has ordinary flu or the agent is picked up from poultry by an animal such as a pig that can carry both bird and regular flu strains . past pandemics : the 20th century saw three flu pandemics , in 1918-19 , 1957-58 and 1968-69 .
the 1918-19 pandemic killed as many as 50 million people - larger than the death toll from aids in more than two decades .
jet travel , the world 's huge population today and the larger number of people with compromised immune systems -lrb- from hiv and cancer , for instance -rrb- compared with 1918 could contribute to a far heavier toll . economic cost : a global pandemic of any scale would cost hundreds of billions of dollars because of the disruption to economic life .
the world bank estimates a bill of $ 550 billion -lrb- 465 billion euros -rrb- for rich countries alone .
the asian development bank -lrb- adb -rrb- estimates costs for asia ranging from $ 99 billion to $ 283 billion .
as a comparison , severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which killed fewer than 800 people in its 2003 outbreak , cost more than $ 30 billion . veterinary controls : these are the time-honored first line of defense in any outbreak of animal disease .
the task is to identify farms where there is an outbreak of h5n1 , quarantine the area , kill all fowl suspected to be in contact with it , disinfect machinery , vehicles and clothing , and bar sales of poultry products from the affected region .
but these controls are only really dependable if a country has a good surveillance network and responds quickly and effectively to an outbreak .
adequate compensation , too , is essential for encouraging honest reporting by farmers . counter-measures : an international conference in beijing drew more than $ 1.9 billion dollars in pledges to help fight bird flu , after experts estimated that around that amount would be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defenses .
an action plan drawn up in november stresses greater veterinary surveillance to detect outbreaks , preventative vaccination of poultry , culling of infected flocks and compensation for farmers .
its other focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . vaccine : no definitive vaccine against the viral threat is available as no one knows the precise shape the virus would take after mutating .
several prototypes are being explored .
but the risk is that they could be only partially effective or even useless because the genetic shape of the virus will have changed and thus will not be recognized by antibodies .
if a pandemic does occur , the big concern is about the delay .
it could take up to six months to formulate and test the right vaccine , which will only be available in limited quantities immediately thereafter .
traditionally , flu vaccines take up to nine months to manufacture , using egg-based technology , although ways of speeding this up using genetic " reverse engineering " are being intensively explored . drug arsenal : the range of antiviral drugs is small , but especially so when it comes to bird flu .
only two are considered effective against h5n1 : zanamivir -lrb- commercialized as relenza -rrb- and oseltamivir -lrb- tamiflu -rrb- .
these medications are called neuraminidase inhibitors , which block the virus from replicating .
if taken within a couple of days of the onset of illness , they can ease the severity of some symptoms and reduce the duration of sickness .
the who recommends that countries stockpile antivirals , but does not give a figure as to how big that stockpile should be .

but neuschwanstein and king ludwig ii 's other castles are more than an obligatory kitsch stop on a whirlwind tour . the fairy tale castle of neuschwanstein remains the focal point for most tourists traveling to germany to take in impressive scenery and architecture .
however , for those who want to experience more of the madness of king ludwig ii , there are several other of the monarch 's outlandish abodes and places of interest in the valley between ammergau and the allgäuer alps . but the king 's final home is really the big draw .
a walk of just 30 minutes takes the inquisitive traveler from schwangau to the world-famous castle .
if you can fight your way through the coach loads of tourists who always include the disney-inspiring royal domicile on their tours of central europe , you will see what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a castle built for privacy now gets over a million visitors a year every year 1.3 million people visit " the castle of the fairy-tale king " .
in the summer around 6,000 visitors a day stream through rooms that were intended for a single person . while visiting the castle as part of a tour of southern germany is as obligatory as getting sloshed at oktoberfest or the hofbräuhaus in munich , visiting rothenburg or heidelberg , there is a reason why it is an essential part of the agenda . after gaping at the dream-like beauty of the castle itself , the other-worldly nature of the interiors really start to capture the imagination .
more than any other of his homes , neuschwanstein really shows what ludwig ii was trying to achieve when he had the castle built as his retreat from public life .
ludwig escaped into a dream world in the castle - the poetic world of the middle ages – which can be seen in vivid colors throughout the extravagantly decorated rooms . wagner-inspired rooms provided an escape into a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swan from a legend that inspired wagner decorates ludwig 's private quarters the rooms are filled by picture cycles inspired by the operas of richard wagner , to whom the king dedicated the castle .
these decorations , while not directly modeled on wagner 's works , take in the medieval legends that the composer was inspired by and provided ludwig was an alternate reality in which to live out his final days in blissful insanity . " i want to remain an eternal mystery to myself and others , " ludwig once told his governess , and it is this mysterious element that adds to the buildings grandeur .
people flock to see where the shy king retreated to but also to imagine what it was like to lose one 's self in such surroundings , ludwig 's final refuge from reality . a life in castles his unconventional approach to his rule led him to build a number of outrageously intricate castles of various styles and sizes between ammergau and the allgäuer alps , each one telling a different chapter in the story of his weird and wonderful life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig was also drawn to the mysterious chiemsee lake in his father 's neo-gothic castle at hohenschwangau , for example , ludwig ii spent his formative years while the herrenchiemsee palace – a copy of the palace at versailles built on lake chiem – was created during a period when ludwig himself mirrored louis xiv 's dream of becoming not merely a king but a god .
linderhof palace with its venus grotto , moorish kiosk and moroccan house meanwhile , was the monarch 's play castle - a bit like michael jackson 's neverland ranch . but it is neuschwanstein that sums up ludwig 's tenuous grip on real life and the magical madness that led to the creation of one of europe 's most iconic castles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de palatial digs in bavaria up for grabs if you 've ever imagined living in a converted castle , now 's your chance .

linderhof palace with its venus grotto , moorish kiosk and moroccan house meanwhile , was the monarch 's play castle - a bit like michael jackson 's neverland ranch . but it is neuschwanstein that sums up ludwig 's tenuous grip on real life and the magical madness that led to the creation of one of europe 's most iconic castles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de palatial digs in bavaria up for grabs if you 've ever imagined living in a converted castle , now 's your chance .

but neuschwanstein and king ludwig ii 's other castles are more than an obligatory kitsch stop on a whirlwind tour . the fairy tale castle of neuschwanstein remains the focal point for most tourists traveling to germany to take in impressive scenery and architecture .
however , for those who want to experience more of the madness of king ludwig ii , there are several other of the monarch 's outlandish abodes and places of interest in the valley between ammergau and the allgäuer alps . but the king 's final home is really the big draw .
a walk of just 30 minutes takes the inquisitive traveler from schwangau to the world-famous castle .
if you can fight your way through the coach loads of tourists who always include the disney-inspiring royal domicile on their tours of central europe , you will see what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a castle built for privacy now gets over a million visitors a year every year 1.3 million people visit " the castle of the fairy-tale king " .
in the summer around 6,000 visitors a day stream through rooms that were intended for a single person . while visiting the castle as part of a tour of southern germany is as obligatory as getting sloshed at oktoberfest or the hofbräuhaus in munich , visiting rothenburg or heidelberg , there is a reason why it is an essential part of the agenda . after gaping at the dream-like beauty of the castle itself , the other-worldly nature of the interiors really start to capture the imagination .
more than any other of his homes , neuschwanstein really shows what ludwig ii was trying to achieve when he had the castle built as his retreat from public life .
ludwig escaped into a dream world in the castle - the poetic world of the middle ages – which can be seen in vivid colors throughout the extravagantly decorated rooms . wagner-inspired rooms provided an escape into a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swan from a legend that inspired wagner decorates ludwig 's private quarters the rooms are filled by picture cycles inspired by the operas of richard wagner , to whom the king dedicated the castle .
these decorations , while not directly modeled on wagner 's works , take in the medieval legends that the composer was inspired by and provided ludwig was an alternate reality in which to live out his final days in blissful insanity . " i want to remain an eternal mystery to myself and others , " ludwig once told his governess , and it is this mysterious element that adds to the buildings grandeur .
people flock to see where the shy king retreated to but also to imagine what it was like to lose one 's self in such surroundings , ludwig 's final refuge from reality . a life in castles his unconventional approach to his rule led him to build a number of outrageously intricate castles of various styles and sizes between ammergau and the allgäuer alps , each one telling a different chapter in the story of his weird and wonderful life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig was also drawn to the mysterious chiemsee lake in his father 's neo-gothic castle at hohenschwangau , for example , ludwig ii spent his formative years while the herrenchiemsee palace – a copy of the palace at versailles built on lake chiem – was created during a period when ludwig himself mirrored louis xiv 's dream of becoming not merely a king but a god .
linderhof palace with its venus grotto , moorish kiosk and moroccan house meanwhile , was the monarch 's play castle - a bit like michael jackson 's neverland ranch . but it is neuschwanstein that sums up ludwig 's tenuous grip on real life and the magical madness that led to the creation of one of europe 's most iconic castles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de palatial digs in bavaria up for grabs if you 've ever imagined living in a converted castle , now 's your chance .

" i 've said clearly that we will act along the lines of our constitution , " he said . jung 's comments came a day after a newspaper article quoted an official defense ministry report as saying that at least 2,000 german soldiers including specialist biological warfare units would be mobilized for the world cup finals the süddeutsche zeitung claimed that the soldiers , who are trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical attacks , would be stationed in each of the 12 cities where the matches will take place while two transport helicopters used to carry injured or wounded people will be based in laupheim in southern germany and in bückeburg in the northwest . it also stated that the army would erect an emergency surgical hospital in the western city of kaiserslautern and build a control tower for special flights at stuttgart airport in the south . the measures would cost around five million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- , of which 1.4 million euros would be covered by the german government and the federal states .

here dw-world presents an updated file on the facts of the disease . what is bird flu ?
bird flu is also called avian influenza .
there are 15 strains of flu that affect birds , but the one behind the global health scare is the sub-type known as h5n1 .
the first known cases of bird flu were detected in hong kong in 1997 and also involved h5n1 . how it spreads to humans : almost all the human cases of bird flu have been people who were directly exposed to infected fowl .
they made contact with the virus through the birds ' saliva , nasal secretions and feces , which become dry , pulverized and are then inhaled . the death toll : as of feb .
9 , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- had confirmed 88 deaths from h5n1 out of 165 cases of human infection .
vietnam has the most fatalities , with 42 , followed by indonesia -lrb- 16 -rrb- , thailand -lrb- 14 -rrb- , china -lrb- seven -rrb- , cambodia -lrb- four -rrb- , turkey -lrb- four -rrb- and iraq -lrb- one -rrb- .
this list does not include an iraqi kurd whose death was reported by local authorities on monday , two indonesian women who died thursday and friday respectively and a woman 's death reported by china on friday . symptoms : bird flu in humans causes symptoms that are like human flu , such as fever , cough , sore throat and muscle aches , conjunctivitis , pneumonia and other severe respiratory diseases . is chicken safe ? avian flu is not a food-borne virus , so the risk from eating properly cooked poultry is considered negligible . the risk : at present , h5n1 is not easily transmitted from bird to human .
in other words , a person would have to pick up a lot of virus in order to be infected .
nor is it easily passed from human to human : there have been only three suspected cases in which this is believed to have happened .
the big worry is that h5n1 could pick up genes from conventional human flu viruses , mutating into a form both highly lethal and highly infectious .
as it would be a radically new pathogen , no one would have any immunity to it .
the mutation could occur if h5n1 co-infects a human who already has ordinary flu or the agent is picked up from poultry by an animal such as a pig that can carry both bird and regular flu strains . past pandemics : the 20th century saw three flu pandemics , in 1918-19 , 1957-58 and 1968-69 .
the 1918-19 pandemic killed as many as 50 million people - larger than the death toll from aids in more than two decades .
jet travel , the world 's huge population today and the larger number of people with compromised immune systems -lrb- from hiv and cancer , for instance -rrb- compared with 1918 could contribute to a far heavier toll . economic cost : a global pandemic of any scale would cost hundreds of billions of dollars because of the disruption to economic life .
the world bank estimates a bill of $ 550 billion -lrb- 465 billion euros -rrb- for rich countries alone .
the asian development bank -lrb- adb -rrb- estimates costs for asia ranging from $ 99 billion to $ 283 billion .
as a comparison , severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which killed fewer than 800 people in its 2003 outbreak , cost more than $ 30 billion . veterinary controls : these are the time-honored first line of defense in any outbreak of animal disease .
the task is to identify farms where there is an outbreak of h5n1 , quarantine the area , kill all fowl suspected to be in contact with it , disinfect machinery , vehicles and clothing , and bar sales of poultry products from the affected region .
but these controls are only really dependable if a country has a good surveillance network and responds quickly and effectively to an outbreak .
adequate compensation , too , is essential for encouraging honest reporting by farmers . counter-measures : an international conference in beijing drew more than $ 1.9 billion dollars in pledges to help fight bird flu , after experts estimated that around that amount would be needed over the next three years to help poor countries shore up their defenses .
an action plan drawn up in november stresses greater veterinary surveillance to detect outbreaks , preventative vaccination of poultry , culling of infected flocks and compensation for farmers .
its other focus is on strengthening health monitoring systems , stockpiling of antiviral drugs to dampen the spread of an outbreak and exercises to train medical personnel and the public . vaccine : no definitive vaccine against the viral threat is available as no one knows the precise shape the virus would take after mutating .
several prototypes are being explored .
but the risk is that they could be only partially effective or even useless because the genetic shape of the virus will have changed and thus will not be recognized by antibodies .
if a pandemic does occur , the big concern is about the delay .
it could take up to six months to formulate and test the right vaccine , which will only be available in limited quantities immediately thereafter .
traditionally , flu vaccines take up to nine months to manufacture , using egg-based technology , although ways of speeding this up using genetic " reverse engineering " are being intensively explored . drug arsenal : the range of antiviral drugs is small , but especially so when it comes to bird flu .
only two are considered effective against h5n1 : zanamivir -lrb- commercialized as relenza -rrb- and oseltamivir -lrb- tamiflu -rrb- .
these medications are called neuraminidase inhibitors , which block the virus from replicating .
if taken within a couple of days of the onset of illness , they can ease the severity of some symptoms and reduce the duration of sickness .
the who recommends that countries stockpile antivirals , but does not give a figure as to how big that stockpile should be .
it hopes to have its own stockpile , sufficient for three million people , by early 2006 .
a looming worry is whether the shifting virus might become resistant to tamiflu . sources : who , us centers for disease control and prevention -lrb- cdc -rrb- , us national institutes of health -lrb- nih -rrb- , world organization for animal health -lrb- oie -rrb- , nature , british medical journal -lrb- bmj -rrb- , the lancet , new england journal of medicine -lrb- nejm -rrb- , us department of health and human resources , news reports . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu : the continuing threat dw-world 's dossier of articles on the bird flu threat to europe .

" storace said a total of 17 swans had been found dead in sicily as well as the calabria and puglia regions , of which at least half were carrying a flu virus . no human infection from wild birds , assures minister storace tried to calm fears by saying that so far no one had caught the virus directly from wild birds .
all the human cases so far have been contracted from domestic poultry infected by wild birds .

" i 've said clearly that we will act along the lines of our constitution , " he said . jung 's comments came a day after a newspaper article quoted an official defense ministry report as saying that at least 2,000 german soldiers including specialist biological warfare units would be mobilized for the world cup finals the süddeutsche zeitung claimed that the soldiers , who are trained in dealing with nuclear , biological and chemical attacks , would be stationed in each of the 12 cities where the matches will take place while two transport helicopters used to carry injured or wounded people will be based in laupheim in southern germany and in bückeburg in the northwest . it also stated that the army would erect an emergency surgical hospital in the western city of kaiserslautern and build a control tower for special flights at stuttgart airport in the south . the measures would cost around five million euros -lrb- $ 6 million -rrb- , of which 1.4 million euros would be covered by the german government and the federal states .
several opposition politicians and member of the social democrats have suggested that fifa , world soccer 's governing body , should foot the bill . domestic defense deployment unconstitutional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the germany army has served on home soil but not in a security role in theory , the measures would not constitute a domestic deployment of the german army which is banned by the country 's constitution , drawn up in 1945 after the fall of the third reich . hitler 's use of the wehrmacht before and during world war ii effectively turned nazi germany into a police state .
to use the army in a domestic defense capability would need a change to the constitution , something most german politicians are very wary of considering the lessons of the mid-20th century . supporters of the plan to deploy the modern day bundeswehr as security at the world cup say that this is all ancient history and that what applied to germany 60 years ago is irrelevant as the country , as host of the world 's largest single sports event , faces other challenges , including terrorism and hooligans . despite jung 's assertion that the bundeswehr will not be used , campaigners for the use of the german army at the world cup showed they had not been defeated in a parliamentary session on friday . schäuble 's plan takes a different tack to avoid all-out rejection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister wolfgang schäuble has another trick up his sleeve conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble 's proposal to change the constitution to allow the bundeswehr to be deployed on home soil was once again given an airing in the bundestag and was once again , for the time being at least , suspended . a constitutional change would require a two-thirds majority vote in favor ; a decision which at the present time seems unlikely .
but schäuble 's spokesperson stefan kaller told parliament that german soldiers could be used in a domestic security capacity if individual soldiers were deputized as police officers , allowing them to be used in the protection of buildings and other sensitive sites . the christian democratic union 's wolfgang bosbach announced shortly after that the application for the use of the deployment of the bundeswehr would be debated and decided upon " quickly " given the new alternatives to a constitutional change . opinions divided on bundeswehr world cup mission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while some oppose the deployment , others believe it would help the overstretched police force the ideas of deploying and / or deputizing soldiers were again met with opposition .
social democrat dieter wiefelspütz from the interior ministry told the bundestag that the constitution would not be changed while schleswig-holstein 's minister of the interior ralf stegner warned about the " militarization of internal security . " the debate continues to rage as germany 's policing capacities bend under the strain of dealing with multiple threats and challenges even before the tournament begins . for months , the organizers of the world cup have been working on comprehensive security plans to protect spectators , players and vips from around the world . under these plans , germany 's police force will be stretched very thin , a situation which has added extra weight to the argument for a domestic deployment of the army . public opinion in germany is pretty much evenly divided over the issue with some arguing that the army could easily be used to guard key buildings and would not have to be deployed in high profile areas , like stadiums or entertainment districts . others point out that the army is not trained for public security operations and lacks the necessary sensitivity in dealing with such encounters .
both may be right , but as günther beckstein , bavaria 's interior minister , argued , using the armed forces would take some of the pressure off the police . " all measures by the army to assume duties , like the protection of property , would free up hundreds of police for actual police work , " the christian social union politician said . nato ready to help , germany unwilling to pay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : awacs planes will be available to germany , and fifa will be expected to pay armed forces , not specifically the german army , have already been penciled in for security duties at the world cup with nato officials declaring recently that the alliance fully expects to be called upon by the german government to provide awacs surveillance planes at the world cup , a request that nato would oblige . this in turn has created further friction as the german government has made it clear that it would not expect to pay for the added security at the world cup and that it would pass the bill to fifa .

but neuschwanstein and king ludwig ii 's other castles are more than an obligatory kitsch stop on a whirlwind tour . the fairy tale castle of neuschwanstein remains the focal point for most tourists traveling to germany to take in impressive scenery and architecture .
however , for those who want to experience more of the madness of king ludwig ii , there are several other of the monarch 's outlandish abodes and places of interest in the valley between ammergau and the allgäuer alps . but the king 's final home is really the big draw .
a walk of just 30 minutes takes the inquisitive traveler from schwangau to the world-famous castle .
if you can fight your way through the coach loads of tourists who always include the disney-inspiring royal domicile on their tours of central europe , you will see what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a castle built for privacy now gets over a million visitors a year every year 1.3 million people visit " the castle of the fairy-tale king " .
in the summer around 6,000 visitors a day stream through rooms that were intended for a single person . while visiting the castle as part of a tour of southern germany is as obligatory as getting sloshed at oktoberfest or the hofbräuhaus in munich , visiting rothenburg or heidelberg , there is a reason why it is an essential part of the agenda . after gaping at the dream-like beauty of the castle itself , the other-worldly nature of the interiors really start to capture the imagination .
more than any other of his homes , neuschwanstein really shows what ludwig ii was trying to achieve when he had the castle built as his retreat from public life .
ludwig escaped into a dream world in the castle - the poetic world of the middle ages – which can be seen in vivid colors throughout the extravagantly decorated rooms . wagner-inspired rooms provided an escape into a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swan from a legend that inspired wagner decorates ludwig 's private quarters the rooms are filled by picture cycles inspired by the operas of richard wagner , to whom the king dedicated the castle .
these decorations , while not directly modeled on wagner 's works , take in the medieval legends that the composer was inspired by and provided ludwig was an alternate reality in which to live out his final days in blissful insanity . " i want to remain an eternal mystery to myself and others , " ludwig once told his governess , and it is this mysterious element that adds to the buildings grandeur .
people flock to see where the shy king retreated to but also to imagine what it was like to lose one 's self in such surroundings , ludwig 's final refuge from reality . a life in castles his unconventional approach to his rule led him to build a number of outrageously intricate castles of various styles and sizes between ammergau and the allgäuer alps , each one telling a different chapter in the story of his weird and wonderful life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwig was also drawn to the mysterious chiemsee lake in his father 's neo-gothic castle at hohenschwangau , for example , ludwig ii spent his formative years while the herrenchiemsee palace – a copy of the palace at versailles built on lake chiem – was created during a period when ludwig himself mirrored louis xiv 's dream of becoming not merely a king but a god .
linderhof palace with its venus grotto , moorish kiosk and moroccan house meanwhile , was the monarch 's play castle - a bit like michael jackson 's neverland ranch . but it is neuschwanstein that sums up ludwig 's tenuous grip on real life and the magical madness that led to the creation of one of europe 's most iconic castles . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : palatial digs in bavaria up for grabs if you 've ever imagined living in a converted castle , now 's your chance .

they will show that the introduction of " top-up " fees is having an impact on the demand for university places in england .
however , soundings suggest they will be down by only a few percentage points which , after last 's year spike in demand , will not yet ring alarm bells or suggest school-leavers are abandoning the idea of going to university .
this will be a great relief to the government which , with its hands full on schools policy , would not welcome a re-run of concerns over the effects of higher university fees .
nevertheless these are anxious times for universities .
while student demand is healthy at present , there is a big demographic decline looming from 2010 when the number of 18-year-olds in the population goes into a long and steady decline .
at the same time , university leaders point out that the extra income from " top-up " fees will make only a marginal difference , as much of it will go on funding student bursaries .
despite predictions that " top-up " fees could rise to £ 5,000 , there is no chance of the £ 3,000 cap being raised before the promised review of student finance in 2009 .
that is why so many universities have been pinning their hopes on recruiting more international students who , providing they come from outside the eu , can be charged much higher fees .
so far this has proved to be a very lucrative business for british universities : international students are estimated to bring in about £ 4bn a year to british universities and some £ 10bn to the economy as a whole .
numbers have been steadily rising for some years and there are now around 300,000 overseas students in the uk .
recent predictions have suggested the global market for international students will grow fast .
a recent major study , called " vision 2020 " , suggested there could be a tripling of demand in the uk by that date .
too hopeful on this optimistic outlook , that would mean 850,000 overseas students in the uk by 2020 .
however , a conference organised by the universities and colleges admissions service -lrb- ucas -rrb- this week suggested that this optimistic prediction could be just that - too hopeful .
the message was that the uk has been complacent and the international student market for british universities could be about to collapse .
if it does - on top of a slowing of domestic demand because of " top up " fees and demographic change - then universities face a bleak future .
we might not quite be into the territory of ghost campuses with grass growing up through deserted accommodation blocks , but there might have to be painful contraction .
the reason for the concern lies in the fact that the uk is now losing market share in the global student market .
why ?
the answer is simple : competition is hotting up .
take china , for example .
last year , the number of uk student visa applications made in beijing fell by 38 % .
at the same time , according to dr tim westlake , director of international development at manchester university , china has doubled its own undergraduate provision in the past five years .
that sort of growth makes uk university expansion look miniscule and it suggests a new policy in china of educating students at home .
elite chinese universities , like tsinghua , are now - according to dr westlake - opening campuses in other parts of that huge country in order to compete with the best universities in the world .
meanwhile the uk 's biggest competitors in the overseas market - the usa and australia - are both investing heavily in building their market share .
australia 's overseas student enrolment has doubled since 2000 .
new competition is also emerging from the far east and the middle east .
at present , the international student market is dominated by english-speaking countries .
the global dominance of the english language has given the uk , the usa , and australia a real competitive edge .
that is now under threat as universities in continental europe have started to provide courses for overseas students that are taught in english .
for example , dr westlake cites malaysia , which is sending medical students to russia where they are being taught in english .
so , just as british universities have started to rely heavily on the overseas market to sustain their over-stretched budgets , it seems the bubble could be about to burst . "
overall , the number of overseas students rose by just 0.3 % " a survey for universities uk shows that four out of five universities saw enrolments of overseas students decline in 2005 .
this is affecting the top universities too : a survey of universities in the elite russell group showed 60 % experienced a decline in overseas students last year .
overall , despite many universities budgeting for a big increase in overseas student income last year , the number of overseas students rose by just 0.3 % .
the irony is that this decline in the uk share of the global student market has happened in the very years when the prime minister has backed an initiative aimed at boosting overseas recruitment .
risk some of the government 's actions have not helped .
last summer the price of student visas doubled .
this hardly sent a welcoming signal to foreign students .
the risk now is that universities that have had their fingers burnt in the overseas markets will either withdraw , reduce their marketing investment , or attempt to reduce the quality of courses through cost-cutting .
however , as dr westlake has put it , success will depend on the " brand " .
british universities can not promise the sunshine and beaches of australia or the low cost of living of the usa .
so the unique selling points will have to be the quality of our degrees and the quality of the student experience .
that does not mean opening up overseas franchises or trying to accommodate overseas students on the cheap .
providing british universities respond to the new competitive environment , overseas students will continue to be an important ingredient in british universities .
but they are not going to be the financial panacea that some had hoped .

last year , the number of uk student visa applications made in beijing fell by 38 % .
applications for this year are expected to be down at the same time , according to dr tim westlake , director of international development at manchester university , china has doubled its own undergraduate provision in the past five years .
that sort of growth makes uk university expansion look miniscule and it suggests a new policy in china of educating students at home .
elite chinese universities , like tsinghua , are now - according to dr westlake - opening campuses in other parts of that huge country in order to compete with the best universities in the world .
meanwhile the uk 's biggest competitors in the overseas market - the usa and australia - are both investing heavily in building their market share .
australia 's overseas student enrolment has doubled since 2000 .
new competition is also emerging from the far east and the middle east .
at present , the international student market is dominated by english-speaking countries .
the global dominance of the english language has given the uk , the usa , and australia a real competitive edge .
that is now under threat as universities in continental europe have started to provide courses for overseas students that are taught in english .
for example , dr westlake cites malaysia , which is sending medical students to russia where they are being taught in english .
so , just as british universities have started to rely heavily on the overseas market to sustain their over-stretched budgets , it seems the bubble could be about to burst .
overall , the number of overseas students rose by just 0.3 % a survey for universities uk shows that four out of five universities saw enrolments of overseas students decline in 2005 .
this is affecting the top universities too : a survey of universities in the elite russell group showed 60 % experienced a decline in overseas students last year .
overall , despite many universities budgeting for a big increase in overseas student income last year , the number of overseas students rose by just 0.3 % .
the irony is that this decline in the uk share of the global student market has happened in the very years when the prime minister has backed an initiative aimed at boosting overseas recruitment .
risk some of the government 's actions have not helped .
last summer the price of student visas doubled .
this hardly sent a welcoming signal to foreign students .
the risk now is that universities that have had their fingers burnt in the overseas markets will either withdraw , reduce their marketing investment , or attempt to reduce the quality of courses through cost-cutting .
however , as dr westlake has put it , success will depend on the " brand " .
british universities can not promise the sunshine and beaches of australia or the low cost of living of the usa .
so the unique selling points will have to be the quality of our degrees and the quality of the student experience .
that does not mean opening up overseas franchises or trying to accommodate overseas students on the cheap .
providing british universities respond to the new competitive environment , overseas students will continue to be an important ingredient in british universities .
but they are not going to be the financial panacea that some had hoped .

they will show that the introduction of " top-up " fees is having an impact on the demand for university places in england .
however , soundings suggest they will be down by only a few percentage points which , after last 's year spike in demand , will not yet ring alarm bells or suggest school-leavers are abandoning the idea of going to university .
this will be a great relief to the government which , with its hands full on schools policy , would not welcome a re-run of concerns over the effects of higher university fees .
nevertheless these are anxious times for universities .
while student demand is healthy at present , there is a big demographic decline looming from 2010 when the number of 18-year-olds in the population goes into a long and steady decline .
at the same time , university leaders point out that the extra income from " top-up " fees will make only a marginal difference , as much of it will go on funding student bursaries .
despite predictions that " top-up " fees could rise to £ 5,000 , there is no chance of the £ 3,000 cap being raised before the promised review of student finance in 2009 .
that is why so many universities have been pinning their hopes on recruiting more international students who , providing they come from outside the eu , can be charged much higher fees .
so far this has proved to be a very lucrative business for british universities : international students are estimated to bring in about £ 4bn a year to british universities and some £ 10bn to the economy as a whole .
numbers have been steadily rising for some years and there are now around 300,000 overseas students in the uk .
recent predictions have suggested the global market for international students will grow fast .
a recent major study , called " vision 2020 " , suggested there could be a tripling of demand in the uk by that date .
too hopeful on this optimistic outlook , that would mean 850,000 overseas students in the uk by 2020 .
however , a conference organised by the universities and colleges admissions service -lrb- ucas -rrb- this week suggested that this optimistic prediction could be just that - too hopeful .
the message was that the uk has been complacent and the international student market for british universities could be about to collapse .
if it does - on top of a slowing of domestic demand because of " top up " fees and demographic change - then universities face a bleak future .
we might not quite be into the territory of ghost campuses with grass growing up through deserted accommodation blocks , but there might have to be painful contraction .
the reason for the concern lies in the fact that the uk is now losing market share in the global student market .
why ?

they will show that the introduction of " top-up " fees is having an impact on the demand for university places in england .
however , soundings suggest they will be down by only a few percentage points which , after last 's year spike in demand , will not yet ring alarm bells or suggest school-leavers are abandoning the idea of going to university .
this will be a great relief to the government which , with its hands full on schools policy , would not welcome a re-run of concerns over the effects of higher university fees .
nevertheless these are anxious times for universities .
while student demand is healthy at present , there is a big demographic decline looming from 2010 when the number of 18-year-olds in the population goes into a long and steady decline .
at the same time , university leaders point out that the extra income from " top-up " fees will make only a marginal difference , as much of it will go on funding student bursaries .
despite predictions that " top-up " fees could rise to £ 5,000 , there is no chance of the £ 3,000 cap being raised before the promised review of student finance in 2009 .
that is why so many universities have been pinning their hopes on recruiting more international students who , providing they come from outside the eu , can be charged much higher fees .
so far this has proved to be a very lucrative business for british universities : international students are estimated to bring in about £ 4bn a year to british universities and some £ 10bn to the economy as a whole .
numbers have been steadily rising for some years and there are now around 300,000 overseas students in the uk .
recent predictions have suggested the global market for international students will grow fast .
a recent major study , called " vision 2020 " , suggested there could be a tripling of demand in the uk by that date .
too hopeful on this optimistic outlook , that would mean 850,000 overseas students in the uk by 2020 .
however , a conference organised by the universities and colleges admissions service -lrb- ucas -rrb- this week suggested that this optimistic prediction could be just that - too hopeful .
the message was that the uk has been complacent and the international student market for british universities could be about to collapse .
if it does - on top of a slowing of domestic demand because of " top up " fees and demographic change - then universities face a bleak future .
we might not quite be into the territory of ghost campuses with grass growing up through deserted accommodation blocks , but there might have to be painful contraction .
the reason for the concern lies in the fact that the uk is now losing market share in the global student market .
why ?
the answer is simple : competition is hotting up .
take china , for example .
last year , the number of uk student visa applications made in beijing fell by 38 % .
applications for this year are expected to be down at the same time , according to dr tim westlake , director of international development at manchester university , china has doubled its own undergraduate provision in the past five years .
that sort of growth makes uk university expansion look miniscule and it suggests a new policy in china of educating students at home .
elite chinese universities , like tsinghua , are now - according to dr westlake - opening campuses in other parts of that huge country in order to compete with the best universities in the world .
meanwhile the uk 's biggest competitors in the overseas market - the usa and australia - are both investing heavily in building their market share .
australia 's overseas student enrolment has doubled since 2000 .
new competition is also emerging from the far east and the middle east .
at present , the international student market is dominated by english-speaking countries .
the global dominance of the english language has given the uk , the usa , and australia a real competitive edge .
that is now under threat as universities in continental europe have started to provide courses for overseas students that are taught in english .
for example , dr westlake cites malaysia , which is sending medical students to russia where they are being taught in english .
so , just as british universities have started to rely heavily on the overseas market to sustain their over-stretched budgets , it seems the bubble could be about to burst .
overall , the number of overseas students rose by just 0.3 % a survey for universities uk shows that four out of five universities saw enrolments of overseas students decline in 2005 .
this is affecting the top universities too : a survey of universities in the elite russell group showed 60 % experienced a decline in overseas students last year .
overall , despite many universities budgeting for a big increase in overseas student income last year , the number of overseas students rose by just 0.3 % .
the irony is that this decline in the uk share of the global student market has happened in the very years when the prime minister has backed an initiative aimed at boosting overseas recruitment .
risk some of the government 's actions have not helped .
last summer the price of student visas doubled .
this hardly sent a welcoming signal to foreign students .
the risk now is that universities that have had their fingers burnt in the overseas markets will either withdraw , reduce their marketing investment , or attempt to reduce the quality of courses through cost-cutting .
however , as dr westlake has put it , success will depend on the " brand " .
british universities can not promise the sunshine and beaches of australia or the low cost of living of the usa .
so the unique selling points will have to be the quality of our degrees and the quality of the student experience .
that does not mean opening up overseas franchises or trying to accommodate overseas students on the cheap .

however , soundings suggest they will be down by only a few percentage points which , after last 's year spike in demand , will not yet ring alarm bells or suggest school-leavers are abandoning the idea of going to university .
this will be a great relief to the government which , with its hands full on schools policy , would not welcome a re-run of concerns over the effects of higher university fees .
nevertheless these are anxious times for universities .
while student demand is healthy at present , there is a big demographic decline looming from 2010 when the number of 18-year-olds in the population goes into a long and steady decline .
at the same time , university leaders point out that the extra income from " top-up " fees will make only a marginal difference , as much of it will go on funding student bursaries .
despite predictions that " top-up " fees could rise to £ 5,000 , there is no chance of the £ 3,000 cap being raised before the promised review of student finance in 2009 .
that is why so many universities have been pinning their hopes on recruiting more international students who , providing they come from outside the eu , can be charged much higher fees .
so far this has proved to be a very lucrative business for british universities : international students are estimated to bring in about £ 4bn a year to british universities and some £ 10bn to the economy as a whole .
numbers have been steadily rising for some years and there are now around 300,000 overseas students in the uk .
recent predictions have suggested the global market for international students will grow fast .
a recent major study , called " vision 2020 " , suggested there could be a tripling of demand in the uk by that date .
too hopeful on this optimistic outlook , that would mean 850,000 overseas students in the uk by 2020 .
however , a conference organised by the universities and colleges admissions service -lrb- ucas -rrb- this week suggested that this optimistic prediction could be just that - too hopeful .
the message was that the uk has been complacent and the international student market for british universities could be about to collapse .
if it does - on top of a slowing of domestic demand because of " top up " fees and demographic change - then universities face a bleak future .
we might not quite be into the territory of ghost campuses with grass growing up through deserted accommodation blocks , but there might have to be painful contraction .
the reason for the concern lies in the fact that the uk is now losing market share in the global student market .
why ?
the answer is simple : competition is hotting up .
take china , for example .
last year , the number of uk student visa applications made in beijing fell by 38 % .
applications for this year are expected to be down at the same time , according to dr tim westlake , director of international development at manchester university , china has doubled its own undergraduate provision in the past five years .
that sort of growth makes uk university expansion look miniscule and it suggests a new policy in china of educating students at home .
elite chinese universities , like tsinghua , are now - according to dr westlake - opening campuses in other parts of that huge country in order to compete with the best universities in the world .
meanwhile the uk 's biggest competitors in the overseas market - the usa and australia - are both investing heavily in building their market share .
australia 's overseas student enrolment has doubled since 2000 .
new competition is also emerging from the far east and the middle east .
at present , the international student market is dominated by english-speaking countries .
the global dominance of the english language has given the uk , the usa , and australia a real competitive edge .
that is now under threat as universities in continental europe have started to provide courses for overseas students that are taught in english .
for example , dr westlake cites malaysia , which is sending medical students to russia where they are being taught in english .
so , just as british universities have started to rely heavily on the overseas market to sustain their over-stretched budgets , it seems the bubble could be about to burst .
overall , the number of overseas students rose by just 0.3 % a survey for universities uk shows that four out of five universities saw enrolments of overseas students decline in 2005 .
this is affecting the top universities too : a survey of universities in the elite russell group showed 60 % experienced a decline in overseas students last year .
overall , despite many universities budgeting for a big increase in overseas student income last year , the number of overseas students rose by just 0.3 % .
the irony is that this decline in the uk share of the global student market has happened in the very years when the prime minister has backed an initiative aimed at boosting overseas recruitment .
risk some of the government 's actions have not helped .
last summer the price of student visas doubled .
this hardly sent a welcoming signal to foreign students .
the risk now is that universities that have had their fingers burnt in the overseas markets will either withdraw , reduce their marketing investment , or attempt to reduce the quality of courses through cost-cutting .
however , as dr westlake has put it , success will depend on the " brand " .
british universities can not promise the sunshine and beaches of australia or the low cost of living of the usa .
so the unique selling points will have to be the quality of our degrees and the quality of the student experience .
that does not mean opening up overseas franchises or trying to accommodate overseas students on the cheap .
providing british universities respond to the new competitive environment , overseas students will continue to be an important ingredient in british universities .
but they are not going to be the financial panacea that some had hoped .

billie hunter has been made professor of midwifery at swansea university , the first such role in wales .
she said she hopes to influence policy in wales ' maternity services , including reducing the caesarean rate and combating a shortage of midwives .
since 1996 , the number of women having caesarean births in wales has risen from 19 % to nearly 24 % .
' emotional problems ' the figure in wales is higher than in england , where 22.7 % of birth were caesarean according to the most recent 2003-4 figures .
professor hunter told bbc wales that while caesareans were often necessary , women frequently chose to have them because they were " frightened " . "
midwives do n't go into it for the pay - it 's about job satisfaction " professor billy hunter she added : " if it 's an emergency caesarean or there 's a clinical need , then it 's appropriate .
" but we find that women may have physical or emotional problems after having a caesarean when it was n't needed .
" my impression is that women are frightened about childbirth , they are frightened of pain and they consider a caesarean as an option . "
she said she thought there was more midwives could do to help ease women 's fears over natural childbirth , adding : " the relationship between midwives and women is key . "
' influence policy ' prof hunter , 52 , is wales ' first professor of midwifery and one of only about a dozen in the uk .
after working in midwifery for 25 years , prof hunter said her new role was to carry out research into maternity issues in wales , but also to educate midwives and parents on choices .
she added that she hoped to influence policy on maternity issues .
prof hunter said : " my main role will be research - finding out more about maternity care in wales , understanding the issues and then helping to improve it .
" there 's still lots we do n't know about having a baby and the experience of women who are having a baby . "
as well as the increasing rate of caesarean births in wales , prof hunter said maternity services also faced problems of staff shortages .
' burned out ' she said : " there 's a big problem of recruitment and retention of midwives in wales , as elsewhere .
" they get stressed and burned out after a couple of years .
i need to find out why that is and help to stop it from happening .
" midwives do n't go into it for the pay - it 's about job satisfaction . "
economic and social problems also affected maternity care in wales , prof hunter added .
" the biggest overall problem in wales is inequality in health , " she said .
home birth " it all starts with birth and how a baby is nourished in the womb has a major impact on that baby 's life chances .
" if a midwife can get there early and influence what people eat and how they look after themselves then it can help at a very early stage .
" there 's scope for projects working with people in economically-deprived areas , ethnic groups or asylum seekers . "
but prof hunter said she was " excited " to be taking up herrole , saying wales was leading the way in some areas .
" there are more midwife-led birth units starting up and there is a policy to increase home birth to 10 % of the total . "

the black and white prints of machynys and bwlch-y-gwynt were taken by the late david hopkins who grew up there .
the land once occupied by the terraced houses and tinplate works is now an 18-hole championship golf course .
mr hopkins ' brother gerald donated the photos to the town 's historical society which digitally enhanced them for an exhibition due to be held on monday .
south llanelli was once dominated by steel and tinplate works but as the town 's industrial base declined - many of the factories disappeared .
my brother died at the age of 37 so i 'm pleased they are being shown gerald hopkins during the 1960s families were moved out of machynys and bwlch-y-gwynt , many into council houses in the town , as the local authority started to draw up plans to redevelop the area .
mr hopkins said the hamlets , where he and his brother grew up , were once made up of more than 100 homes and had their own school as well as the surrounding industries .
" everybody knew everybody and it was very friendly .
no-one ever locked their doors , " he added .
although by the 1970s the area had been flattened it was to be more than 30 years before new developments took place .
last year a new 18-hole championship golf course designed by gary nicklaus , son of golf legend jack , opened .
the two hamlets have gone and a golf course has taken their place close to 200 homes are also being built .
" when i go down there now to walk the dog i look for landmarks for where our house was but i ca n't find it because it has changed so much , " said mr hopkins .
he is full of praise for what has taken their place but still misses the lost communities - although he has his brother 's photographs as a reminder .
" he took a lot of photographs growing up .
he died at the age of 37 so i 'm pleased they are being shown , " mr hopkins added .
two years ago , dozens of former residents from machynys and bwlch-y-gwynt held a reunion and mr hopkins is hoping many of them will be at monday 's showing .
the exhibition lost communities will be held at 1930 gmt in llanelli 's selwyn samuel centre on monday , 13 february .

but despite its huge energy reserves and potential wealth , millions of people live in extreme poverty .
nigeria is the eighth biggest oil exporter in the world each nigerian state has its own number plate slogan .
lagos , the pulsating home to 15 million-odd people , traffic jams and frequent armed robberies , is the centre of excellence , while delta state has the tagline the big heart .
this , i was later told by a delta resident , is because of the courage of its people .
for 50 years oil has been pumped from beneath the creeks , swamps and forests of the delta , an area about the size of scotland .
it has earned the nigerian government billions of pounds .
yet the communities in the delta say they continue to live in poverty .
most of the promised development projects , like schools , roads and electricity supplies , have failed to materialise .
instead , they say , their land and water have been polluted by oil spills and their air ruined by the constant burning-off of natural gas .
there is an apocryphal story often told about the origin of the disquiet in the delta .
there are plenty of guns in nigeria and plenty of gunmen in the delta in the 1990s the then military ruler , sani abacha , invited people from the delta to the new purpose-built capital , abuja .
when they saw its huge , well-ordered roads , bridges and high-rise buildings , they realised what the oil money could do , and how little of it they saw .

oil theft thieves use boats to transport oil stolen from wells and pipelines there are plenty of guns in nigeria and plenty of gunmen in the delta .
some are interested in the political conflict , some in robbery and extortion .
some , according to human rights groups , are paid and armed by politicians to help rig elections .
then there is the highly lucrative and illegal business of oil bunkering , the siphoning-off of oil from well heads and pipelines to sell on the black market .
it is a racket estimated to be worth several billion pounds a year .
and it is a large , well-run and at times an international operation .
last year , two nigerian rear admirals were court-martialled for their part in the attempted theft of thousands of tons of nigerian oil by an international crime syndicate operating in eastern europe .
river maze despite the money generated from oil , many people still live in poverty in the unspectacular sprawl of concrete buildings that is the town of warri , i met a tall young boat captain called henry .
he was dressed immaculately in chinos and a white shirt .
he held a mobile phone in one hand , and a bible in the other .
like many , he had just spent his sunday morning in church .
he assured me it was safe to go onto the waterways .
up to a point .
we sped along the river in a thin wooden boat heading deeper into the delta , skipping over the brown salt water dotted with the floating green clumps of water hyacinths .
africa have your say can alternative sources of energy really meet africa 's needs ?
send us your comments both banks , about a mile apart , were lined with dense green mangrove forests .
occasionally a clearing would reveal a small village of wooden huts and canoes pulled up on the muddy banks .
and on the horizon , a plume of orange flame marked the site of an oil installation burning off natural gas .
creeks and inlets snaked off from the river in all directions , forming the maze of the delta , accessible only to those with local knowledge .
undelivered promises after 40 minutes we arrived at the village of ekirimo .
its concrete jetty , the villagers insisted , was one of the few development projects they had seen reach fruition .
we walked along sandy paths , among huts of driftwood , thatched palm fronds and rusting corrugated iron , to the village chairman 's hut to introduce ourselves .
the village was called to a meeting .
they decided we could stay .
the chairman , john grisbe , was a short man who looked to be in his fifties .
he had a broad grizzled face and sparkling eyes .
fishing was their livelihood , but most of the fish had gone away , they said , because of a barge , sunk near the village which was leaking oil he eloquently detailed their many grievances .
no clean water , no electricity , shacks falling into disrepair , unemployment .
and he said they had received scant help .
the young men of the village took us to see what he was talking about .
they showed us the brackish well , the half-completed school - another promised , but undelivered , development project .
they showed us the oil-damaged nets .
fishing was their livelihood , but most of the fish had gone away , they said , because of a barge sunk near the village which was leaking oil .
everyone we talked to condemned the violence and kidnappings .
some said it undermined their struggle to get greater local control of the oil wealth .
but many also understood why the violence took place .
as one local councillor told me , unless there is development , year after year , we will have more killings and kidnappings .
from the banks of the river , we watched as a line of six small nigerian navy patrol boats passed by the village , heading back to their base in warri - the military 's attempts to ensure security for the oil operations .
as we ourselves headed back up the river , we rounded a bend to see the same patrol boats floundering in mid-stream , stuck on one of the hidden sandbanks .
a reminder that in the end , the gunmen know the delta , the military do not .

but despite its huge energy reserves and potential wealth , millions of people live in extreme poverty .
nigeria is the eighth biggest oil exporter in the world each nigerian state has its own number plate slogan .
lagos , the pulsating home to 15 million-odd people , traffic jams and frequent armed robberies , is the centre of excellence , while delta state has the tagline the big heart .
this , i was later told by a delta resident , is because of the courage of its people .
for 50 years oil has been pumped from beneath the creeks , swamps and forests of the delta , an area about the size of scotland .
it has earned the nigerian government billions of pounds .
yet the communities in the delta say they continue to live in poverty .
most of the promised development projects , like schools , roads and electricity supplies , have failed to materialise .
instead , they say , their land and water have been polluted by oil spills and their air ruined by the constant burning-off of natural gas .
there is an apocryphal story often told about the origin of the disquiet in the delta .
there are plenty of guns in nigeria and plenty of gunmen in the delta in the 1990s the then military ruler , sani abacha , invited people from the delta to the new purpose-built capital , abuja .
when they saw its huge , well-ordered roads , bridges and high-rise buildings , they realised what the oil money could do , and how little of it they saw .
and so the trouble began .
oil theft thieves use boats to transport oil stolen from wells and pipelines there are plenty of guns in nigeria and plenty of gunmen in the delta .
some are interested in the political conflict , some in robbery and extortion .
some , according to human rights groups , are paid and armed by politicians to help rig elections .
then there is the highly lucrative and illegal business of oil bunkering , the siphoning-off of oil from well heads and pipelines to sell on the black market .
it is a racket estimated to be worth several billion pounds a year .
and it is a large , well-run and at times an international operation .
last year , two nigerian rear admirals were court-martialled for their part in the attempted theft of thousands of tons of nigerian oil by an international crime syndicate operating in eastern europe .
river maze despite the money generated from oil , many people still live in poverty in the unspectacular sprawl of concrete buildings that is the town of warri , i met a tall young boat captain called henry .
he was dressed immaculately in chinos and a white shirt .
he held a mobile phone in one hand , and a bible in the other .
like many , he had just spent his sunday morning in church .
he assured me it was safe to go onto the waterways .
up to a point .
we sped along the river in a thin wooden boat heading deeper into the delta , skipping over the brown salt water dotted with the floating green clumps of water hyacinths .
africa have your say can alternative sources of energy really meet africa 's needs ?
send us your comments both banks , about a mile apart , were lined with dense green mangrove forests .
occasionally a clearing would reveal a small village of wooden huts and canoes pulled up on the muddy banks .
and on the horizon , a plume of orange flame marked the site of an oil installation burning off natural gas .
creeks and inlets snaked off from the river in all directions , forming the maze of the delta , accessible only to those with local knowledge .
undelivered promises after 40 minutes we arrived at the village of ekirimo .
its concrete jetty , the villagers insisted , was one of the few development projects they had seen reach fruition .
we walked along sandy paths , among huts of driftwood , thatched palm fronds and rusting corrugated iron , to the village chairman 's hut to introduce ourselves .
the village was called to a meeting .
they decided we could stay .
the chairman , john grisbe , was a short man who looked to be in his fifties .
he had a broad grizzled face and sparkling eyes .
fishing was their livelihood , but most of the fish had gone away , they said , because of a barge , sunk near the village which was leaking oil he eloquently detailed their many grievances .
no clean water , no electricity , shacks falling into disrepair , unemployment .
and he said they had received scant help .
the young men of the village took us to see what he was talking about .
they showed us the brackish well , the half-completed school - another promised , but undelivered , development project .
they showed us the oil-damaged nets .
fishing was their livelihood , but most of the fish had gone away , they said , because of a barge sunk near the village which was leaking oil .
everyone we talked to condemned the violence and kidnappings .
some said it undermined their struggle to get greater local control of the oil wealth .
but many also understood why the violence took place .
as one local councillor told me , unless there is development , year after year , we will have more killings and kidnappings .
from the banks of the river , we watched as a line of six small nigerian navy patrol boats passed by the village , heading back to their base in warri - the military 's attempts to ensure security for the oil operations .
as we ourselves headed back up the river , we rounded a bend to see the same patrol boats floundering in mid-stream , stuck on one of the hidden sandbanks .
a reminder that in the end , the gunmen know the delta , the military do not .

much of the criticism has come from madrid , but as nick caistor reports , it has not taken the catalans by surprise .
it has been snowing in catalonia .
in the vineyards south of barcelona , you can almost see the black vine stumps shivering .
the hills up behind the city are blanketed in white , which makes the mediterranean down below seem even bluer .
eduardo , a catalan writer friend of mine , has brought me to the top of the mountain called tibidabo to admire the view .
he explains the legend behind its name , which means " all this i give you " .
the catalans claim this has a biblical origin : it was here that the devil brought jesus to tempt him with all the riches of the earth if he renounced his faith .
ever since , the rest of the world - and in particular the spaniards elsewhere in the country - have been jealous of all that catalonia has to offer .
nowhere is there more jealousy , they say , than in the spanish capital , madrid , which has no sea , no mountains , but most of the political power .
for 40 years during the franco regime , catalonia was made to suffer .
the catalan language was forbidden in schools and in the street .
catalan political organisations were banned , and the organised labour movement that was still strong in barcelona suffered violent repression .
catalonia had a military governor appointed from madrid , and troops from the rest of spain were stationed there .
after the return of democratic rule in the 1970s , catalonia , like other regions of spain , was given a statute of autonomy .
this allowed the catalans to appoint their own police force and created a national assembly with powers to decide judicial , health and educational matters .
the catalan language was officially recognised once more and taught again in schools .
push for independence the spanish socialist party returned to power in 2004 , while , at the same time , a left-wing coalition won a majority in the catalan assembly .
barcelona pushed for a new and wider statute of autonomy .
the regional assembly voted for this new statute by an overwhelming majority .
this would not only give it greater powers of taxation , but would acknowledge that catalonia is a separate " nation " .
the legislation was then sent to madrid for consideration by the national parliament , which also approved it late last year .
this was too much for many on the right of spanish politics .
in january this year , the head of the army , general mena aguado , told fellow officers that if catalonia was to declare its independence , this meant that spanish troops had the right to invade it to defend spain 's interests there .
my friend eduardo told me that when his grandmother heard this , she had started stocking up with tinned food and other supplies , in case barcelona was blockaded as it had been 70 years ago .
most catalans did not go to such extremes , but were genuinely horrified at the knee-jerk authoritarian reaction still prevalent in some of spain 's key institutions .
rallying point general mena was immediately sacked , but the damage had been done .
right-wing politicians jumped on the bandwagon , thinking that this kind of nationalism might be a new rallying point after their defeat in elections almost two years ago .
some of the spanish press called for a boycott of catalan goods such as their cava , or champagne , as well as agricultural produce and industrial goods .
the conflict between the catalan authorities and central spain was also brought to the fore in another recent confrontation .
at the end of the civil war , general franco ordered a huge investigation into anyone who could be considered an opponent of his regime - from communists to folk dancers .
all the files on these people have been stored ever since in salamanca . "
the next morning in barcelona , all the snow had gone , and the sky seemed to promise spring " when the catalan authorities demanded the return of these records recently , the high court at first dismissed the idea , although this too was rectified later .
the main argument employed was the one always heard - if we allow the catalans to do it , where will it end - the basques , the galicians will all want the same treatment .
to which my catalan friends reply : so what ?
the next morning in barcelona , all the snow had gone , and the sky seemed to promise spring .
i went with my friends to have lunch in one of the small restaurants that have somehow survived all the attempts to smarten up the city for the 1992 olympics and the new millennium .
over our typical catalan meal , starting with bread smeared with tomato , followed by fried catalan fish , catalan vegetables and meat , and ending with catalan custard , my companions laughed at the idea that the recognition of the new statute would cause real trouble with madrid .
they took the quarrel back not just 70 years to the civil war , but shrugged their shoulders and said : " the spaniards have been envious of us for 800 years at least .
" let them get on with it . "

much of the criticism has come from madrid , but as nick caistor reports , it has not taken the catalans by surprise .
the catalan proposals have provoked heated debate in spain it has been snowing in catalonia .
in the vineyards south of barcelona , you can almost see the black vine stumps shivering .
the hills up behind the city are blanketed in white , which makes the mediterranean down below seem even bluer .
eduardo , a catalan writer friend of mine , has brought me to the top of the mountain called tibidabo to admire the view .
he explains the legend behind its name , which means " all this i give you " .
the catalans claim this has a biblical origin : it was here that the devil brought jesus to tempt him with all the riches of the earth if he renounced his faith .
ever since , the rest of the world - and in particular the spaniards elsewhere in the country - have been jealous of all that catalonia has to offer .
nowhere is there more jealousy , they say , than in the spanish capital , madrid , which has no sea , no mountains , but most of the political power .
for 40 years during the franco regime , catalonia was made to suffer .
the catalan language was forbidden in schools and in the street .
catalan political organisations were banned , and the organised labour movement that was still strong in barcelona suffered violent repression .
catalonia had a military governor appointed from madrid , and troops from the rest of spain were stationed there .
after the return of democratic rule in the 1970s , catalonia , like other regions of spain , was given a statute of autonomy .
this allowed the catalans to appoint their own police force and created a national assembly with powers to decide judicial , health and educational matters .
the catalan language was officially recognised once more and taught again in schools .
push for independence the spanish socialist party returned to power in 2004 , while , at the same time , a left-wing coalition won a majority in the catalan assembly .
barcelona pushed for a new and wider statute of autonomy .
spain 's parliament approved plans for greater autonomy in november the regional assembly voted for this new statute by an overwhelming majority .
this would not only give it greater powers of taxation , but would acknowledge that catalonia is a separate " nation " .
the legislation was then sent to madrid for consideration by the national parliament , which also approved it late last year .
this was too much for many on the right of spanish politics .
in january this year , the head of the army , general mena aguado , told fellow officers that if catalonia was to declare its independence , this meant that spanish troops had the right to invade it to defend spain 's interests there .
my friend eduardo told me that when his grandmother heard this , she had started stocking up with tinned food and other supplies , in case barcelona was blockaded as it had been 70 years ago .
most catalans did not go to such extremes , but were genuinely horrified at the knee-jerk authoritarian reaction still prevalent in some of spain 's key institutions .
rallying point general mena was immediately sacked , but the damage had been done .
right-wing politicians jumped on the bandwagon , thinking that this kind of nationalism might be a new rallying point after their defeat in elections almost two years ago .
some of the spanish press called for a boycott of catalan goods such as their cava , or champagne , as well as agricultural produce and industrial goods .
the conflict between the catalan authorities and central spain was also brought to the fore in another recent confrontation .
at the end of the civil war , general franco ordered a huge investigation into anyone who could be considered an opponent of his regime - from communists to folk dancers .
all the files on these people have been stored ever since in salamanca .
the next morning in barcelona , all the snow had gone , and the sky seemed to promise spring when the catalan authorities demanded the return of these records recently , the high court at first dismissed the idea , although this too was rectified later .
the main argument employed was the one always heard - if we allow the catalans to do it , where will it end - the basques , the galicians will all want the same treatment .
to which my catalan friends reply : so what ?
the next morning in barcelona , all the snow had gone , and the sky seemed to promise spring .
i went with my friends to have lunch in one of the small restaurants that have somehow survived all the attempts to smarten up the city for the 1992 olympics and the new millennium .
over our typical catalan meal , starting with bread smeared with tomato , followed by fried catalan fish , catalan vegetables and meat , and ending with catalan custard , my companions laughed at the idea that the recognition of the new statute would cause real trouble with madrid .
they took the quarrel back not just 70 years to the civil war , but shrugged their shoulders and said : " the spaniards have been envious of us for 800 years at least .
" let them get on with it . "

but officials from the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- nations said they still believed that growth would be good this year , in a statement issued after talks .
finance chiefs have been meeting in moscow this weekend with energy security at the top of their agenda .
russia has taken the helm of g8 with its economic clout at an all-time high .
in their final communique , the g8 ministers also : called for aid to developing countries battling the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu pressed for more action to advance world trade organization talks aimed at opening up international trade vowed to step up the fight against networks which finance terrorism .
russian energy boost correspondents say oil prices and energy security dominated russia 's first hosting of g8 policymakers - from britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the us .
as energy importers , most of the g8 members are alarmed by the way oil and gas prices have been sent rocketing by record demand and political instability in places such as iraq , iran and nigeria .
they have seen rising fuel prices stoke inflation , pushing up business costs and dampening consumer spending .
and they have noticed that rising energy prices have been good for russia , which has big reserves of oil and gas .
energy exports helped its economy grow by more than 6 % last year .
these exports , and the other g8 nations ' reliance on them , are increasingly enabling russia 's president , vladimir putin , to take a more aggressive stance on how the russian economy is run .
this was reinforced last month by russia 's dispute with ukraine over gas supplies .
it disrupted supplies in other nations downstream from ukraine on the gas pipeline used to bring russia 's gas exports to the west .

but managers are now hoping for an end to the problems , the new timetable has all three ferries on at peak periods , two during the day and evening and one overnight .
