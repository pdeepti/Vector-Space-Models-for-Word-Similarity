less than half of what 's exhibited are books in the classic form - printed on paper and bound .
much on show consists of bits and bytes . the global digital boom poses all sorts of challenges for the traditional book market .
audio books , films , toys , writing utensils and electronic media are taking center-stage more and more at the frankfurt book fair .
from picture books that speak to bilingual learning software , digital media for children is regularly on show in frankfurt . just a few years ago , electronic publishing had its own place in a separate exhibition hall at the book fair - far removed from the classic books printed on paper .
book exhibitors used to eye the products skeptically - but not anymore . digital books now find their place among those on paper .
thirty percent of the products on show this year in frankfurt are digital works .
digital future some publishers are even completely focusing their efforts on the so-called internet generation . " the future is in mobile learning , " said armin hopp , who established his munich-based language media company called " digital publishing " 10 years ago .
hopp said his firm had , since then , developed into europe 's leading producer of language learning software .
the different materials it produces , including software , can be saved on usb sticks and other forms of portable digital storage devices .
the company also provides online tutors , decreasing the need for language textbooks . electronic libraries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are books traditionally printed on paper being squeezed out of the market ?
another huge challenge facing the book market is publishing on the internet .
frightened by the notion that search engine google wants to allow free access to entire libraries on the web , german publishers have started a counter-offensive .
the german publishers and booksellers association aims to launch its own online platform in early 2007 .
from bestselling novels to non-fiction , everything is to be digitized and offered to readers online .
they will be able to read excerpts or entire books , for which , however , they will have to pay . science databanks then there are specialized solutions .
springer science , for instance , presented the largest scientific e-book program to date , in frankfurt .
the publisher 's customers include libraries , which can buy works online at reasonable prices . despite the company 's product line , olaf ernst , head of the e-book program at springer science , disagreed with the widespread notion that online books would cause fewer printed books to be sold . " a printed book is still used differently than an electronic one , " said .
" the electronic area works kind of like a databank , in which you search and find something .
once you find it , you then go to the printed book , because you can work with it better , " he said . ernst 's clientele in particular was unlikely to make the switch , he said .
scientists like to leaf through books , and it 's still easier to do that with printed literature , he said . gabriela schaaf -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair opens with focus on india , digital publishing the world 's biggest book fair opened in frankfurt on tuesday evening , shining a spotlight on the flourishing literary scene in guest country india and the rise of the internet as a challenge to the printed word .

audio books , films , toys , writing utensils and electronic media are taking center-stage more and more at the frankfurt book fair .
from picture books that speak to bilingual learning software , digital media for children is regularly on show in frankfurt . just a few years ago , electronic publishing had its own place in a separate exhibition hall at the book fair - far removed from the classic books printed on paper .

" a printed book is still used differently than an electronic one , " said .
" the electronic area works kind of like a databank , in which you search and find something .
once you find it , you then go to the printed book , because you can work with it better , " he said . ernst 's clientele in particular was unlikely to make the switch , he said .

the stereotypical smoky french bistro could soon be an image of the past if a parliamentary recommendation to ban smoking in public places is adopted in france . the government is expected to make a decision on the proposal by mid-october .
if a ban is announced , france would join other european countries , with similar bans including ireland , britain , spain and italy . french government 's indecision over smoking ban polls regularly show that a majority of the french support a ban on smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking and passive smoking kills more than 70,000 people in france each year however , weakened by a battle with labor unions and students over a controversial youth employment law , the french government backed down in april from a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants to avoid a clash with france 's die-hard smokers and the cigarette industry . according to government figures , some 35 percent of the french population use tobacco , but the statistics also show that smoking kills 66,000 smokers in france each year while a further 5,000 people die from passive smoking . if the ban is agreed to , french smokers will have to make drastic adjustments as the new rule recommends smoking be completely prohibited unless an establishment can provide hermetically-sealed " fumoirs , " which serving staff would not enter . the government is currently ignoring the outcry from the bar and tobacco lobby , which is warning of the dire financial consequences if the ban comes into effect . panel recommends total ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banning smoking has been advised by the parliamentary panel after five months of consultations with doctors , tobacconists and trade unions , the 30-member parliamentary panel decided in favor of a blanket ban . the report also advised the government to resort to a decree to enact the ban rather than a law , which it said could then become an unwanted campaign issue in the run-up to the 2007 presidential elections . moves to prohibit public smoking in france reflect the changing mood across much of europe where several countries have introduced similar measures , including italy , sweden , ukraine , britain and spain . germany , one of the last bastions of smoking in western europe , meanwhile is slowly warming up to a ban in public places .
but a proposed bill expected to enter parliament in the fall has already been watered down because of pressure from the tobacco lobby . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government accused of bowing to tobacco lobby after announcing it will drop plans to enforce a full ban on smoking in restaurants , germany 's ruling coalition came under fire from the greens who accused the government of bowing to pressure from the tobacco lobby .

small publishers , though , have a tough time paying the high fees .
they have to be inventive . berlin-based verbrecher verlag has rented a stand measuring four square meters -lrb- 13 square feet -rrb- at the frankfurt book fair .

four-square-meter spaces cost around 700 euros -lrb- $ 887 -rrb- ; portable walls cost extra . for a tiny publisher like the cologne-based firwitz verlag - which has only published three books in all - such rates , plus costs for accommodations and food , are insurmountable . of the over 7,200 exhibitors presenting their books at the fair , the smaller publishers often have to work together .
forty-two of them pooled their resources , for instance , to rent a joint stand as part of the arbeitskreis kleinerer unabhängiger verlage -lrb- working group of small , independent publishers -rrb- , or akv .
at the stand , the publishers at least have one meter of wall space to present their books . idealism and a passion for books may be what motivates the small publishers , since sales are usually minimal .
firwitz verlag did not sell more books following its exhibition at last year 's book fair , it said . what the mini-publishers are hoping for is a big hit . " we 're all hoping for a bestseller like patrick süskind 's perfume , " verbrecher verlag 's jörg sundermeier told german news agency dpa . the small think big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to compete with " the big guys " ?

in 1998 , it landed a bestseller with corinne hofmann 's autobiography " die weisse massai " -lrb- the white massai -rrb- , which was later adapted into a film .
it allowed the house to breathe more easily , publisher albert völkmann told ap .
" we could stop exploiting ourselves , " he said . a1 was founded 15 years ago .
now it employs five people and publishes around 10 books a year .
" our biggest problem , " said völkmann , " is getting space for our books in stores . "
he said a1 's books are often overshadowed by the bestsellers on bookstore shelves . in their struggle for recognition , the smaller publishers try to help each other out .
verbrecher verlag apparently recommended an author to another small publisher , berlin-based tropen verlag .
verbrecher publishers could not agree on payment with the author but felt he should be published , so they suggested him to tropen . tropen verlag has also had success with publishing translations of famous authors , such as american writer jonathan lethem . yet few of the tiny publishers catch that big fish .

" i was provoked , but that should still not happen and there can be no excuses , " podolski said . khizanishvili joined podolski in the dressing room 14 minutes later when he was shown a second yellow card for a tackle from behind on mike hanke . goals in each half from bastian schweinsteiger and germany captain michael ballack gave coach joachim löw his fourth successive victory since succeeding jürgen klinsmann after the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi had more to celebrate in the last match against ireland ballack set schweinsteiger up to strike a superb distance shot into the top of the net in the 24th minute to put germany in front . the bayern player then returned the favor by providing the pass to ballack who left-footed the second in the 67th minute in a spell of german pressure after both teams had been reduced to 10 men . still things to talk about in german locker room " it was an entertaining game and we made some mistakes but we had four players playing for the first time and a lot of young players in the side , " löw said .
" we played with a lot of heart , but we will have to talk about some things with the team . " löw said the red card for podolski was " a logical consequence " of the kick on khizanishvili . " he is a young player but this is something we will have to talk about internally , " löw said .
" it 's the sort of thing that should not happen . " bildunterschrift : clemens fritz , jan schlaudraff and piotr trochowski , from left new hands get first caps werder bremen defender clemens fritz and hamburg midfielder piotr trochowski were two new caps in an inexperienced-looking germany team lacking several established players . aachen striker jan schlaudraff and wolfsburg defender alexander madlung of wolfsburg also earned first caps when they came on during the second half for hanke and manuel friedrich respectively . georgia could thank goergi lomaia for keeping his side in the match , but the visitors also came close to scoring in the first half after a hesitant start by the germans .

it 's a far cry from the bustle and excitement of that great iftar , the muslim evening meal that breaks the month of day-long fasting . two dozen men have gathered to eat a more modest iftar meal .
the group , mostly turkish-born but with a pakistani and bosnian among them , serve themselves meat dishes and fragrant rice with sliced almonds .
they wait for the moment of sunset on the day 's ramadan calendar and then each eats the customary date to start the meal . it does not take long for the ground-floor room to empty as they finish eating .
some move away quietly to pray and others go out to chat in the social room .
outside , most of the population is not even aware that the annual fasting month is happening . this is a part of germany , said one man , where the locals keep to themselves and consider themselves sociable if they greet a neighbor and say nothing else all day . bringing ramadan to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally ramadan is broken with dates , like the ones from this market in turkey the television coverage from turkey has invoked a feeling of yearning in some of the men to feel " at home , " to be among up to 15,000 guests breaking their fast in great tents in istanbul that are set up every year by rich benefactors and open to all comers , every evening of ramadan . at ramadan night prayers , the car park is full as 80 men and boys gather in a capacious loft that has been converted into the mosque 's main prayer room .
the leaders of the community , affiliated to the semi-official turkish religious body ditib , are proud of the center that opened in 1991 with the mosque , a shop , travel agency and social center on a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 43,000-square-feet -rrb- site with a big garden next to a wooded stream . mehmet demirbilek , a courier driver who was born near the black sea coast of turkey and came to germany in 1972 , said the official membership list of only 140 at the center belies its true influence in this area of germany . continuing the tradition the mosque is located in norderstedt , a town of schleswig-holstein state that is mainly a dormitory for the big nearby city of hamburg .
if the outlying areas of hamburg are included , an estimated 1,400 turks live in the area .
with arab and other muslims included , perhaps the number is 2,000 , and this mosque is open to all of them , he said . no one knows how many of these are observing the ramadan fast and ending the day with an iftar in the privacy of their own homes .
there is an uncomfortable silence when they are asked about westernized muslims who ignore the custom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramadan events in germany are smaller-scale " in islam , we are not supposed to judge others , " said 55-year-old nuri ahrens , an auto repairer who has lived in germany for the past 20 years . while most of the men at the iftar are single , or away from their wives , ahrens has left his wife at home for a women 's iftar .

" my heart has grown cold in this place " for those seeking the most sumptuous iftar meals , the big city of hamburg has restaurants that serve halal food approved by islam , but it is hard to get a seat at an iftar table : during ramadan , the restaurants are booked out months in advance . amid the companionship of the men 's nightly meal , some of the talk becomes a cry from the heart against the german society where they live .
one young man who has been a university student in the state capital kiel said he has resolved to move home to turkey . " if you were to take out my heart , you would find nothing but love there , " he said .

less than half of what 's exhibited are books in the classic form - printed on paper and bound .
much on show consists of bits and bytes . the global digital boom poses all sorts of challenges for the traditional book market .
audio books , films , toys , writing utensils and electronic media are taking center-stage more and more at the frankfurt book fair .
from picture books that speak to bilingual learning software , digital media for children is regularly on show in frankfurt . just a few years ago , electronic publishing had its own place in a separate exhibition hall at the book fair - far removed from the classic books printed on paper .
book exhibitors used to eye the products skeptically - but not anymore . digital books now find their place among those on paper .
thirty percent of the products on show this year in frankfurt are digital works .
digital future some publishers are even completely focusing their efforts on the so-called internet generation . " the future is in mobile learning , " said armin hopp , who established his munich-based language media company called " digital publishing " 10 years ago .
hopp said his firm had , since then , developed into europe 's leading producer of language learning software .
the different materials it produces , including software , can be saved on usb sticks and other forms of portable digital storage devices .
the company also provides online tutors , decreasing the need for language textbooks . electronic libraries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are books traditionally printed on paper being squeezed out of the market ?
another huge challenge facing the book market is publishing on the internet .
frightened by the notion that search engine google wants to allow free access to entire libraries on the web , german publishers have started a counter-offensive .
the german publishers and booksellers association aims to launch its own online platform in early 2007 .
from bestselling novels to non-fiction , everything is to be digitized and offered to readers online .
they will be able to read excerpts or entire books , for which , however , they will have to pay . science databanks then there are specialized solutions .
springer science , for instance , presented the largest scientific e-book program to date , in frankfurt .
the publisher 's customers include libraries , which can buy works online at reasonable prices . despite the company 's product line , olaf ernst , head of the e-book program at springer science , disagreed with the widespread notion that online books would cause fewer printed books to be sold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 08.10.2006 breaking the ramadan fast in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparing for iftar ramadan might not be as present in germany as in predominantly muslim countries , but throughout the country and even in the smallest towns , people gather together to break the fast . at a mosque in germany 's northern-most state of schleswig-holstein , the men 's eyes sparkle for a moment as they watch pictures on turkish television of thousands of people ending the ramadan fast for the day in istanbul .
it 's a far cry from the bustle and excitement of that great iftar , the muslim evening meal that breaks the month of day-long fasting . two dozen men have gathered to eat a more modest iftar meal .
the group , mostly turkish-born but with a pakistani and bosnian among them , serve themselves meat dishes and fragrant rice with sliced almonds .
they wait for the moment of sunset on the day 's ramadan calendar and then each eats the customary date to start the meal . it does not take long for the ground-floor room to empty as they finish eating .
some move away quietly to pray and others go out to chat in the social room .
outside , most of the population is not even aware that the annual fasting month is happening . this is a part of germany , said one man , where the locals keep to themselves and consider themselves sociable if they greet a neighbor and say nothing else all day . bringing ramadan to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally ramadan is broken with dates , like the ones from this market in turkey the television coverage from turkey has invoked a feeling of yearning in some of the men to feel " at home , " to be among up to 15,000 guests breaking their fast in great tents in istanbul that are set up every year by rich benefactors and open to all comers , every evening of ramadan . at ramadan night prayers , the car park is full as 80 men and boys gather in a capacious loft that has been converted into the mosque 's main prayer room .
the leaders of the community , affiliated to the semi-official turkish religious body ditib , are proud of the center that opened in 1991 with the mosque , a shop , travel agency and social center on a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 43,000-square-feet -rrb- site with a big garden next to a wooded stream . mehmet demirbilek , a courier driver who was born near the black sea coast of turkey and came to germany in 1972 , said the official membership list of only 140 at the center belies its true influence in this area of germany . continuing the tradition the mosque is located in norderstedt , a town of schleswig-holstein state that is mainly a dormitory for the big nearby city of hamburg .
if the outlying areas of hamburg are included , an estimated 1,400 turks live in the area .
with arab and other muslims included , perhaps the number is 2,000 , and this mosque is open to all of them , he said . no one knows how many of these are observing the ramadan fast and ending the day with an iftar in the privacy of their own homes .
there is an uncomfortable silence when they are asked about westernized muslims who ignore the custom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramadan events in germany are smaller-scale " in islam , we are not supposed to judge others , " said 55-year-old nuri ahrens , an auto repairer who has lived in germany for the past 20 years . while most of the men at the iftar are single , or away from their wives , ahrens has left his wife at home for a women 's iftar . " she invites other women around to the place in the evening , " he added . " my heart has grown cold in this place " for those seeking the most sumptuous iftar meals , the big city of hamburg has restaurants that serve halal food approved by islam , but it is hard to get a seat at an iftar table : during ramadan , the restaurants are booked out months in advance . amid the companionship of the men 's nightly meal , some of the talk becomes a cry from the heart against the german society where they live .
one young man who has been a university student in the state capital kiel said he has resolved to move home to turkey . " if you were to take out my heart , you would find nothing but love there , " he said .
" i have no hate .
but my heart has grown cold in this place . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's muslim of choice he 's the man eu officials and journalists alike seek out when islam and western europe do n't see eye-to-eye .

it 's a far cry from the bustle and excitement of that great iftar , the muslim evening meal that breaks the month of day-long fasting . two dozen men have gathered to eat a more modest iftar meal .
the group , mostly turkish-born but with a pakistani and bosnian among them , serve themselves meat dishes and fragrant rice with sliced almonds .
they wait for the moment of sunset on the day 's ramadan calendar and then each eats the customary date to start the meal . it does not take long for the ground-floor room to empty as they finish eating .
some move away quietly to pray and others go out to chat in the social room .
outside , most of the population is not even aware that the annual fasting month is happening . this is a part of germany , said one man , where the locals keep to themselves and consider themselves sociable if they greet a neighbor and say nothing else all day . bringing ramadan to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally ramadan is broken with dates , like the ones from this market in turkey the television coverage from turkey has invoked a feeling of yearning in some of the men to feel " at home , " to be among up to 15,000 guests breaking their fast in great tents in istanbul that are set up every year by rich benefactors and open to all comers , every evening of ramadan . at ramadan night prayers , the car park is full as 80 men and boys gather in a capacious loft that has been converted into the mosque 's main prayer room .
the leaders of the community , affiliated to the semi-official turkish religious body ditib , are proud of the center that opened in 1991 with the mosque , a shop , travel agency and social center on a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 43,000-square-feet -rrb- site with a big garden next to a wooded stream . mehmet demirbilek , a courier driver who was born near the black sea coast of turkey and came to germany in 1972 , said the official membership list of only 140 at the center belies its true influence in this area of germany . continuing the tradition the mosque is located in norderstedt , a town of schleswig-holstein state that is mainly a dormitory for the big nearby city of hamburg .
if the outlying areas of hamburg are included , an estimated 1,400 turks live in the area .
with arab and other muslims included , perhaps the number is 2,000 , and this mosque is open to all of them , he said . no one knows how many of these are observing the ramadan fast and ending the day with an iftar in the privacy of their own homes .
there is an uncomfortable silence when they are asked about westernized muslims who ignore the custom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramadan events in germany are smaller-scale " in islam , we are not supposed to judge others , " said 55-year-old nuri ahrens , an auto repairer who has lived in germany for the past 20 years . while most of the men at the iftar are single , or away from their wives , ahrens has left his wife at home for a women 's iftar . " she invites other women around to the place in the evening , " he added . " my heart has grown cold in this place " for those seeking the most sumptuous iftar meals , the big city of hamburg has restaurants that serve halal food approved by islam , but it is hard to get a seat at an iftar table : during ramadan , the restaurants are booked out months in advance . amid the companionship of the men 's nightly meal , some of the talk becomes a cry from the heart against the german society where they live .
one young man who has been a university student in the state capital kiel said he has resolved to move home to turkey . " if you were to take out my heart , you would find nothing but love there , " he said .

it 's a far cry from the bustle and excitement of that great iftar , the muslim evening meal that breaks the month of day-long fasting . two dozen men have gathered to eat a more modest iftar meal .
the group , mostly turkish-born but with a pakistani and bosnian among them , serve themselves meat dishes and fragrant rice with sliced almonds .
they wait for the moment of sunset on the day 's ramadan calendar and then each eats the customary date to start the meal . it does not take long for the ground-floor room to empty as they finish eating .
some move away quietly to pray and others go out to chat in the social room .

small publishers , though , have a tough time paying the high fees .
they have to be inventive . berlin-based verbrecher verlag has rented a stand measuring four square meters -lrb- 13 square feet -rrb- at the frankfurt book fair .
it 's not a lot of space , but still a luxury for the small publisher , which , along with its similarly sized colleagues , can hardly compete with german giants like suhrkamp or rowohlt . still , a greater number of small and mid-sized publishers are represented in frankfurt this year , fair director juergen boos said . frankfurt book fair organizers , however , do not offer special rates to mini publishing houses .
four-square-meter spaces cost around 700 euros -lrb- $ 887 -rrb- ; portable walls cost extra . for a tiny publisher like the cologne-based firwitz verlag - which has only published three books in all - such rates , plus costs for accommodations and food , are insurmountable . of the over 7,200 exhibitors presenting their books at the fair , the smaller publishers often have to work together .
forty-two of them pooled their resources , for instance , to rent a joint stand as part of the arbeitskreis kleinerer unabhängiger verlage -lrb- working group of small , independent publishers -rrb- , or akv .
at the stand , the publishers at least have one meter of wall space to present their books . idealism and a passion for books may be what motivates the small publishers , since sales are usually minimal .
firwitz verlag did not sell more books following its exhibition at last year 's book fair , it said . what the mini-publishers are hoping for is a big hit . " we 're all hoping for a bestseller like patrick süskind 's perfume , " verbrecher verlag 's jörg sundermeier told german news agency dpa . the small think big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to compete with " the big guys " ?
one of the " major " small players is munich-based a1 verlag .
in 1998 , it landed a bestseller with corinne hofmann 's autobiography " die weisse massai " -lrb- the white massai -rrb- , which was later adapted into a film .
it allowed the house to breathe more easily , publisher albert völkmann told ap .
" we could stop exploiting ourselves , " he said . a1 was founded 15 years ago .
now it employs five people and publishes around 10 books a year .
" our biggest problem , " said völkmann , " is getting space for our books in stores . "
he said a1 's books are often overshadowed by the bestsellers on bookstore shelves . in their struggle for recognition , the smaller publishers try to help each other out .
verbrecher verlag apparently recommended an author to another small publisher , berlin-based tropen verlag .
verbrecher publishers could not agree on payment with the author but felt he should be published , so they suggested him to tropen . tropen verlag has also had success with publishing translations of famous authors , such as american writer jonathan lethem . yet few of the tiny publishers catch that big fish .
many can only keep their heads above water through occasional grants .
often one-man-shows , they may take on freelance editing work or teaching to keep afloat . it 's their passion for books that keeps them going , many say . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair opens with focus on india , digital publishing the world 's biggest book fair opened in frankfurt on tuesday evening , shining a spotlight on the flourishing literary scene in guest country india and the rise of the internet as a challenge to the printed word .

small publishers , though , have a tough time paying the high fees .
they have to be inventive . berlin-based verbrecher verlag has rented a stand measuring four square meters -lrb- 13 square feet -rrb- at the frankfurt book fair .
it 's not a lot of space , but still a luxury for the small publisher , which , along with its similarly sized colleagues , can hardly compete with german giants like suhrkamp or rowohlt . still , a greater number of small and mid-sized publishers are represented in frankfurt this year , fair director juergen boos said . frankfurt book fair organizers , however , do not offer special rates to mini publishing houses .
four-square-meter spaces cost around 700 euros -lrb- $ 887 -rrb- ; portable walls cost extra . for a tiny publisher like the cologne-based firwitz verlag - which has only published three books in all - such rates , plus costs for accommodations and food , are insurmountable . of the over 7,200 exhibitors presenting their books at the fair , the smaller publishers often have to work together .
forty-two of them pooled their resources , for instance , to rent a joint stand as part of the arbeitskreis kleinerer unabhängiger verlage -lrb- working group of small , independent publishers -rrb- , or akv .
at the stand , the publishers at least have one meter of wall space to present their books . idealism and a passion for books may be what motivates the small publishers , since sales are usually minimal .
firwitz verlag did not sell more books following its exhibition at last year 's book fair , it said . what the mini-publishers are hoping for is a big hit . " we 're all hoping for a bestseller like patrick süskind 's perfume , " verbrecher verlag 's jörg sundermeier told german news agency dpa . the small think big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to compete with " the big guys " ?
one of the " major " small players is munich-based a1 verlag .
in 1998 , it landed a bestseller with corinne hofmann 's autobiography " die weisse massai " -lrb- the white massai -rrb- , which was later adapted into a film .
it allowed the house to breathe more easily , publisher albert völkmann told ap .
" we could stop exploiting ourselves , " he said . a1 was founded 15 years ago .
now it employs five people and publishes around 10 books a year .
" our biggest problem , " said völkmann , " is getting space for our books in stores . "
he said a1 's books are often overshadowed by the bestsellers on bookstore shelves . in their struggle for recognition , the smaller publishers try to help each other out .
verbrecher verlag apparently recommended an author to another small publisher , berlin-based tropen verlag .
verbrecher publishers could not agree on payment with the author but felt he should be published , so they suggested him to tropen . tropen verlag has also had success with publishing translations of famous authors , such as american writer jonathan lethem . yet few of the tiny publishers catch that big fish .
many can only keep their heads above water through occasional grants .
often one-man-shows , they may take on freelance editing work or teaching to keep afloat . it 's their passion for books that keeps them going , many say . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair opens with focus on india , digital publishing the world 's biggest book fair opened in frankfurt on tuesday evening , shining a spotlight on the flourishing literary scene in guest country india and the rise of the internet as a challenge to the printed word .
-lrb- 03.10.2006 -rrb- book publishers still unsure in internet age the impact of the web on the world of the novel remains clouded in uncertainty , industry players at the frankfurt book fair said wednesday as they began discussing ways to weather the change .

less than half of what 's exhibited are books in the classic form - printed on paper and bound .
much on show consists of bits and bytes . the global digital boom poses all sorts of challenges for the traditional book market .
audio books , films , toys , writing utensils and electronic media are taking center-stage more and more at the frankfurt book fair .
from picture books that speak to bilingual learning software , digital media for children is regularly on show in frankfurt . just a few years ago , electronic publishing had its own place in a separate exhibition hall at the book fair - far removed from the classic books printed on paper .
book exhibitors used to eye the products skeptically - but not anymore . digital books now find their place among those on paper .
thirty percent of the products on show this year in frankfurt are digital works .
digital future some publishers are even completely focusing their efforts on the so-called internet generation . " the future is in mobile learning , " said armin hopp , who established his munich-based language media company called " digital publishing " 10 years ago .
hopp said his firm had , since then , developed into europe 's leading producer of language learning software .
the different materials it produces , including software , can be saved on usb sticks and other forms of portable digital storage devices .
the company also provides online tutors , decreasing the need for language textbooks . electronic libraries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are books traditionally printed on paper being squeezed out of the market ?
another huge challenge facing the book market is publishing on the internet .
frightened by the notion that search engine google wants to allow free access to entire libraries on the web , german publishers have started a counter-offensive .
the german publishers and booksellers association aims to launch its own online platform in early 2007 .
from bestselling novels to non-fiction , everything is to be digitized and offered to readers online .
they will be able to read excerpts or entire books , for which , however , they will have to pay . science databanks then there are specialized solutions .
springer science , for instance , presented the largest scientific e-book program to date , in frankfurt .
the publisher 's customers include libraries , which can buy works online at reasonable prices . despite the company 's product line , olaf ernst , head of the e-book program at springer science , disagreed with the widespread notion that online books would cause fewer printed books to be sold . " a printed book is still used differently than an electronic one , " said .
" the electronic area works kind of like a databank , in which you search and find something .
once you find it , you then go to the printed book , because you can work with it better , " he said . ernst 's clientele in particular was unlikely to make the switch , he said .

" the electronic area works kind of like a databank , in which you search and find something .
once you find it , you then go to the printed book , because you can work with it better , " he said . ernst 's clientele in particular was unlikely to make the switch , he said .

less than half of what 's exhibited are books in the classic form - printed on paper and bound .
much on show consists of bits and bytes . the global digital boom poses all sorts of challenges for the traditional book market .
audio books , films , toys , writing utensils and electronic media are taking center-stage more and more at the frankfurt book fair .
from picture books that speak to bilingual learning software , digital media for children is regularly on show in frankfurt . just a few years ago , electronic publishing had its own place in a separate exhibition hall at the book fair - far removed from the classic books printed on paper .
book exhibitors used to eye the products skeptically - but not anymore . digital books now find their place among those on paper .
thirty percent of the products on show this year in frankfurt are digital works .
digital future some publishers are even completely focusing their efforts on the so-called internet generation . " the future is in mobile learning , " said armin hopp , who established his munich-based language media company called " digital publishing " 10 years ago .
hopp said his firm had , since then , developed into europe 's leading producer of language learning software .
the different materials it produces , including software , can be saved on usb sticks and other forms of portable digital storage devices .
the company also provides online tutors , decreasing the need for language textbooks . electronic libraries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are books traditionally printed on paper being squeezed out of the market ?
another huge challenge facing the book market is publishing on the internet .
frightened by the notion that search engine google wants to allow free access to entire libraries on the web , german publishers have started a counter-offensive .
the german publishers and booksellers association aims to launch its own online platform in early 2007 .
from bestselling novels to non-fiction , everything is to be digitized and offered to readers online .
they will be able to read excerpts or entire books , for which , however , they will have to pay . science databanks then there are specialized solutions .
springer science , for instance , presented the largest scientific e-book program to date , in frankfurt .

small publishers , though , have a tough time paying the high fees .
they have to be inventive . berlin-based verbrecher verlag has rented a stand measuring four square meters -lrb- 13 square feet -rrb- at the frankfurt book fair .
it 's not a lot of space , but still a luxury for the small publisher , which , along with its similarly sized colleagues , can hardly compete with german giants like suhrkamp or rowohlt . still , a greater number of small and mid-sized publishers are represented in frankfurt this year , fair director juergen boos said . frankfurt book fair organizers , however , do not offer special rates to mini publishing houses .
four-square-meter spaces cost around 700 euros -lrb- $ 887 -rrb- ; portable walls cost extra . for a tiny publisher like the cologne-based firwitz verlag - which has only published three books in all - such rates , plus costs for accommodations and food , are insurmountable . of the over 7,200 exhibitors presenting their books at the fair , the smaller publishers often have to work together .
forty-two of them pooled their resources , for instance , to rent a joint stand as part of the arbeitskreis kleinerer unabhängiger verlage -lrb- working group of small , independent publishers -rrb- , or akv .
at the stand , the publishers at least have one meter of wall space to present their books . idealism and a passion for books may be what motivates the small publishers , since sales are usually minimal .
firwitz verlag did not sell more books following its exhibition at last year 's book fair , it said . what the mini-publishers are hoping for is a big hit . " we 're all hoping for a bestseller like patrick süskind 's perfume , " verbrecher verlag 's jörg sundermeier told german news agency dpa . the small think big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to compete with " the big guys " ?
one of the " major " small players is munich-based a1 verlag .
in 1998 , it landed a bestseller with corinne hofmann 's autobiography " die weisse massai " -lrb- the white massai -rrb- , which was later adapted into a film .
it allowed the house to breathe more easily , publisher albert völkmann told ap .
" we could stop exploiting ourselves , " he said . a1 was founded 15 years ago .
now it employs five people and publishes around 10 books a year .
" our biggest problem , " said völkmann , " is getting space for our books in stores . "
he said a1 's books are often overshadowed by the bestsellers on bookstore shelves . in their struggle for recognition , the smaller publishers try to help each other out .
verbrecher verlag apparently recommended an author to another small publisher , berlin-based tropen verlag .
verbrecher publishers could not agree on payment with the author but felt he should be published , so they suggested him to tropen . tropen verlag has also had success with publishing translations of famous authors , such as american writer jonathan lethem . yet few of the tiny publishers catch that big fish .

small publishers , though , have a tough time paying the high fees .
they have to be inventive . berlin-based verbrecher verlag has rented a stand measuring four square meters -lrb- 13 square feet -rrb- at the frankfurt book fair .
it 's not a lot of space , but still a luxury for the small publisher , which , along with its similarly sized colleagues , can hardly compete with german giants like suhrkamp or rowohlt . still , a greater number of small and mid-sized publishers are represented in frankfurt this year , fair director juergen boos said . frankfurt book fair organizers , however , do not offer special rates to mini publishing houses .
four-square-meter spaces cost around 700 euros -lrb- $ 887 -rrb- ; portable walls cost extra . for a tiny publisher like the cologne-based firwitz verlag - which has only published three books in all - such rates , plus costs for accommodations and food , are insurmountable . of the over 7,200 exhibitors presenting their books at the fair , the smaller publishers often have to work together .
forty-two of them pooled their resources , for instance , to rent a joint stand as part of the arbeitskreis kleinerer unabhängiger verlage -lrb- working group of small , independent publishers -rrb- , or akv .
at the stand , the publishers at least have one meter of wall space to present their books . idealism and a passion for books may be what motivates the small publishers , since sales are usually minimal .
firwitz verlag did not sell more books following its exhibition at last year 's book fair , it said . what the mini-publishers are hoping for is a big hit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 08.10.2006 breaking the ramadan fast in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparing for iftar ramadan might not be as present in germany as in predominantly muslim countries , but throughout the country and even in the smallest towns , people gather together to break the fast . at a mosque in germany 's northern-most state of schleswig-holstein , the men 's eyes sparkle for a moment as they watch pictures on turkish television of thousands of people ending the ramadan fast for the day in istanbul .
it 's a far cry from the bustle and excitement of that great iftar , the muslim evening meal that breaks the month of day-long fasting . two dozen men have gathered to eat a more modest iftar meal .
the group , mostly turkish-born but with a pakistani and bosnian among them , serve themselves meat dishes and fragrant rice with sliced almonds .
they wait for the moment of sunset on the day 's ramadan calendar and then each eats the customary date to start the meal . it does not take long for the ground-floor room to empty as they finish eating .
some move away quietly to pray and others go out to chat in the social room .
outside , most of the population is not even aware that the annual fasting month is happening . this is a part of germany , said one man , where the locals keep to themselves and consider themselves sociable if they greet a neighbor and say nothing else all day . bringing ramadan to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally ramadan is broken with dates , like the ones from this market in turkey the television coverage from turkey has invoked a feeling of yearning in some of the men to feel " at home , " to be among up to 15,000 guests breaking their fast in great tents in istanbul that are set up every year by rich benefactors and open to all comers , every evening of ramadan . at ramadan night prayers , the car park is full as 80 men and boys gather in a capacious loft that has been converted into the mosque 's main prayer room .
the leaders of the community , affiliated to the semi-official turkish religious body ditib , are proud of the center that opened in 1991 with the mosque , a shop , travel agency and social center on a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 43,000-square-feet -rrb- site with a big garden next to a wooded stream . mehmet demirbilek , a courier driver who was born near the black sea coast of turkey and came to germany in 1972 , said the official membership list of only 140 at the center belies its true influence in this area of germany . continuing the tradition the mosque is located in norderstedt , a town of schleswig-holstein state that is mainly a dormitory for the big nearby city of hamburg .
if the outlying areas of hamburg are included , an estimated 1,400 turks live in the area .
with arab and other muslims included , perhaps the number is 2,000 , and this mosque is open to all of them , he said . no one knows how many of these are observing the ramadan fast and ending the day with an iftar in the privacy of their own homes .
there is an uncomfortable silence when they are asked about westernized muslims who ignore the custom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramadan events in germany are smaller-scale " in islam , we are not supposed to judge others , " said 55-year-old nuri ahrens , an auto repairer who has lived in germany for the past 20 years . while most of the men at the iftar are single , or away from their wives , ahrens has left his wife at home for a women 's iftar . " she invites other women around to the place in the evening , " he added . " my heart has grown cold in this place " for those seeking the most sumptuous iftar meals , the big city of hamburg has restaurants that serve halal food approved by islam , but it is hard to get a seat at an iftar table : during ramadan , the restaurants are booked out months in advance . amid the companionship of the men 's nightly meal , some of the talk becomes a cry from the heart against the german society where they live .
one young man who has been a university student in the state capital kiel said he has resolved to move home to turkey . " if you were to take out my heart , you would find nothing but love there , " he said .
" i have no hate .
but my heart has grown cold in this place . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's muslim of choice he 's the man eu officials and journalists alike seek out when islam and western europe do n't see eye-to-eye .

-lrb- 15.02.2006 -rrb- another german state bans headscarf for teachers germany 's most populous state , north-rhine westphalia , joins seven other states in forbidding teachers in public schools from wearing the muslim headscarf .

the stereotypical smoky french bistro could soon be an image of the past if a parliamentary recommendation to ban smoking in public places is adopted in france . the government is expected to make a decision on the proposal by mid-october .
if a ban is announced , france would join other european countries , with similar bans including ireland , britain , spain and italy . french government 's indecision over smoking ban polls regularly show that a majority of the french support a ban on smoking in public places . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking and passive smoking kills more than 70,000 people in france each year however , weakened by a battle with labor unions and students over a controversial youth employment law , the french government backed down in april from a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants to avoid a clash with france 's die-hard smokers and the cigarette industry . according to government figures , some 35 percent of the french population use tobacco , but the statistics also show that smoking kills 66,000 smokers in france each year while a further 5,000 people die from passive smoking . if the ban is agreed to , french smokers will have to make drastic adjustments as the new rule recommends smoking be completely prohibited unless an establishment can provide hermetically-sealed " fumoirs , " which serving staff would not enter . the government is currently ignoring the outcry from the bar and tobacco lobby , which is warning of the dire financial consequences if the ban comes into effect . panel recommends total ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banning smoking has been advised by the parliamentary panel after five months of consultations with doctors , tobacconists and trade unions , the 30-member parliamentary panel decided in favor of a blanket ban . the report also advised the government to resort to a decree to enact the ban rather than a law , which it said could then become an unwanted campaign issue in the run-up to the 2007 presidential elections . moves to prohibit public smoking in france reflect the changing mood across much of europe where several countries have introduced similar measures , including italy , sweden , ukraine , britain and spain . germany , one of the last bastions of smoking in western europe , meanwhile is slowly warming up to a ban in public places .
but a proposed bill expected to enter parliament in the fall has already been watered down because of pressure from the tobacco lobby . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government accused of bowing to tobacco lobby after announcing it will drop plans to enforce a full ban on smoking in restaurants , germany 's ruling coalition came under fire from the greens who accused the government of bowing to pressure from the tobacco lobby .

small publishers , though , have a tough time paying the high fees .
they have to be inventive . berlin-based verbrecher verlag has rented a stand measuring four square meters -lrb- 13 square feet -rrb- at the frankfurt book fair .
it 's not a lot of space , but still a luxury for the small publisher , which , along with its similarly sized colleagues , can hardly compete with german giants like suhrkamp or rowohlt . still , a greater number of small and mid-sized publishers are represented in frankfurt this year , fair director juergen boos said . frankfurt book fair organizers , however , do not offer special rates to mini publishing houses .
four-square-meter spaces cost around 700 euros -lrb- $ 887 -rrb- ; portable walls cost extra . for a tiny publisher like the cologne-based firwitz verlag - which has only published three books in all - such rates , plus costs for accommodations and food , are insurmountable . of the over 7,200 exhibitors presenting their books at the fair , the smaller publishers often have to work together .
forty-two of them pooled their resources , for instance , to rent a joint stand as part of the arbeitskreis kleinerer unabhängiger verlage -lrb- working group of small , independent publishers -rrb- , or akv .
at the stand , the publishers at least have one meter of wall space to present their books . idealism and a passion for books may be what motivates the small publishers , since sales are usually minimal .
firwitz verlag did not sell more books following its exhibition at last year 's book fair , it said . what the mini-publishers are hoping for is a big hit . " we 're all hoping for a bestseller like patrick süskind 's perfume , " verbrecher verlag 's jörg sundermeier told german news agency dpa . the small think big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to compete with " the big guys " ?
one of the " major " small players is munich-based a1 verlag .
in 1998 , it landed a bestseller with corinne hofmann 's autobiography " die weisse massai " -lrb- the white massai -rrb- , which was later adapted into a film .
it allowed the house to breathe more easily , publisher albert völkmann told ap .
" we could stop exploiting ourselves , " he said . a1 was founded 15 years ago .
now it employs five people and publishes around 10 books a year .
" our biggest problem , " said völkmann , " is getting space for our books in stores . "
he said a1 's books are often overshadowed by the bestsellers on bookstore shelves . in their struggle for recognition , the smaller publishers try to help each other out .
verbrecher verlag apparently recommended an author to another small publisher , berlin-based tropen verlag .
verbrecher publishers could not agree on payment with the author but felt he should be published , so they suggested him to tropen . tropen verlag has also had success with publishing translations of famous authors , such as american writer jonathan lethem . yet few of the tiny publishers catch that big fish .
many can only keep their heads above water through occasional grants .
often one-man-shows , they may take on freelance editing work or teaching to keep afloat . it 's their passion for books that keeps them going , many say . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair opens with focus on india , digital publishing the world 's biggest book fair opened in frankfurt on tuesday evening , shining a spotlight on the flourishing literary scene in guest country india and the rise of the internet as a challenge to the printed word .

" i was provoked , but that should still not happen and there can be no excuses , " podolski said . khizanishvili joined podolski in the dressing room 14 minutes later when he was shown a second yellow card for a tackle from behind on mike hanke . goals in each half from bastian schweinsteiger and germany captain michael ballack gave coach joachim löw his fourth successive victory since succeeding jürgen klinsmann after the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi had more to celebrate in the last match against ireland ballack set schweinsteiger up to strike a superb distance shot into the top of the net in the 24th minute to put germany in front . the bayern player then returned the favor by providing the pass to ballack who left-footed the second in the 67th minute in a spell of german pressure after both teams had been reduced to 10 men . still things to talk about in german locker room " it was an entertaining game and we made some mistakes but we had four players playing for the first time and a lot of young players in the side , " löw said .
" we played with a lot of heart , but we will have to talk about some things with the team . " löw said the red card for podolski was " a logical consequence " of the kick on khizanishvili . " he is a young player but this is something we will have to talk about internally , " löw said .
" it 's the sort of thing that should not happen . " bildunterschrift : clemens fritz , jan schlaudraff and piotr trochowski , from left new hands get first caps werder bremen defender clemens fritz and hamburg midfielder piotr trochowski were two new caps in an inexperienced-looking germany team lacking several established players . aachen striker jan schlaudraff and wolfsburg defender alexander madlung of wolfsburg also earned first caps when they came on during the second half for hanke and manuel friedrich respectively . georgia could thank goergi lomaia for keeping his side in the match , but the visitors also came close to scoring in the first half after a hesitant start by the germans .

small publishers , though , have a tough time paying the high fees .
they have to be inventive . berlin-based verbrecher verlag has rented a stand measuring four square meters -lrb- 13 square feet -rrb- at the frankfurt book fair .
it 's not a lot of space , but still a luxury for the small publisher , which , along with its similarly sized colleagues , can hardly compete with german giants like suhrkamp or rowohlt . still , a greater number of small and mid-sized publishers are represented in frankfurt this year , fair director juergen boos said . frankfurt book fair organizers , however , do not offer special rates to mini publishing houses .
four-square-meter spaces cost around 700 euros -lrb- $ 887 -rrb- ; portable walls cost extra . for a tiny publisher like the cologne-based firwitz verlag - which has only published three books in all - such rates , plus costs for accommodations and food , are insurmountable . of the over 7,200 exhibitors presenting their books at the fair , the smaller publishers often have to work together .
forty-two of them pooled their resources , for instance , to rent a joint stand as part of the arbeitskreis kleinerer unabhängiger verlage -lrb- working group of small , independent publishers -rrb- , or akv .
at the stand , the publishers at least have one meter of wall space to present their books . idealism and a passion for books may be what motivates the small publishers , since sales are usually minimal .
firwitz verlag did not sell more books following its exhibition at last year 's book fair , it said . what the mini-publishers are hoping for is a big hit . " we 're all hoping for a bestseller like patrick süskind 's perfume , " verbrecher verlag 's jörg sundermeier told german news agency dpa . the small think big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to compete with " the big guys " ?
one of the " major " small players is munich-based a1 verlag .
in 1998 , it landed a bestseller with corinne hofmann 's autobiography " die weisse massai " -lrb- the white massai -rrb- , which was later adapted into a film .
it allowed the house to breathe more easily , publisher albert völkmann told ap .
" we could stop exploiting ourselves , " he said . a1 was founded 15 years ago .
now it employs five people and publishes around 10 books a year .
" our biggest problem , " said völkmann , " is getting space for our books in stores . "
he said a1 's books are often overshadowed by the bestsellers on bookstore shelves . in their struggle for recognition , the smaller publishers try to help each other out .
verbrecher verlag apparently recommended an author to another small publisher , berlin-based tropen verlag .
verbrecher publishers could not agree on payment with the author but felt he should be published , so they suggested him to tropen . tropen verlag has also had success with publishing translations of famous authors , such as american writer jonathan lethem . yet few of the tiny publishers catch that big fish .
many can only keep their heads above water through occasional grants .
often one-man-shows , they may take on freelance editing work or teaching to keep afloat . it 's their passion for books that keeps them going , many say . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair opens with focus on india , digital publishing the world 's biggest book fair opened in frankfurt on tuesday evening , shining a spotlight on the flourishing literary scene in guest country india and the rise of the internet as a challenge to the printed word .

forty-two of them pooled their resources , for instance , to rent a joint stand as part of the arbeitskreis kleinerer unabhängiger verlage -lrb- working group of small , independent publishers -rrb- , or akv .
at the stand , the publishers at least have one meter of wall space to present their books . idealism and a passion for books may be what motivates the small publishers , since sales are usually minimal .

it allowed the house to breathe more easily , publisher albert völkmann told ap .
" we could stop exploiting ourselves , " he said . a1 was founded 15 years ago .
now it employs five people and publishes around 10 books a year .
" our biggest problem , " said völkmann , " is getting space for our books in stores . "
he said a1 's books are often overshadowed by the bestsellers on bookstore shelves . in their struggle for recognition , the smaller publishers try to help each other out .
verbrecher verlag apparently recommended an author to another small publisher , berlin-based tropen verlag .
verbrecher publishers could not agree on payment with the author but felt he should be published , so they suggested him to tropen . tropen verlag has also had success with publishing translations of famous authors , such as american writer jonathan lethem . yet few of the tiny publishers catch that big fish .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 08.10.2006 breaking the ramadan fast in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparing for iftar ramadan might not be as present in germany as in predominantly muslim countries , but throughout the country and even in the smallest towns , people gather together to break the fast . at a mosque in germany 's northern-most state of schleswig-holstein , the men 's eyes sparkle for a moment as they watch pictures on turkish television of thousands of people ending the ramadan fast for the day in istanbul .
it 's a far cry from the bustle and excitement of that great iftar , the muslim evening meal that breaks the month of day-long fasting . two dozen men have gathered to eat a more modest iftar meal .
the group , mostly turkish-born but with a pakistani and bosnian among them , serve themselves meat dishes and fragrant rice with sliced almonds .
they wait for the moment of sunset on the day 's ramadan calendar and then each eats the customary date to start the meal . it does not take long for the ground-floor room to empty as they finish eating .
some move away quietly to pray and others go out to chat in the social room .
outside , most of the population is not even aware that the annual fasting month is happening . this is a part of germany , said one man , where the locals keep to themselves and consider themselves sociable if they greet a neighbor and say nothing else all day . bringing ramadan to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally ramadan is broken with dates , like the ones from this market in turkey the television coverage from turkey has invoked a feeling of yearning in some of the men to feel " at home , " to be among up to 15,000 guests breaking their fast in great tents in istanbul that are set up every year by rich benefactors and open to all comers , every evening of ramadan . at ramadan night prayers , the car park is full as 80 men and boys gather in a capacious loft that has been converted into the mosque 's main prayer room .
the leaders of the community , affiliated to the semi-official turkish religious body ditib , are proud of the center that opened in 1991 with the mosque , a shop , travel agency and social center on a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 43,000-square-feet -rrb- site with a big garden next to a wooded stream . mehmet demirbilek , a courier driver who was born near the black sea coast of turkey and came to germany in 1972 , said the official membership list of only 140 at the center belies its true influence in this area of germany . continuing the tradition the mosque is located in norderstedt , a town of schleswig-holstein state that is mainly a dormitory for the big nearby city of hamburg .
if the outlying areas of hamburg are included , an estimated 1,400 turks live in the area .
with arab and other muslims included , perhaps the number is 2,000 , and this mosque is open to all of them , he said . no one knows how many of these are observing the ramadan fast and ending the day with an iftar in the privacy of their own homes .
there is an uncomfortable silence when they are asked about westernized muslims who ignore the custom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramadan events in germany are smaller-scale " in islam , we are not supposed to judge others , " said 55-year-old nuri ahrens , an auto repairer who has lived in germany for the past 20 years . while most of the men at the iftar are single , or away from their wives , ahrens has left his wife at home for a women 's iftar . " she invites other women around to the place in the evening , " he added . " my heart has grown cold in this place " for those seeking the most sumptuous iftar meals , the big city of hamburg has restaurants that serve halal food approved by islam , but it is hard to get a seat at an iftar table : during ramadan , the restaurants are booked out months in advance . amid the companionship of the men 's nightly meal , some of the talk becomes a cry from the heart against the german society where they live .
one young man who has been a university student in the state capital kiel said he has resolved to move home to turkey . " if you were to take out my heart , you would find nothing but love there , " he said .
" i have no hate .
but my heart has grown cold in this place . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's muslim of choice he 's the man eu officials and journalists alike seek out when islam and western europe do n't see eye-to-eye .

it 's a far cry from the bustle and excitement of that great iftar , the muslim evening meal that breaks the month of day-long fasting . two dozen men have gathered to eat a more modest iftar meal .
the group , mostly turkish-born but with a pakistani and bosnian among them , serve themselves meat dishes and fragrant rice with sliced almonds .
they wait for the moment of sunset on the day 's ramadan calendar and then each eats the customary date to start the meal . it does not take long for the ground-floor room to empty as they finish eating .
some move away quietly to pray and others go out to chat in the social room .
outside , most of the population is not even aware that the annual fasting month is happening . this is a part of germany , said one man , where the locals keep to themselves and consider themselves sociable if they greet a neighbor and say nothing else all day . bringing ramadan to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally ramadan is broken with dates , like the ones from this market in turkey the television coverage from turkey has invoked a feeling of yearning in some of the men to feel " at home , " to be among up to 15,000 guests breaking their fast in great tents in istanbul that are set up every year by rich benefactors and open to all comers , every evening of ramadan . at ramadan night prayers , the car park is full as 80 men and boys gather in a capacious loft that has been converted into the mosque 's main prayer room .
the leaders of the community , affiliated to the semi-official turkish religious body ditib , are proud of the center that opened in 1991 with the mosque , a shop , travel agency and social center on a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 43,000-square-feet -rrb- site with a big garden next to a wooded stream . mehmet demirbilek , a courier driver who was born near the black sea coast of turkey and came to germany in 1972 , said the official membership list of only 140 at the center belies its true influence in this area of germany . continuing the tradition the mosque is located in norderstedt , a town of schleswig-holstein state that is mainly a dormitory for the big nearby city of hamburg .
if the outlying areas of hamburg are included , an estimated 1,400 turks live in the area .
with arab and other muslims included , perhaps the number is 2,000 , and this mosque is open to all of them , he said . no one knows how many of these are observing the ramadan fast and ending the day with an iftar in the privacy of their own homes .
there is an uncomfortable silence when they are asked about westernized muslims who ignore the custom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramadan events in germany are smaller-scale " in islam , we are not supposed to judge others , " said 55-year-old nuri ahrens , an auto repairer who has lived in germany for the past 20 years . while most of the men at the iftar are single , or away from their wives , ahrens has left his wife at home for a women 's iftar . " she invites other women around to the place in the evening , " he added . " my heart has grown cold in this place " for those seeking the most sumptuous iftar meals , the big city of hamburg has restaurants that serve halal food approved by islam , but it is hard to get a seat at an iftar table : during ramadan , the restaurants are booked out months in advance . amid the companionship of the men 's nightly meal , some of the talk becomes a cry from the heart against the german society where they live .
one young man who has been a university student in the state capital kiel said he has resolved to move home to turkey . " if you were to take out my heart , you would find nothing but love there , " he said .

it 's a far cry from the bustle and excitement of that great iftar , the muslim evening meal that breaks the month of day-long fasting . two dozen men have gathered to eat a more modest iftar meal .
the group , mostly turkish-born but with a pakistani and bosnian among them , serve themselves meat dishes and fragrant rice with sliced almonds .
they wait for the moment of sunset on the day 's ramadan calendar and then each eats the customary date to start the meal . it does not take long for the ground-floor room to empty as they finish eating .

small publishers , though , have a tough time paying the high fees .
they have to be inventive . berlin-based verbrecher verlag has rented a stand measuring four square meters -lrb- 13 square feet -rrb- at the frankfurt book fair .
it 's not a lot of space , but still a luxury for the small publisher , which , along with its similarly sized colleagues , can hardly compete with german giants like suhrkamp or rowohlt . still , a greater number of small and mid-sized publishers are represented in frankfurt this year , fair director juergen boos said . frankfurt book fair organizers , however , do not offer special rates to mini publishing houses .
four-square-meter spaces cost around 700 euros -lrb- $ 887 -rrb- ; portable walls cost extra . for a tiny publisher like the cologne-based firwitz verlag - which has only published three books in all - such rates , plus costs for accommodations and food , are insurmountable . of the over 7,200 exhibitors presenting their books at the fair , the smaller publishers often have to work together .
forty-two of them pooled their resources , for instance , to rent a joint stand as part of the arbeitskreis kleinerer unabhängiger verlage -lrb- working group of small , independent publishers -rrb- , or akv .
at the stand , the publishers at least have one meter of wall space to present their books . idealism and a passion for books may be what motivates the small publishers , since sales are usually minimal .

it allowed the house to breathe more easily , publisher albert völkmann told ap .
" we could stop exploiting ourselves , " he said . a1 was founded 15 years ago .
now it employs five people and publishes around 10 books a year .
" our biggest problem , " said völkmann , " is getting space for our books in stores . "
he said a1 's books are often overshadowed by the bestsellers on bookstore shelves . in their struggle for recognition , the smaller publishers try to help each other out .
verbrecher verlag apparently recommended an author to another small publisher , berlin-based tropen verlag .
verbrecher publishers could not agree on payment with the author but felt he should be published , so they suggested him to tropen . tropen verlag has also had success with publishing translations of famous authors , such as american writer jonathan lethem . yet few of the tiny publishers catch that big fish .

small publishers , though , have a tough time paying the high fees .
they have to be inventive . berlin-based verbrecher verlag has rented a stand measuring four square meters -lrb- 13 square feet -rrb- at the frankfurt book fair .
it 's not a lot of space , but still a luxury for the small publisher , which , along with its similarly sized colleagues , can hardly compete with german giants like suhrkamp or rowohlt . still , a greater number of small and mid-sized publishers are represented in frankfurt this year , fair director juergen boos said . frankfurt book fair organizers , however , do not offer special rates to mini publishing houses .
four-square-meter spaces cost around 700 euros -lrb- $ 887 -rrb- ; portable walls cost extra . for a tiny publisher like the cologne-based firwitz verlag - which has only published three books in all - such rates , plus costs for accommodations and food , are insurmountable . of the over 7,200 exhibitors presenting their books at the fair , the smaller publishers often have to work together .
forty-two of them pooled their resources , for instance , to rent a joint stand as part of the arbeitskreis kleinerer unabhängiger verlage -lrb- working group of small , independent publishers -rrb- , or akv .
at the stand , the publishers at least have one meter of wall space to present their books . idealism and a passion for books may be what motivates the small publishers , since sales are usually minimal .
firwitz verlag did not sell more books following its exhibition at last year 's book fair , it said . what the mini-publishers are hoping for is a big hit . " we 're all hoping for a bestseller like patrick süskind 's perfume , " verbrecher verlag 's jörg sundermeier told german news agency dpa . the small think big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to compete with " the big guys " ?
one of the " major " small players is munich-based a1 verlag .
in 1998 , it landed a bestseller with corinne hofmann 's autobiography " die weisse massai " -lrb- the white massai -rrb- , which was later adapted into a film .
it allowed the house to breathe more easily , publisher albert völkmann told ap .
" we could stop exploiting ourselves , " he said . a1 was founded 15 years ago .
now it employs five people and publishes around 10 books a year .
" our biggest problem , " said völkmann , " is getting space for our books in stores . "
he said a1 's books are often overshadowed by the bestsellers on bookstore shelves . in their struggle for recognition , the smaller publishers try to help each other out .
verbrecher verlag apparently recommended an author to another small publisher , berlin-based tropen verlag .
verbrecher publishers could not agree on payment with the author but felt he should be published , so they suggested him to tropen . tropen verlag has also had success with publishing translations of famous authors , such as american writer jonathan lethem . yet few of the tiny publishers catch that big fish .
many can only keep their heads above water through occasional grants .
often one-man-shows , they may take on freelance editing work or teaching to keep afloat . it 's their passion for books that keeps them going , many say . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair opens with focus on india , digital publishing the world 's biggest book fair opened in frankfurt on tuesday evening , shining a spotlight on the flourishing literary scene in guest country india and the rise of the internet as a challenge to the printed word .

it 's a far cry from the bustle and excitement of that great iftar , the muslim evening meal that breaks the month of day-long fasting . two dozen men have gathered to eat a more modest iftar meal .
the group , mostly turkish-born but with a pakistani and bosnian among them , serve themselves meat dishes and fragrant rice with sliced almonds .
they wait for the moment of sunset on the day 's ramadan calendar and then each eats the customary date to start the meal . it does not take long for the ground-floor room to empty as they finish eating .
some move away quietly to pray and others go out to chat in the social room .

with arab and other muslims included , perhaps the number is 2,000 , and this mosque is open to all of them , he said . no one knows how many of these are observing the ramadan fast and ending the day with an iftar in the privacy of their own homes .
there is an uncomfortable silence when they are asked about westernized muslims who ignore the custom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramadan events in germany are smaller-scale " in islam , we are not supposed to judge others , " said 55-year-old nuri ahrens , an auto repairer who has lived in germany for the past 20 years . while most of the men at the iftar are single , or away from their wives , ahrens has left his wife at home for a women 's iftar . " she invites other women around to the place in the evening , " he added . " my heart has grown cold in this place " for those seeking the most sumptuous iftar meals , the big city of hamburg has restaurants that serve halal food approved by islam , but it is hard to get a seat at an iftar table : during ramadan , the restaurants are booked out months in advance . amid the companionship of the men 's nightly meal , some of the talk becomes a cry from the heart against the german society where they live .
one young man who has been a university student in the state capital kiel said he has resolved to move home to turkey . " if you were to take out my heart , you would find nothing but love there , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair 2006 hollywood deals inked at frankfurt 's book fair " bombay is a city of extremes " small publishers squeeze together at frankfurt book fair india 's regional literature a tough sell at frankfurt book fair -pipe- 08.10.2006 bits and bytes at the frankfurt book fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : digital media has a ways to go before it takes the place of works in print the frankfurt book fair has turned into more of a media market , over the years .
less than half of what 's exhibited are books in the classic form - printed on paper and bound .
much on show consists of bits and bytes . the global digital boom poses all sorts of challenges for the traditional book market .
audio books , films , toys , writing utensils and electronic media are taking center-stage more and more at the frankfurt book fair .
from picture books that speak to bilingual learning software , digital media for children is regularly on show in frankfurt . just a few years ago , electronic publishing had its own place in a separate exhibition hall at the book fair - far removed from the classic books printed on paper .
book exhibitors used to eye the products skeptically - but not anymore . digital books now find their place among those on paper .
thirty percent of the products on show this year in frankfurt are digital works .
digital future some publishers are even completely focusing their efforts on the so-called internet generation . " the future is in mobile learning , " said armin hopp , who established his munich-based language media company called " digital publishing " 10 years ago .
hopp said his firm had , since then , developed into europe 's leading producer of language learning software .
the different materials it produces , including software , can be saved on usb sticks and other forms of portable digital storage devices .
the company also provides online tutors , decreasing the need for language textbooks . electronic libraries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are books traditionally printed on paper being squeezed out of the market ?
another huge challenge facing the book market is publishing on the internet .
frightened by the notion that search engine google wants to allow free access to entire libraries on the web , german publishers have started a counter-offensive .
the german publishers and booksellers association aims to launch its own online platform in early 2007 .
from bestselling novels to non-fiction , everything is to be digitized and offered to readers online .
they will be able to read excerpts or entire books , for which , however , they will have to pay . science databanks then there are specialized solutions .
springer science , for instance , presented the largest scientific e-book program to date , in frankfurt .
the publisher 's customers include libraries , which can buy works online at reasonable prices . despite the company 's product line , olaf ernst , head of the e-book program at springer science , disagreed with the widespread notion that online books would cause fewer printed books to be sold . " a printed book is still used differently than an electronic one , " said .
" the electronic area works kind of like a databank , in which you search and find something .
once you find it , you then go to the printed book , because you can work with it better , " he said . ernst 's clientele in particular was unlikely to make the switch , he said .
scientists like to leaf through books , and it 's still easier to do that with printed literature , he said . gabriela schaaf -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair opens with focus on india , digital publishing the world 's biggest book fair opened in frankfurt on tuesday evening , shining a spotlight on the flourishing literary scene in guest country india and the rise of the internet as a challenge to the printed word .

less than half of what 's exhibited are books in the classic form - printed on paper and bound .
much on show consists of bits and bytes . the global digital boom poses all sorts of challenges for the traditional book market .
audio books , films , toys , writing utensils and electronic media are taking center-stage more and more at the frankfurt book fair .
from picture books that speak to bilingual learning software , digital media for children is regularly on show in frankfurt . just a few years ago , electronic publishing had its own place in a separate exhibition hall at the book fair - far removed from the classic books printed on paper .
book exhibitors used to eye the products skeptically - but not anymore . digital books now find their place among those on paper .
thirty percent of the products on show this year in frankfurt are digital works .
digital future some publishers are even completely focusing their efforts on the so-called internet generation . " the future is in mobile learning , " said armin hopp , who established his munich-based language media company called " digital publishing " 10 years ago .
hopp said his firm had , since then , developed into europe 's leading producer of language learning software .
the different materials it produces , including software , can be saved on usb sticks and other forms of portable digital storage devices .
the company also provides online tutors , decreasing the need for language textbooks . electronic libraries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are books traditionally printed on paper being squeezed out of the market ?
another huge challenge facing the book market is publishing on the internet .
frightened by the notion that search engine google wants to allow free access to entire libraries on the web , german publishers have started a counter-offensive .
the german publishers and booksellers association aims to launch its own online platform in early 2007 .
from bestselling novels to non-fiction , everything is to be digitized and offered to readers online .
they will be able to read excerpts or entire books , for which , however , they will have to pay . science databanks then there are specialized solutions .
springer science , for instance , presented the largest scientific e-book program to date , in frankfurt .
the publisher 's customers include libraries , which can buy works online at reasonable prices . despite the company 's product line , olaf ernst , head of the e-book program at springer science , disagreed with the widespread notion that online books would cause fewer printed books to be sold . " a printed book is still used differently than an electronic one , " said .
" the electronic area works kind of like a databank , in which you search and find something .
once you find it , you then go to the printed book , because you can work with it better , " he said . ernst 's clientele in particular was unlikely to make the switch , he said .
scientists like to leaf through books , and it 's still easier to do that with printed literature , he said . gabriela schaaf -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book fair opens with focus on india , digital publishing the world 's biggest book fair opened in frankfurt on tuesday evening , shining a spotlight on the flourishing literary scene in guest country india and the rise of the internet as a challenge to the printed word .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 08.10.2006 breaking the ramadan fast in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparing for iftar ramadan might not be as present in germany as in predominantly muslim countries , but throughout the country and even in the smallest towns , people gather together to break the fast . at a mosque in germany 's northern-most state of schleswig-holstein , the men 's eyes sparkle for a moment as they watch pictures on turkish television of thousands of people ending the ramadan fast for the day in istanbul .
it 's a far cry from the bustle and excitement of that great iftar , the muslim evening meal that breaks the month of day-long fasting . two dozen men have gathered to eat a more modest iftar meal .
the group , mostly turkish-born but with a pakistani and bosnian among them , serve themselves meat dishes and fragrant rice with sliced almonds .
they wait for the moment of sunset on the day 's ramadan calendar and then each eats the customary date to start the meal . it does not take long for the ground-floor room to empty as they finish eating .
some move away quietly to pray and others go out to chat in the social room .
outside , most of the population is not even aware that the annual fasting month is happening . this is a part of germany , said one man , where the locals keep to themselves and consider themselves sociable if they greet a neighbor and say nothing else all day . bringing ramadan to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally ramadan is broken with dates , like the ones from this market in turkey the television coverage from turkey has invoked a feeling of yearning in some of the men to feel " at home , " to be among up to 15,000 guests breaking their fast in great tents in istanbul that are set up every year by rich benefactors and open to all comers , every evening of ramadan . at ramadan night prayers , the car park is full as 80 men and boys gather in a capacious loft that has been converted into the mosque 's main prayer room .
the leaders of the community , affiliated to the semi-official turkish religious body ditib , are proud of the center that opened in 1991 with the mosque , a shop , travel agency and social center on a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 43,000-square-feet -rrb- site with a big garden next to a wooded stream . mehmet demirbilek , a courier driver who was born near the black sea coast of turkey and came to germany in 1972 , said the official membership list of only 140 at the center belies its true influence in this area of germany . continuing the tradition the mosque is located in norderstedt , a town of schleswig-holstein state that is mainly a dormitory for the big nearby city of hamburg .
if the outlying areas of hamburg are included , an estimated 1,400 turks live in the area .
with arab and other muslims included , perhaps the number is 2,000 , and this mosque is open to all of them , he said . no one knows how many of these are observing the ramadan fast and ending the day with an iftar in the privacy of their own homes .
there is an uncomfortable silence when they are asked about westernized muslims who ignore the custom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramadan events in germany are smaller-scale " in islam , we are not supposed to judge others , " said 55-year-old nuri ahrens , an auto repairer who has lived in germany for the past 20 years . while most of the men at the iftar are single , or away from their wives , ahrens has left his wife at home for a women 's iftar . " she invites other women around to the place in the evening , " he added . " my heart has grown cold in this place " for those seeking the most sumptuous iftar meals , the big city of hamburg has restaurants that serve halal food approved by islam , but it is hard to get a seat at an iftar table : during ramadan , the restaurants are booked out months in advance . amid the companionship of the men 's nightly meal , some of the talk becomes a cry from the heart against the german society where they live .
one young man who has been a university student in the state capital kiel said he has resolved to move home to turkey . " if you were to take out my heart , you would find nothing but love there , " he said .
" i have no hate .
but my heart has grown cold in this place . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's muslim of choice he 's the man eu officials and journalists alike seek out when islam and western europe do n't see eye-to-eye .

small publishers , though , have a tough time paying the high fees .

it 's a far cry from the bustle and excitement of that great iftar , the muslim evening meal that breaks the month of day-long fasting . two dozen men have gathered to eat a more modest iftar meal .
the group , mostly turkish-born but with a pakistani and bosnian among them , serve themselves meat dishes and fragrant rice with sliced almonds .
they wait for the moment of sunset on the day 's ramadan calendar and then each eats the customary date to start the meal . it does not take long for the ground-floor room to empty as they finish eating .
some move away quietly to pray and others go out to chat in the social room .
outside , most of the population is not even aware that the annual fasting month is happening . this is a part of germany , said one man , where the locals keep to themselves and consider themselves sociable if they greet a neighbor and say nothing else all day . bringing ramadan to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally ramadan is broken with dates , like the ones from this market in turkey the television coverage from turkey has invoked a feeling of yearning in some of the men to feel " at home , " to be among up to 15,000 guests breaking their fast in great tents in istanbul that are set up every year by rich benefactors and open to all comers , every evening of ramadan . at ramadan night prayers , the car park is full as 80 men and boys gather in a capacious loft that has been converted into the mosque 's main prayer room .

with arab and other muslims included , perhaps the number is 2,000 , and this mosque is open to all of them , he said . no one knows how many of these are observing the ramadan fast and ending the day with an iftar in the privacy of their own homes .

" she invites other women around to the place in the evening , " he added . " my heart has grown cold in this place " for those seeking the most sumptuous iftar meals , the big city of hamburg has restaurants that serve halal food approved by islam , but it is hard to get a seat at an iftar table : during ramadan , the restaurants are booked out months in advance . amid the companionship of the men 's nightly meal , some of the talk becomes a cry from the heart against the german society where they live .

it 's a far cry from the bustle and excitement of that great iftar , the muslim evening meal that breaks the month of day-long fasting . two dozen men have gathered to eat a more modest iftar meal .
the group , mostly turkish-born but with a pakistani and bosnian among them , serve themselves meat dishes and fragrant rice with sliced almonds .
they wait for the moment of sunset on the day 's ramadan calendar and then each eats the customary date to start the meal . it does not take long for the ground-floor room to empty as they finish eating .
some move away quietly to pray and others go out to chat in the social room .
outside , most of the population is not even aware that the annual fasting month is happening . this is a part of germany , said one man , where the locals keep to themselves and consider themselves sociable if they greet a neighbor and say nothing else all day . bringing ramadan to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally ramadan is broken with dates , like the ones from this market in turkey the television coverage from turkey has invoked a feeling of yearning in some of the men to feel " at home , " to be among up to 15,000 guests breaking their fast in great tents in istanbul that are set up every year by rich benefactors and open to all comers , every evening of ramadan . at ramadan night prayers , the car park is full as 80 men and boys gather in a capacious loft that has been converted into the mosque 's main prayer room .
the leaders of the community , affiliated to the semi-official turkish religious body ditib , are proud of the center that opened in 1991 with the mosque , a shop , travel agency and social center on a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 43,000-square-feet -rrb- site with a big garden next to a wooded stream . mehmet demirbilek , a courier driver who was born near the black sea coast of turkey and came to germany in 1972 , said the official membership list of only 140 at the center belies its true influence in this area of germany . continuing the tradition the mosque is located in norderstedt , a town of schleswig-holstein state that is mainly a dormitory for the big nearby city of hamburg .
if the outlying areas of hamburg are included , an estimated 1,400 turks live in the area .
with arab and other muslims included , perhaps the number is 2,000 , and this mosque is open to all of them , he said . no one knows how many of these are observing the ramadan fast and ending the day with an iftar in the privacy of their own homes .
there is an uncomfortable silence when they are asked about westernized muslims who ignore the custom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramadan events in germany are smaller-scale " in islam , we are not supposed to judge others , " said 55-year-old nuri ahrens , an auto repairer who has lived in germany for the past 20 years . while most of the men at the iftar are single , or away from their wives , ahrens has left his wife at home for a women 's iftar . " she invites other women around to the place in the evening , " he added . " my heart has grown cold in this place " for those seeking the most sumptuous iftar meals , the big city of hamburg has restaurants that serve halal food approved by islam , but it is hard to get a seat at an iftar table : during ramadan , the restaurants are booked out months in advance . amid the companionship of the men 's nightly meal , some of the talk becomes a cry from the heart against the german society where they live .
one young man who has been a university student in the state capital kiel said he has resolved to move home to turkey . " if you were to take out my heart , you would find nothing but love there , " he said .
" i have no hate .
but my heart has grown cold in this place . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's muslim of choice he 's the man eu officials and journalists alike seek out when islam and western europe do n't see eye-to-eye .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 08.10.2006 a century of hair-raising style as the perm turns 100 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's paul breitner was the first perm wearer to score in a world cup final a favorite of soccer players and american wrestlers , the perm has gotten a bad rap as a hairstyle choice .
but it 's still here 100 years after it was created , and many famous people have a german to thank for their curls . it would be one of the most star-studded events of the last hundred years if all those who have donned the famous do were to celebrate a century of the perm on sunday . the style with bounce and body amazingly turns 100 this weekend , and while there will not be any major festivities in its home nation of germany , a gathering of all those who have ever been crowned by the permanent wave or dauerwelle would be some party . most people would want to be at that hypothetical celebration , where german hairdresser karl nessler , the father of the perm , would sit back and look at his crowning glory on the heads of some of history 's trendsetters . the innovator would be overwhelmed by how far his process had come since its first public display back on oct .
8 , 1906 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those about to rock : robert plant and curls not for those like led zeppelin 's robert plant the weighted hot rollers of nessler 's first contraption ; a machine , which it should be said , burnt off all the hair and some of the scalp of his first model , the inventor 's long-suffering wife katharina laible . prisoner of war to perm guru many famous people have been glad that nessler was released from captivity by the british after world war i and made it to the shores of the united states , where his technology would really evolve and the perm as a fashion must-have would explode onto the trendiest of scenes . it was in his adopted new york that the german pioneer really got the chance to tease and please , but as the perm became increasingly popular , the hairdo spread across the globe like barry manilow 's mane flowing over a velvet chaise longue .
the guest list at nessler 's fantasy perm party would be eclectic and international . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david hasselhoff 's perm earned him many admirers nessler would be in some pretty auspicious company as the good and great paid homage to his pioneering follicular technology .
no doubt david hasselhoff would stop him as he cruised the room to offer a hand of thanks for topping the look that made michael knight the heartthrob hero of early 1980s television . the queue to shake the coiffure visionary 's hand would have stretched all the way to the complimentary curlers , with the likes of hollywood stars meg ryan , julia roberts and catherine zeta jones all lining up to swap teasing tips with the great man himself . giving soccer stars the curl many would owe herr nessler a similar debt of gratitude .
would rudi völler have made it to the top of world soccer had he not sported a permed mullet for the entirety of his career and beyond ?
would the german world cup winner have been just another player without that cascading rug of curls providing that extra bounce to his heading ability ?
one rather doubts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi took the perm to new lengths with his mullet combo and england 's 1970s star kevin keegan would possibly have been an expensive flop had he not arrived at sv hamburg with a perm which looked like it needed an expert in topiary rather than a hairdresser to keep it in check .
those back-to-back european player of the year awards would have been a distant dream had keego decided on short-back-and-sides as the way to go in the bundesliga . once through the masses of soccer stars who have championed the perm , herr nessler would surely then be forced to feel the love of the legends of the music world .
the stars of 1980s soft rock alone could fill a room , albeit one with more than adequate ventilation and a sturdy fire escape . rock royalty with a crown of curls bildunterschrift : slippery when wet : bon jovi championed curls throughout the 1980s parting the likes of bon jovi and europe as moses did the red sea , nessler would then seek an audience with madonna , who did much to champion his hairstyle throughout her early career and who helped spawn kyle minogue 's early look . flicking a coiffed look over his shoulder as he sashayed out of his own party , nessler would be forgiven for shedding a tear or two . his immortal style may have come and gone and then come back into fashion again ; it may have been lauded and ridiculed in equal measure , it may have given the world 's wrestlers a reason to live … but after all that , the perm is 100 years old and still with us . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the long and short of world cup haircuts forget the thrill of the game , the rush of goals and the fervor of the fans .
for some , the players ' haircuts are the most closely watched trend at the world cup .

he has no savings so lives in hope of getting the money to restart his life .
even if he is paid now , asim wo n't be able to rebuild his house before winter and must remain in temporary shelter .
many of those who started rebuilding had to stop halfway because compensation was insufficient or has not yet arrived .
imtiaz kashmiri , another katahi resident , got as far as laying the foundation of his new house before he ran out of money .
he spent whatever savings he had , hoping the housing grant would arrive in due course - but after a year it has still not come .
now he has no option but to spend another winter in a makeshift camp .
every time mr kashmiri visits erra 's muzaffarabad office to claim his money , he is told to wait as the survey team that assessed his damage has not mentioned which type of house it was .
there are believed to be more than 10,000 home owners who have not been paid because of such small disputes .

construction industry experts say building an average house according to erra guidelines costs approximately 400,000 rupees .
but for those far from a main road or town , that figure can rise to 700,000 rupees - far more than the housing grant .
many people are also sceptical about building houses out of bricks and mortar , as recommended by the authorities .
they say the materials push costs up and are not safe , as well as being difficult to transport .
" we can not build concrete houses because we saw our children , family members and relatives crushed under the stones in the earthquake , " says muhammad sadiq in gujjar bandi , another village near katahi .

people 's anger seems to have forced erra to realise some of their difficulties .
sardar sadiq khan , director general of reconstruction and rehabilitation , said people in remote areas were now being allowed to build wood houses rather than concrete ones .
this decision had been made " keeping in view the difficulties in transportation of building material to inaccessible areas and high transportation cost " , he says .
locals say if the decision had come sooner they could have built houses before winter and accuse erra officials of being out of touch .
reconstruction in the regional capital , muzaffarabad , and bagh to the south has not taken off because the government has yet to finalise master plans for the two cities .
under the proposals more than 5,000 families will be relocated because they live near fault lines or roads which are to be widened .
those in muzaffarabad are to go to proposed satellite towns nearby , but the land has still not been purchased .
asian development bank country director peter fedon said last week that rebuilding 600,000 homes and other buildings may take eight years .
pakistan 's authorities says it will take three to five years , but realistically it will take far longer given the terrain and weather conditions .

last updated : sunday , 8 october 2006 , 07:53 gmt 08:53 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version wales : disability - double anxiety mark hannaby the politics show wales the drive for savings may mean punitive welfare decisions those working for disabled people fear the welfare reform bill going through parliament may put some people under undue pressure to return to work or face benefit cuts .
in wales , there are also claims that those needing home care are facing far higher bills as a consequence of a change in assembly government policy .
the welfare system across britain is in the midst of major reform .
the uk government wants to save £ 7bn by getting people off benefits and back to work .
some working on behalf of disabled people fear the desire to make savings may already be resulting in harsh decisions on benefits .
clive oliver of powys welfare rights forum said : " we 're finding more and more people claiming disability benefits being turned down and a lot more cases are going to appeal tribunal .
" my organisation is winning about 93 or 94 % of tribunals which somewhere along the line means somebody is not making good decisions . "
on the right path ?
the government 's " pathways to work " project to help those on incapacity benefit return to work was trialled in mp chris bryant 's rhondda constituency .
he says disabled people need not fear the changes .
being forced back into work may be detrimental to health mr bryant said : " what we 've been doing locally has made such a difference because we 've had an individual at the job centre plus office working very determinedly on the side of the person who 's seeking work , trying to find ways of using the abilities that they do have rather than focusing on the disabilities that they have . "
welfare changes effect people across the uk but in wales its claimed those with disabilities currently face an additional pressure .
the charges councils make to provide home care for the disabled have risen in many cases .
it had been anticipated that the assembly government 's plan to provide free home care would cover these rises .
but in february this year that policy was scrapped .
now it 's claimed disabled people are picking up the price rise tab .
jenny hambidge of disability powys said : " throughout wales , we have evidence that people were being reassessed , their charges were being reassessed .
" it 's our opinion , and it 's an educated opinion , that charges have gone up and we suspect it was in expectation of the money that was going to come from the welsh assembly government .
" now this has left disabled people in an invidious position because a lot of us have been reassessed and have been left with higher charges than we were before . "
fees hike one of disability powys ' clients was paying £ 57.20 a week for home care .
his local authority are now asking him for £ 180 a week - over treble the amount .
ms hambidge said other clients are no longer getting the help they need because they can not afford the new costs .
chief executive of disability wales , rhian davies , noted that , since councils expected to be compensated by the assembly government for providing free care , there was no incentive for them to keep prices low .
rhian davies said : " the funds would have been divvied out amongst the various local authorities .
" so of course those local authorities paying the higher charges stood to gain the most from the grant scheme . "
the assembly government says the setting of charges is a matter for councils .
but a task group including disability wales is working on ways to increase the amount of income disabled people retain after charging for home care .
up to £ 17m has been set aside to implement the group 's proposals from april 2007 .

last updated : sunday , 8 october 2006 , 07:53 gmt 08:53 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version wales : disability - double anxiety mark hannaby the politics show wales the drive for savings may mean punitive welfare decisions those working for disabled people fear the welfare reform bill going through parliament may put some people under undue pressure to return to work or face benefit cuts .
in wales , there are also claims that those needing home care are facing far higher bills as a consequence of a change in assembly government policy .
the welfare system across britain is in the midst of major reform .
the uk government wants to save £ 7bn by getting people off benefits and back to work .
some working on behalf of disabled people fear the desire to make savings may already be resulting in harsh decisions on benefits .
clive oliver of powys welfare rights forum said : " we 're finding more and more people claiming disability benefits being turned down and a lot more cases are going to appeal tribunal .
" my organisation is winning about 93 or 94 % of tribunals which somewhere along the line means somebody is not making good decisions . "
on the right path ?
the government 's " pathways to work " project to help those on incapacity benefit return to work was trialled in mp chris bryant 's rhondda constituency .
he says disabled people need not fear the changes .
being forced back into work may be detrimental to health mr bryant said : " what we 've been doing locally has made such a difference because we 've had an individual at the job centre plus office working very determinedly on the side of the person who 's seeking work , trying to find ways of using the abilities that they do have rather than focusing on the disabilities that they have . "
welfare changes effect people across the uk but in wales its claimed those with disabilities currently face an additional pressure .
the charges councils make to provide home care for the disabled have risen in many cases .
it had been anticipated that the assembly government 's plan to provide free home care would cover these rises .
but in february this year that policy was scrapped .
now it 's claimed disabled people are picking up the price rise tab .
jenny hambidge of disability powys said : " throughout wales , we have evidence that people were being reassessed , their charges were being reassessed .
" it 's our opinion , and it 's an educated opinion , that charges have gone up and we suspect it was in expectation of the money that was going to come from the welsh assembly government .
" now this has left disabled people in an invidious position because a lot of us have been reassessed and have been left with higher charges than we were before . "
fees hike one of disability powys ' clients was paying £ 57.20 a week for home care .
his local authority are now asking him for £ 180 a week - over treble the amount .
ms hambidge said other clients are no longer getting the help they need because they can not afford the new costs .
chief executive of disability wales , rhian davies , noted that , since councils expected to be compensated by the assembly government for providing free care , there was no incentive for them to keep prices low .
rhian davies said : " the funds would have been divvied out amongst the various local authorities .
" so of course those local authorities paying the higher charges stood to gain the most from the grant scheme . "
the assembly government says the setting of charges is a matter for councils .
but a task group including disability wales is working on ways to increase the amount of income disabled people retain after charging for home care .
up to £ 17m has been set aside to implement the group 's proposals from april 2007 .

the politics show has learned that some labour mps in the most marginal seats have been given " carte-blanche " to campaign against plans to reorganise hospitals in england .
this would see a number of district hospitals being down-graded .
party managers are concerned that a backlash against the plans could result in a spate of independent candidates challenging labour mps on the hospitals issue .
the conservatives have seized on the plan , beginning a campaign to help activists attack " brown 's nhs cuts " .
and david cameron told the conservative party conference last week that " it is not just a question of saying the nhs is safe in my hands - of course it will be .
my family is so often in the hands of the nhs , so i want them to be safe there " .
a senior labour figure told the politics show : " the conservatives see this as our achilles ' heel and they are right " .
no compromise he added that while mps had been armed with the arguments for hospital reform and told to campaign locally and work with local groups , there was " no master plan " for dealing with the issue .
and number 10 is believed to be reluctant to compromise on reorganisation in the face of political pressure .
but with tony blair expected to step down in a matter of months , his successor may take a very different view when faced with the realities of a general election .
