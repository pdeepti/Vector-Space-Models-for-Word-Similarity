" we were n't very far from a european blackout , " pierre bornard , a member of the board of directors of the french power company rte , told the afp news agency . the german energy company rwe said the trouble was due to a surge in demand late saturday when temperatures plummeted to the freezing point . " not enough power was being generated in the network , " a rwe spokesman said , adding that the outage became a pan-european incident because the supply was on a shared network . the spokesman also said a failure outside the company 's network was responsible for the outage . " initial findings indicate that the disturbance was due to excessive strain on the grid in northwestern germany , " e.on , germany 's biggest power supplier , said in a statement . blackout spread from germany # b # an insufficient power supply first triggered blackouts in parts of southern and western germany , particularly in cologne , and then spread to france as the french electricity company edf tried to meet surging consumer needs , leading to what what bornard called a " house of cards " style breakdown .
parts of italy and spain also experienced power outages . in order to avoid a complete blackout , " automatic security systems sharply cut " supplies to some customers , he said , noting : " it all happened in several seconds . " the loss in power , which occurred around 10 p.m.
central european time , prompted a ripple effect in spanish power stations as facilities automatically shut down to protect them from power surges .
also affected was the connection between spain and morocco , a spokesperson for spanish power concern red electrica said sunday . the cross-border power wobble was also felt in belgium , where trains halted saturday between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. " luckily the power did n't fail at 5 p.m. on a friday evening , " a spokesperson for railway operator sncb said . the outages resulted in thousands of panicked calls to police and fire departments , but there did not appear to be any serious damages caused by the lack of power . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a new energy wave for europe in portugal the portuguese coast has become europe 's latest source of renewable energy .

this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .
many of them are located in low-lying coastal areas and have already experienced floods and droughts .
the second is that they have less economic power to cope with climate change .
so the convention recognizes this and is taking responsibility and trying to provide support to those countries which are vulnerable .
is technology really the answer because , surely , in the long-term none of these will really be able to stand up to the force that is climate change ?
yes , the convention recognized this and countries are making commitments to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit so that in future the stress on the climate will be reduced .
in the long-term , mitigation should provide the answer and reducing those emissions is crucial .
so , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ?

klaus jacobs , who made a fortune in roasting and importing coffee , wants to set a precedent . german-born swiss billionaire klaus jacobs , 69 , best known for the coffee brand that bears his name , pledged a record donation of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- to a private university in his hometown of bremen .
it 's the largest single gift ever given to a german education institution . the donation , which will be made through a family foundation , involves a gift of 15 million euros per year for the next five years as well as a lump sum of 125 million euros in 2011 , and follows the announcement last month of three publicly funded " elite " universities in germany , which will be receiving 100 million euros each in government support . private donations are rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus jacobs made a fortune in the coffee roasting and import business since the university system is mainly publicly financed , private donations , which are common in britain and the united states , are rare in germany .
jacobs , who lives near cambridge , and is now chairman of adecco , the world 's largest temporary employment group , said he wants to set a philanthropic example to the german business community . " there 's enough money around .
the germans have lived 60 years in peace , and the country is rich , " jacobs told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" in switzerland , holland and belgium , not just in the english-speaking countries , businesses and private individuals are much more involved in supporting education … of course , there are exceptions such as the bosch foundation , but not much has happened since the end of the war . " university offers broad , english language curriculum the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , which was launched in 2001 as germany 's only private institution that offers a broad curriculum of arts , engineering and sciences in the english language , has an enrolment of over 1,000 students from 86 countries and will be renamed jacob university bremen . the university , however , will have a free hand in defining its academic priorities , jacobs said . three-quarters of the university 's student body is foreign , and iub maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio of ten-to-one , which is lower than other universities in germany . tuition is steep by german standards , ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 euros per year , with many students , in particular those from eastern europe , requiring scholarships and loans to cover the cost of studying at the iub . financial struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donations will enable private universities to attract the best scholars the university , which has yet to raise one-third of the 250 million euros in initial capital since its founding , has struggled financially .
competitive salaries are needed to keep the best professors , who are ready to bolt when they are offered tenured positions and state benefits at public universities , according to a commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " iub will now be able to reach that high level of quality that is indispensable for competing with the best schools worldwide , " said jacobs , who once studied at stanford university . jacobs , who has been oft criticized for trading his german passport for a swiss one , moved his family-owned coffee roasting and importing company to switzerland 33 years ago , and in 1990 , sold jacobs-suchard to the tobacco conglomerate philip morris , which in turn sold it to kraft foods inc . to the disappointment of the students , the university 's president , joachim treusch , said there will be no free jacobs coffee served on campus . " well , we like jacobs coffee , but i do n't think that is a connection that in any way influences our academic development , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de corporate sponsors in the halls of german academia for germany 's cash-strapped state-run universities , naming a lecture hall after a corporate sponsor has become a source of private financing .

this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .
many of them are located in low-lying coastal areas and have already experienced floods and droughts .
the second is that they have less economic power to cope with climate change .
so the convention recognizes this and is taking responsibility and trying to provide support to those countries which are vulnerable .
is technology really the answer because , surely , in the long-term none of these will really be able to stand up to the force that is climate change ?
yes , the convention recognized this and countries are making commitments to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit so that in future the stress on the climate will be reduced .
in the long-term , mitigation should provide the answer and reducing those emissions is crucial .
so , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ?
yes , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done . anja kueppers interviewed florin vladu send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : combatting climate change living planet looks at innovative energy projects that reduce environmentally damaging greenhouse gases .

klaus jacobs , who made a fortune in roasting and importing coffee , wants to set a precedent . german-born swiss billionaire klaus jacobs , 69 , best known for the coffee brand that bears his name , pledged a record donation of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- to a private university in his hometown of bremen .
it 's the largest single gift ever given to a german education institution . the donation , which will be made through a family foundation , involves a gift of 15 million euros per year for the next five years as well as a lump sum of 125 million euros in 2011 , and follows the announcement last month of three publicly funded " elite " universities in germany , which will be receiving 100 million euros each in government support . private donations are rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus jacobs made a fortune in the coffee roasting and import business since the university system is mainly publicly financed , private donations , which are common in britain and the united states , are rare in germany .
jacobs , who lives near cambridge , and is now chairman of adecco , the world 's largest temporary employment group , said he wants to set a philanthropic example to the german business community . " there 's enough money around .
the germans have lived 60 years in peace , and the country is rich , " jacobs told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" in switzerland , holland and belgium , not just in the english-speaking countries , businesses and private individuals are much more involved in supporting education … of course , there are exceptions such as the bosch foundation , but not much has happened since the end of the war . " university offers broad , english language curriculum the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , which was launched in 2001 as germany 's only private institution that offers a broad curriculum of arts , engineering and sciences in the english language , has an enrolment of over 1,000 students from 86 countries and will be renamed jacob university bremen . the university , however , will have a free hand in defining its academic priorities , jacobs said . three-quarters of the university 's student body is foreign , and iub maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio of ten-to-one , which is lower than other universities in germany . tuition is steep by german standards , ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 euros per year , with many students , in particular those from eastern europe , requiring scholarships and loans to cover the cost of studying at the iub . financial struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donations will enable private universities to attract the best scholars the university , which has yet to raise one-third of the 250 million euros in initial capital since its founding , has struggled financially .
competitive salaries are needed to keep the best professors , who are ready to bolt when they are offered tenured positions and state benefits at public universities , according to a commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " iub will now be able to reach that high level of quality that is indispensable for competing with the best schools worldwide , " said jacobs , who once studied at stanford university . jacobs , who has been oft criticized for trading his german passport for a swiss one , moved his family-owned coffee roasting and importing company to switzerland 33 years ago , and in 1990 , sold jacobs-suchard to the tobacco conglomerate philip morris , which in turn sold it to kraft foods inc . to the disappointment of the students , the university 's president , joachim treusch , said there will be no free jacobs coffee served on campus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 05.11.2006 former coffee magnate makes record university donation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : universities in germany are mainly publicly financed , so private donations are rare private philanthropy in higher education , common in the us , britain and other countries , is rare in germany .
klaus jacobs , who made a fortune in roasting and importing coffee , wants to set a precedent . german-born swiss billionaire klaus jacobs , 69 , best known for the coffee brand that bears his name , pledged a record donation of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- to a private university in his hometown of bremen .
it 's the largest single gift ever given to a german education institution . the donation , which will be made through a family foundation , involves a gift of 15 million euros per year for the next five years as well as a lump sum of 125 million euros in 2011 , and follows the announcement last month of three publicly funded " elite " universities in germany , which will be receiving 100 million euros each in government support . private donations are rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus jacobs made a fortune in the coffee roasting and import business since the university system is mainly publicly financed , private donations , which are common in britain and the united states , are rare in germany .
jacobs , who lives near cambridge , and is now chairman of adecco , the world 's largest temporary employment group , said he wants to set a philanthropic example to the german business community . " there 's enough money around .
the germans have lived 60 years in peace , and the country is rich , " jacobs told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" in switzerland , holland and belgium , not just in the english-speaking countries , businesses and private individuals are much more involved in supporting education … of course , there are exceptions such as the bosch foundation , but not much has happened since the end of the war . " university offers broad , english language curriculum the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , which was launched in 2001 as germany 's only private institution that offers a broad curriculum of arts , engineering and sciences in the english language , has an enrolment of over 1,000 students from 86 countries and will be renamed jacob university bremen . the university , however , will have a free hand in defining its academic priorities , jacobs said . three-quarters of the university 's student body is foreign , and iub maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio of ten-to-one , which is lower than other universities in germany . tuition is steep by german standards , ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 euros per year , with many students , in particular those from eastern europe , requiring scholarships and loans to cover the cost of studying at the iub . financial struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donations will enable private universities to attract the best scholars the university , which has yet to raise one-third of the 250 million euros in initial capital since its founding , has struggled financially .
competitive salaries are needed to keep the best professors , who are ready to bolt when they are offered tenured positions and state benefits at public universities , according to a commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " iub will now be able to reach that high level of quality that is indispensable for competing with the best schools worldwide , " said jacobs , who once studied at stanford university . jacobs , who has been oft criticized for trading his german passport for a swiss one , moved his family-owned coffee roasting and importing company to switzerland 33 years ago , and in 1990 , sold jacobs-suchard to the tobacco conglomerate philip morris , which in turn sold it to kraft foods inc . to the disappointment of the students , the university 's president , joachim treusch , said there will be no free jacobs coffee served on campus . " well , we like jacobs coffee , but i do n't think that is a connection that in any way influences our academic development , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de corporate sponsors in the halls of german academia for germany 's cash-strapped state-run universities , naming a lecture hall after a corporate sponsor has become a source of private financing .

this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .
many of them are located in low-lying coastal areas and have already experienced floods and droughts .
the second is that they have less economic power to cope with climate change .
so the convention recognizes this and is taking responsibility and trying to provide support to those countries which are vulnerable .
is technology really the answer because , surely , in the long-term none of these will really be able to stand up to the force that is climate change ?
yes , the convention recognized this and countries are making commitments to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit so that in future the stress on the climate will be reduced .
in the long-term , mitigation should provide the answer and reducing those emissions is crucial .
so , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ?

klaus jacobs , who made a fortune in roasting and importing coffee , wants to set a precedent . german-born swiss billionaire klaus jacobs , 69 , best known for the coffee brand that bears his name , pledged a record donation of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- to a private university in his hometown of bremen .
it 's the largest single gift ever given to a german education institution . the donation , which will be made through a family foundation , involves a gift of 15 million euros per year for the next five years as well as a lump sum of 125 million euros in 2011 , and follows the announcement last month of three publicly funded " elite " universities in germany , which will be receiving 100 million euros each in government support . private donations are rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus jacobs made a fortune in the coffee roasting and import business since the university system is mainly publicly financed , private donations , which are common in britain and the united states , are rare in germany .
jacobs , who lives near cambridge , and is now chairman of adecco , the world 's largest temporary employment group , said he wants to set a philanthropic example to the german business community . " there 's enough money around .
the germans have lived 60 years in peace , and the country is rich , " jacobs told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" in switzerland , holland and belgium , not just in the english-speaking countries , businesses and private individuals are much more involved in supporting education … of course , there are exceptions such as the bosch foundation , but not much has happened since the end of the war . " university offers broad , english language curriculum the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , which was launched in 2001 as germany 's only private institution that offers a broad curriculum of arts , engineering and sciences in the english language , has an enrolment of over 1,000 students from 86 countries and will be renamed jacob university bremen . the university , however , will have a free hand in defining its academic priorities , jacobs said . three-quarters of the university 's student body is foreign , and iub maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio of ten-to-one , which is lower than other universities in germany . tuition is steep by german standards , ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 euros per year , with many students , in particular those from eastern europe , requiring scholarships and loans to cover the cost of studying at the iub . financial struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donations will enable private universities to attract the best scholars the university , which has yet to raise one-third of the 250 million euros in initial capital since its founding , has struggled financially .
competitive salaries are needed to keep the best professors , who are ready to bolt when they are offered tenured positions and state benefits at public universities , according to a commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " iub will now be able to reach that high level of quality that is indispensable for competing with the best schools worldwide , " said jacobs , who once studied at stanford university . jacobs , who has been oft criticized for trading his german passport for a swiss one , moved his family-owned coffee roasting and importing company to switzerland 33 years ago , and in 1990 , sold jacobs-suchard to the tobacco conglomerate philip morris , which in turn sold it to kraft foods inc . to the disappointment of the students , the university 's president , joachim treusch , said there will be no free jacobs coffee served on campus .

this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .
many of them are located in low-lying coastal areas and have already experienced floods and droughts .
the second is that they have less economic power to cope with climate change .
so the convention recognizes this and is taking responsibility and trying to provide support to those countries which are vulnerable .
is technology really the answer because , surely , in the long-term none of these will really be able to stand up to the force that is climate change ?
yes , the convention recognized this and countries are making commitments to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit so that in future the stress on the climate will be reduced .
in the long-term , mitigation should provide the answer and reducing those emissions is crucial .
so , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ?
yes , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done . anja kueppers interviewed florin vladu send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : combatting climate change living planet looks at innovative energy projects that reduce environmentally damaging greenhouse gases .

klaus jacobs , who made a fortune in roasting and importing coffee , wants to set a precedent . german-born swiss billionaire klaus jacobs , 69 , best known for the coffee brand that bears his name , pledged a record donation of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- to a private university in his hometown of bremen .
it 's the largest single gift ever given to a german education institution . the donation , which will be made through a family foundation , involves a gift of 15 million euros per year for the next five years as well as a lump sum of 125 million euros in 2011 , and follows the announcement last month of three publicly funded " elite " universities in germany , which will be receiving 100 million euros each in government support . private donations are rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus jacobs made a fortune in the coffee roasting and import business since the university system is mainly publicly financed , private donations , which are common in britain and the united states , are rare in germany .
jacobs , who lives near cambridge , and is now chairman of adecco , the world 's largest temporary employment group , said he wants to set a philanthropic example to the german business community . " there 's enough money around .
the germans have lived 60 years in peace , and the country is rich , " jacobs told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" in switzerland , holland and belgium , not just in the english-speaking countries , businesses and private individuals are much more involved in supporting education … of course , there are exceptions such as the bosch foundation , but not much has happened since the end of the war . " university offers broad , english language curriculum the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , which was launched in 2001 as germany 's only private institution that offers a broad curriculum of arts , engineering and sciences in the english language , has an enrolment of over 1,000 students from 86 countries and will be renamed jacob university bremen . the university , however , will have a free hand in defining its academic priorities , jacobs said . three-quarters of the university 's student body is foreign , and iub maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio of ten-to-one , which is lower than other universities in germany . tuition is steep by german standards , ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 euros per year , with many students , in particular those from eastern europe , requiring scholarships and loans to cover the cost of studying at the iub . financial struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donations will enable private universities to attract the best scholars the university , which has yet to raise one-third of the 250 million euros in initial capital since its founding , has struggled financially .
competitive salaries are needed to keep the best professors , who are ready to bolt when they are offered tenured positions and state benefits at public universities , according to a commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " iub will now be able to reach that high level of quality that is indispensable for competing with the best schools worldwide , " said jacobs , who once studied at stanford university . jacobs , who has been oft criticized for trading his german passport for a swiss one , moved his family-owned coffee roasting and importing company to switzerland 33 years ago , and in 1990 , sold jacobs-suchard to the tobacco conglomerate philip morris , which in turn sold it to kraft foods inc . to the disappointment of the students , the university 's president , joachim treusch , said there will be no free jacobs coffee served on campus . " well , we like jacobs coffee , but i do n't think that is a connection that in any way influences our academic development , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de corporate sponsors in the halls of german academia for germany 's cash-strapped state-run universities , naming a lecture hall after a corporate sponsor has become a source of private financing .

this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .
many of them are located in low-lying coastal areas and have already experienced floods and droughts .
the second is that they have less economic power to cope with climate change .
so the convention recognizes this and is taking responsibility and trying to provide support to those countries which are vulnerable .
is technology really the answer because , surely , in the long-term none of these will really be able to stand up to the force that is climate change ?
yes , the convention recognized this and countries are making commitments to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit so that in future the stress on the climate will be reduced .
in the long-term , mitigation should provide the answer and reducing those emissions is crucial .
so , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ?
yes , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done . anja kueppers interviewed florin vladu send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : combatting climate change living planet looks at innovative energy projects that reduce environmentally damaging greenhouse gases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de living planet -pipe- 05.11.2006 interview : “ there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ” großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people need to adapt to the changes caused by global warming , such as increased flooding as changes in the climate become increasingly obvious , the international community has started devoting more attention to the idea of “ adaptation . ”
this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .
many of them are located in low-lying coastal areas and have already experienced floods and droughts .
the second is that they have less economic power to cope with climate change .
so the convention recognizes this and is taking responsibility and trying to provide support to those countries which are vulnerable .
is technology really the answer because , surely , in the long-term none of these will really be able to stand up to the force that is climate change ?
yes , the convention recognized this and countries are making commitments to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit so that in future the stress on the climate will be reduced .
in the long-term , mitigation should provide the answer and reducing those emissions is crucial .
so , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ?
yes , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done . anja kueppers interviewed florin vladu send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : combatting climate change living planet looks at innovative energy projects that reduce environmentally damaging greenhouse gases .

" we were n't very far from a european blackout , " pierre bornard , a member of the board of directors of the french power company rte , told the afp news agency . the german energy company rwe said the trouble was due to a surge in demand late saturday when temperatures plummeted to the freezing point .

klaus jacobs , who made a fortune in roasting and importing coffee , wants to set a precedent . german-born swiss billionaire klaus jacobs , 69 , best known for the coffee brand that bears his name , pledged a record donation of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- to a private university in his hometown of bremen .
it 's the largest single gift ever given to a german education institution . the donation , which will be made through a family foundation , involves a gift of 15 million euros per year for the next five years as well as a lump sum of 125 million euros in 2011 , and follows the announcement last month of three publicly funded " elite " universities in germany , which will be receiving 100 million euros each in government support . private donations are rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus jacobs made a fortune in the coffee roasting and import business since the university system is mainly publicly financed , private donations , which are common in britain and the united states , are rare in germany .
jacobs , who lives near cambridge , and is now chairman of adecco , the world 's largest temporary employment group , said he wants to set a philanthropic example to the german business community . " there 's enough money around .
the germans have lived 60 years in peace , and the country is rich , " jacobs told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" in switzerland , holland and belgium , not just in the english-speaking countries , businesses and private individuals are much more involved in supporting education … of course , there are exceptions such as the bosch foundation , but not much has happened since the end of the war . " university offers broad , english language curriculum the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , which was launched in 2001 as germany 's only private institution that offers a broad curriculum of arts , engineering and sciences in the english language , has an enrolment of over 1,000 students from 86 countries and will be renamed jacob university bremen . the university , however , will have a free hand in defining its academic priorities , jacobs said . three-quarters of the university 's student body is foreign , and iub maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio of ten-to-one , which is lower than other universities in germany . tuition is steep by german standards , ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 euros per year , with many students , in particular those from eastern europe , requiring scholarships and loans to cover the cost of studying at the iub . financial struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donations will enable private universities to attract the best scholars the university , which has yet to raise one-third of the 250 million euros in initial capital since its founding , has struggled financially .
competitive salaries are needed to keep the best professors , who are ready to bolt when they are offered tenured positions and state benefits at public universities , according to a commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " iub will now be able to reach that high level of quality that is indispensable for competing with the best schools worldwide , " said jacobs , who once studied at stanford university . jacobs , who has been oft criticized for trading his german passport for a swiss one , moved his family-owned coffee roasting and importing company to switzerland 33 years ago , and in 1990 , sold jacobs-suchard to the tobacco conglomerate philip morris , which in turn sold it to kraft foods inc . to the disappointment of the students , the university 's president , joachim treusch , said there will be no free jacobs coffee served on campus . " well , we like jacobs coffee , but i do n't think that is a connection that in any way influences our academic development , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de corporate sponsors in the halls of german academia for germany 's cash-strapped state-run universities , naming a lecture hall after a corporate sponsor has become a source of private financing .

" we were n't very far from a european blackout , " pierre bornard , a member of the board of directors of the french power company rte , told the afp news agency . the german energy company rwe said the trouble was due to a surge in demand late saturday when temperatures plummeted to the freezing point . " not enough power was being generated in the network , " a rwe spokesman said , adding that the outage became a pan-european incident because the supply was on a shared network . the spokesman also said a failure outside the company 's network was responsible for the outage . " initial findings indicate that the disturbance was due to excessive strain on the grid in northwestern germany , " e.on , germany 's biggest power supplier , said in a statement . blackout spread from germany # b # an insufficient power supply first triggered blackouts in parts of southern and western germany , particularly in cologne , and then spread to france as the french electricity company edf tried to meet surging consumer needs , leading to what what bornard called a " house of cards " style breakdown .
parts of italy and spain also experienced power outages . in order to avoid a complete blackout , " automatic security systems sharply cut " supplies to some customers , he said , noting : " it all happened in several seconds . " the loss in power , which occurred around 10 p.m.
central european time , prompted a ripple effect in spanish power stations as facilities automatically shut down to protect them from power surges .
also affected was the connection between spain and morocco , a spokesperson for spanish power concern red electrica said sunday . the cross-border power wobble was also felt in belgium , where trains halted saturday between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. " luckily the power did n't fail at 5 p.m. on a friday evening , " a spokesperson for railway operator sncb said . the outages resulted in thousands of panicked calls to police and fire departments , but there did not appear to be any serious damages caused by the lack of power . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a new energy wave for europe in portugal the portuguese coast has become europe 's latest source of renewable energy .

klaus jacobs , who made a fortune in roasting and importing coffee , wants to set a precedent . german-born swiss billionaire klaus jacobs , 69 , best known for the coffee brand that bears his name , pledged a record donation of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- to a private university in his hometown of bremen .
it 's the largest single gift ever given to a german education institution . the donation , which will be made through a family foundation , involves a gift of 15 million euros per year for the next five years as well as a lump sum of 125 million euros in 2011 , and follows the announcement last month of three publicly funded " elite " universities in germany , which will be receiving 100 million euros each in government support . private donations are rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus jacobs made a fortune in the coffee roasting and import business since the university system is mainly publicly financed , private donations , which are common in britain and the united states , are rare in germany .
jacobs , who lives near cambridge , and is now chairman of adecco , the world 's largest temporary employment group , said he wants to set a philanthropic example to the german business community . " there 's enough money around .
the germans have lived 60 years in peace , and the country is rich , " jacobs told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" in switzerland , holland and belgium , not just in the english-speaking countries , businesses and private individuals are much more involved in supporting education … of course , there are exceptions such as the bosch foundation , but not much has happened since the end of the war . " university offers broad , english language curriculum the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , which was launched in 2001 as germany 's only private institution that offers a broad curriculum of arts , engineering and sciences in the english language , has an enrolment of over 1,000 students from 86 countries and will be renamed jacob university bremen . the university , however , will have a free hand in defining its academic priorities , jacobs said . three-quarters of the university 's student body is foreign , and iub maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio of ten-to-one , which is lower than other universities in germany . tuition is steep by german standards , ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 euros per year , with many students , in particular those from eastern europe , requiring scholarships and loans to cover the cost of studying at the iub . financial struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donations will enable private universities to attract the best scholars the university , which has yet to raise one-third of the 250 million euros in initial capital since its founding , has struggled financially .
competitive salaries are needed to keep the best professors , who are ready to bolt when they are offered tenured positions and state benefits at public universities , according to a commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " iub will now be able to reach that high level of quality that is indispensable for competing with the best schools worldwide , " said jacobs , who once studied at stanford university . jacobs , who has been oft criticized for trading his german passport for a swiss one , moved his family-owned coffee roasting and importing company to switzerland 33 years ago , and in 1990 , sold jacobs-suchard to the tobacco conglomerate philip morris , which in turn sold it to kraft foods inc . to the disappointment of the students , the university 's president , joachim treusch , said there will be no free jacobs coffee served on campus . " well , we like jacobs coffee , but i do n't think that is a connection that in any way influences our academic development , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de corporate sponsors in the halls of german academia for germany 's cash-strapped state-run universities , naming a lecture hall after a corporate sponsor has become a source of private financing .

" we were n't very far from a european blackout , " pierre bornard , a member of the board of directors of the french power company rte , told the afp news agency . the german energy company rwe said the trouble was due to a surge in demand late saturday when temperatures plummeted to the freezing point . " not enough power was being generated in the network , " a rwe spokesman said , adding that the outage became a pan-european incident because the supply was on a shared network . the spokesman also said a failure outside the company 's network was responsible for the outage . " initial findings indicate that the disturbance was due to excessive strain on the grid in northwestern germany , " e.on , germany 's biggest power supplier , said in a statement . blackout spread from germany # b # an insufficient power supply first triggered blackouts in parts of southern and western germany , particularly in cologne , and then spread to france as the french electricity company edf tried to meet surging consumer needs , leading to what what bornard called a " house of cards " style breakdown .
parts of italy and spain also experienced power outages . in order to avoid a complete blackout , " automatic security systems sharply cut " supplies to some customers , he said , noting : " it all happened in several seconds . " the loss in power , which occurred around 10 p.m.
central european time , prompted a ripple effect in spanish power stations as facilities automatically shut down to protect them from power surges .
also affected was the connection between spain and morocco , a spokesperson for spanish power concern red electrica said sunday . the cross-border power wobble was also felt in belgium , where trains halted saturday between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. " luckily the power did n't fail at 5 p.m. on a friday evening , " a spokesperson for railway operator sncb said . the outages resulted in thousands of panicked calls to police and fire departments , but there did not appear to be any serious damages caused by the lack of power . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a new energy wave for europe in portugal the portuguese coast has become europe 's latest source of renewable energy .

this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .
many of them are located in low-lying coastal areas and have already experienced floods and droughts .
the second is that they have less economic power to cope with climate change .
so the convention recognizes this and is taking responsibility and trying to provide support to those countries which are vulnerable .
is technology really the answer because , surely , in the long-term none of these will really be able to stand up to the force that is climate change ?
yes , the convention recognized this and countries are making commitments to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit so that in future the stress on the climate will be reduced .

this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de living planet -pipe- 05.11.2006 interview : “ there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ” großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people need to adapt to the changes caused by global warming , such as increased flooding as changes in the climate become increasingly obvious , the international community has started devoting more attention to the idea of “ adaptation . ”
this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .
many of them are located in low-lying coastal areas and have already experienced floods and droughts .
the second is that they have less economic power to cope with climate change .
so the convention recognizes this and is taking responsibility and trying to provide support to those countries which are vulnerable .
is technology really the answer because , surely , in the long-term none of these will really be able to stand up to the force that is climate change ?
yes , the convention recognized this and countries are making commitments to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit so that in future the stress on the climate will be reduced .
in the long-term , mitigation should provide the answer and reducing those emissions is crucial .
so , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ?
yes , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done . anja kueppers interviewed florin vladu send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : combatting climate change living planet looks at innovative energy projects that reduce environmentally damaging greenhouse gases .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .
many of them are located in low-lying coastal areas and have already experienced floods and droughts .
the second is that they have less economic power to cope with climate change .
so the convention recognizes this and is taking responsibility and trying to provide support to those countries which are vulnerable .
is technology really the answer because , surely , in the long-term none of these will really be able to stand up to the force that is climate change ?
yes , the convention recognized this and countries are making commitments to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit so that in future the stress on the climate will be reduced .

dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .

klaus jacobs , who made a fortune in roasting and importing coffee , wants to set a precedent . german-born swiss billionaire klaus jacobs , 69 , best known for the coffee brand that bears his name , pledged a record donation of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- to a private university in his hometown of bremen .
it 's the largest single gift ever given to a german education institution . the donation , which will be made through a family foundation , involves a gift of 15 million euros per year for the next five years as well as a lump sum of 125 million euros in 2011 , and follows the announcement last month of three publicly funded " elite " universities in germany , which will be receiving 100 million euros each in government support . private donations are rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus jacobs made a fortune in the coffee roasting and import business since the university system is mainly publicly financed , private donations , which are common in britain and the united states , are rare in germany .
jacobs , who lives near cambridge , and is now chairman of adecco , the world 's largest temporary employment group , said he wants to set a philanthropic example to the german business community . " there 's enough money around .
the germans have lived 60 years in peace , and the country is rich , " jacobs told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" in switzerland , holland and belgium , not just in the english-speaking countries , businesses and private individuals are much more involved in supporting education … of course , there are exceptions such as the bosch foundation , but not much has happened since the end of the war . " university offers broad , english language curriculum the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , which was launched in 2001 as germany 's only private institution that offers a broad curriculum of arts , engineering and sciences in the english language , has an enrolment of over 1,000 students from 86 countries and will be renamed jacob university bremen . the university , however , will have a free hand in defining its academic priorities , jacobs said . three-quarters of the university 's student body is foreign , and iub maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio of ten-to-one , which is lower than other universities in germany . tuition is steep by german standards , ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 euros per year , with many students , in particular those from eastern europe , requiring scholarships and loans to cover the cost of studying at the iub . financial struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donations will enable private universities to attract the best scholars the university , which has yet to raise one-third of the 250 million euros in initial capital since its founding , has struggled financially .
competitive salaries are needed to keep the best professors , who are ready to bolt when they are offered tenured positions and state benefits at public universities , according to a commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " iub will now be able to reach that high level of quality that is indispensable for competing with the best schools worldwide , " said jacobs , who once studied at stanford university . jacobs , who has been oft criticized for trading his german passport for a swiss one , moved his family-owned coffee roasting and importing company to switzerland 33 years ago , and in 1990 , sold jacobs-suchard to the tobacco conglomerate philip morris , which in turn sold it to kraft foods inc . to the disappointment of the students , the university 's president , joachim treusch , said there will be no free jacobs coffee served on campus .

klaus jacobs , who made a fortune in roasting and importing coffee , wants to set a precedent . german-born swiss billionaire klaus jacobs , 69 , best known for the coffee brand that bears his name , pledged a record donation of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- to a private university in his hometown of bremen .
it 's the largest single gift ever given to a german education institution . the donation , which will be made through a family foundation , involves a gift of 15 million euros per year for the next five years as well as a lump sum of 125 million euros in 2011 , and follows the announcement last month of three publicly funded " elite " universities in germany , which will be receiving 100 million euros each in government support . private donations are rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus jacobs made a fortune in the coffee roasting and import business since the university system is mainly publicly financed , private donations , which are common in britain and the united states , are rare in germany .
jacobs , who lives near cambridge , and is now chairman of adecco , the world 's largest temporary employment group , said he wants to set a philanthropic example to the german business community . " there 's enough money around .
the germans have lived 60 years in peace , and the country is rich , " jacobs told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" in switzerland , holland and belgium , not just in the english-speaking countries , businesses and private individuals are much more involved in supporting education … of course , there are exceptions such as the bosch foundation , but not much has happened since the end of the war . " university offers broad , english language curriculum the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , which was launched in 2001 as germany 's only private institution that offers a broad curriculum of arts , engineering and sciences in the english language , has an enrolment of over 1,000 students from 86 countries and will be renamed jacob university bremen . the university , however , will have a free hand in defining its academic priorities , jacobs said . three-quarters of the university 's student body is foreign , and iub maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio of ten-to-one , which is lower than other universities in germany . tuition is steep by german standards , ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 euros per year , with many students , in particular those from eastern europe , requiring scholarships and loans to cover the cost of studying at the iub . financial struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donations will enable private universities to attract the best scholars the university , which has yet to raise one-third of the 250 million euros in initial capital since its founding , has struggled financially .
competitive salaries are needed to keep the best professors , who are ready to bolt when they are offered tenured positions and state benefits at public universities , according to a commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " iub will now be able to reach that high level of quality that is indispensable for competing with the best schools worldwide , " said jacobs , who once studied at stanford university . jacobs , who has been oft criticized for trading his german passport for a swiss one , moved his family-owned coffee roasting and importing company to switzerland 33 years ago , and in 1990 , sold jacobs-suchard to the tobacco conglomerate philip morris , which in turn sold it to kraft foods inc . to the disappointment of the students , the university 's president , joachim treusch , said there will be no free jacobs coffee served on campus . " well , we like jacobs coffee , but i do n't think that is a connection that in any way influences our academic development , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de corporate sponsors in the halls of german academia for germany 's cash-strapped state-run universities , naming a lecture hall after a corporate sponsor has become a source of private financing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de living planet -pipe- 05.11.2006 interview : “ there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ” großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people need to adapt to the changes caused by global warming , such as increased flooding as changes in the climate become increasingly obvious , the international community has started devoting more attention to the idea of “ adaptation . ”
this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .
many of them are located in low-lying coastal areas and have already experienced floods and droughts .
the second is that they have less economic power to cope with climate change .
so the convention recognizes this and is taking responsibility and trying to provide support to those countries which are vulnerable .
is technology really the answer because , surely , in the long-term none of these will really be able to stand up to the force that is climate change ?
yes , the convention recognized this and countries are making commitments to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit so that in future the stress on the climate will be reduced .
in the long-term , mitigation should provide the answer and reducing those emissions is crucial .
so , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ?
yes , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done . anja kueppers interviewed florin vladu send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : combatting climate change living planet looks at innovative energy projects that reduce environmentally damaging greenhouse gases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de living planet -pipe- 05.11.2006 interview : “ there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ” großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people need to adapt to the changes caused by global warming , such as increased flooding as changes in the climate become increasingly obvious , the international community has started devoting more attention to the idea of “ adaptation . ”
this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .
many of them are located in low-lying coastal areas and have already experienced floods and droughts .
the second is that they have less economic power to cope with climate change .
so the convention recognizes this and is taking responsibility and trying to provide support to those countries which are vulnerable .
is technology really the answer because , surely , in the long-term none of these will really be able to stand up to the force that is climate change ?
yes , the convention recognized this and countries are making commitments to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit so that in future the stress on the climate will be reduced .
in the long-term , mitigation should provide the answer and reducing those emissions is crucial .
so , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ?
yes , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done . anja kueppers interviewed florin vladu send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : combatting climate change living planet looks at innovative energy projects that reduce environmentally damaging greenhouse gases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de living planet -pipe- 05.11.2006 interview : “ there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ” großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people need to adapt to the changes caused by global warming , such as increased flooding as changes in the climate become increasingly obvious , the international community has started devoting more attention to the idea of “ adaptation . ”
this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .
many of them are located in low-lying coastal areas and have already experienced floods and droughts .
the second is that they have less economic power to cope with climate change .
so the convention recognizes this and is taking responsibility and trying to provide support to those countries which are vulnerable .
is technology really the answer because , surely , in the long-term none of these will really be able to stand up to the force that is climate change ?
yes , the convention recognized this and countries are making commitments to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit so that in future the stress on the climate will be reduced .
in the long-term , mitigation should provide the answer and reducing those emissions is crucial .
so , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ?
yes , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done . anja kueppers interviewed florin vladu send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : combatting climate change living planet looks at innovative energy projects that reduce environmentally damaging greenhouse gases .

klaus jacobs , who made a fortune in roasting and importing coffee , wants to set a precedent . german-born swiss billionaire klaus jacobs , 69 , best known for the coffee brand that bears his name , pledged a record donation of 200 million euros -lrb- $ 254 million -rrb- to a private university in his hometown of bremen .
it 's the largest single gift ever given to a german education institution . the donation , which will be made through a family foundation , involves a gift of 15 million euros per year for the next five years as well as a lump sum of 125 million euros in 2011 , and follows the announcement last month of three publicly funded " elite " universities in germany , which will be receiving 100 million euros each in government support . private donations are rare in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus jacobs made a fortune in the coffee roasting and import business since the university system is mainly publicly financed , private donations , which are common in britain and the united states , are rare in germany .
jacobs , who lives near cambridge , and is now chairman of adecco , the world 's largest temporary employment group , said he wants to set a philanthropic example to the german business community . " there 's enough money around .
the germans have lived 60 years in peace , and the country is rich , " jacobs told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" in switzerland , holland and belgium , not just in the english-speaking countries , businesses and private individuals are much more involved in supporting education … of course , there are exceptions such as the bosch foundation , but not much has happened since the end of the war . " university offers broad , english language curriculum the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , which was launched in 2001 as germany 's only private institution that offers a broad curriculum of arts , engineering and sciences in the english language , has an enrolment of over 1,000 students from 86 countries and will be renamed jacob university bremen . the university , however , will have a free hand in defining its academic priorities , jacobs said . three-quarters of the university 's student body is foreign , and iub maintains a low student-to-faculty ratio of ten-to-one , which is lower than other universities in germany . tuition is steep by german standards , ranging from 15,000 to 20,000 euros per year , with many students , in particular those from eastern europe , requiring scholarships and loans to cover the cost of studying at the iub . financial struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donations will enable private universities to attract the best scholars the university , which has yet to raise one-third of the 250 million euros in initial capital since its founding , has struggled financially .
competitive salaries are needed to keep the best professors , who are ready to bolt when they are offered tenured positions and state benefits at public universities , according to a commentary in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper . " iub will now be able to reach that high level of quality that is indispensable for competing with the best schools worldwide , " said jacobs , who once studied at stanford university . jacobs , who has been oft criticized for trading his german passport for a swiss one , moved his family-owned coffee roasting and importing company to switzerland 33 years ago , and in 1990 , sold jacobs-suchard to the tobacco conglomerate philip morris , which in turn sold it to kraft foods inc . to the disappointment of the students , the university 's president , joachim treusch , said there will be no free jacobs coffee served on campus .

this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .

this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .
many of them are located in low-lying coastal areas and have already experienced floods and droughts .
the second is that they have less economic power to cope with climate change .
so the convention recognizes this and is taking responsibility and trying to provide support to those countries which are vulnerable .
is technology really the answer because , surely , in the long-term none of these will really be able to stand up to the force that is climate change ?
yes , the convention recognized this and countries are making commitments to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit so that in future the stress on the climate will be reduced .
in the long-term , mitigation should provide the answer and reducing those emissions is crucial .

this means adjusting to the effects of climate change . some adaptation methods require social or political action .
others involve people having to adapt by changing their own behavior .
but most methods of adaptation will involve technology - both " hard " technology , such as building sea-walls and also " soft " technology , such as implementing crop rotation patterns .
the technology doesn ’ t need to be high-tech and expensive .
but it does have to start being implemented soon .
dw-radio talked to florin vladu , a program officer with the unfcc secretariat ’ s adaptation , technology and science program about adaptation .
dw-radio : how important is technology is in the battle against climate change ?
florin vladu : technology is important and it was always important .
technology was used for thousands of years to adapt to climate variability , such as to protect people from storms , floods , droughts and so on .
in the case of climate change , the issue is how to extend existing technologies to improve their capabilities so they will address the additional stress from climate change .
one has also to realize that technologies alone will not solve the problem .
it ’ s not only an issue of investing - of throwing money at some technologies - to solve the issue .
people have to change their way of doing things .
could you give an example of the different types of technologies that can be used ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small dyke separates these apartment buildings in rotterdam from the water the straightforward classification we have is hard technologies and soft technologies .
in hard technologies i would include , for example , irrigation technologies , seawalls , dykes .
and you can have also soft technologies such as teaching people how to rotate their crops .
and you can have technologies which involve both hard and soft technologies such as remote sensing with the satellite early-warning systems which will have both elements .
an interesting technology is the one to restore coral reefs with biorock .
this will involve constructing a kind of metal frame which is connected to a solar panel - this construction will stimulate the growth of coral .
so you can have a kind of artificial coral reef with this technology which is interesting .
do technologies have to be adapted specifically for different countries or are technologies being rolled out that can be used all around the world ?
technologies , of course , developed in one place could be used in other places but in the case of adaptation one has to be very , very careful .
it ’ s a common situation that these conditions are different from region to region so one has to consider existing technologies in other parts but with very careful consideration of conditions .
how difficult is it to introduce people to the concept of using technologies and to educate them how to do that ?
it ’ s an important element of our work because the beneficiaries of these technologies are mainly local communities .
and it is those people who are living very close to nature , so passing the message has to be done in a particular way , it has to be adapted to their capability of accessing information .
would you say that there is a risk of a divide developing between countries that can afford to implement the technologies and poorer countries that maybe left behind and yet are obviously as at risk of the effects of climate change ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is a particular problem for developing countries yes , i would say there is such a risk .
developing countries will be the most vulnerable to climate change from two points of view .
one is their geographical location .
many of them are located in low-lying coastal areas and have already experienced floods and droughts .
the second is that they have less economic power to cope with climate change .
so the convention recognizes this and is taking responsibility and trying to provide support to those countries which are vulnerable .
is technology really the answer because , surely , in the long-term none of these will really be able to stand up to the force that is climate change ?
yes , the convention recognized this and countries are making commitments to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they emit so that in future the stress on the climate will be reduced .
in the long-term , mitigation should provide the answer and reducing those emissions is crucial .
so , there ’ s still a lot of work to be done ?

" we were n't very far from a european blackout , " pierre bornard , a member of the board of directors of the french power company rte , told the afp news agency . the german energy company rwe said the trouble was due to a surge in demand late saturday when temperatures plummeted to the freezing point . " not enough power was being generated in the network , " a rwe spokesman said , adding that the outage became a pan-european incident because the supply was on a shared network . the spokesman also said a failure outside the company 's network was responsible for the outage . " initial findings indicate that the disturbance was due to excessive strain on the grid in northwestern germany , " e.on , germany 's biggest power supplier , said in a statement . blackout spread from germany # b # an insufficient power supply first triggered blackouts in parts of southern and western germany , particularly in cologne , and then spread to france as the french electricity company edf tried to meet surging consumer needs , leading to what what bornard called a " house of cards " style breakdown .
parts of italy and spain also experienced power outages . in order to avoid a complete blackout , " automatic security systems sharply cut " supplies to some customers , he said , noting : " it all happened in several seconds . " the loss in power , which occurred around 10 p.m.
central european time , prompted a ripple effect in spanish power stations as facilities automatically shut down to protect them from power surges .
also affected was the connection between spain and morocco , a spokesperson for spanish power concern red electrica said sunday . the cross-border power wobble was also felt in belgium , where trains halted saturday between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. " luckily the power did n't fail at 5 p.m. on a friday evening , " a spokesperson for railway operator sncb said . the outages resulted in thousands of panicked calls to police and fire departments , but there did not appear to be any serious damages caused by the lack of power . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a new energy wave for europe in portugal the portuguese coast has become europe 's latest source of renewable energy .

hilary benn said they had a very serious humanitarian impact and likened them to land mines , which were banned under international law in 1999 .
the comments by mr benn , who is hoping to succeed labour deputy leader john prescott , were in a letter to cabinet colleagues leaked to the sunday times .
a charity says 10,000 people have been killed or injured by cluster bombs .
a report by handicap international last week also claimed that civilians made up 98 % of the casualties , in 23 countries and regions including iraq , afghanistan and lebanon .
cluster munitions have a very serious humanitarian impact , pushing at the boundaries of international humanitarian law hilary benn international development secretary mr benn 's letter , which is in contrast to government policy , was sent to foreign secretary margaret beckett and defence secretary des browne , the sunday times reported .
in it he said : " the high failure rate of many cluster munitions , and the failure of many militaries around the world to use these munitions in a targeted way means that cluster munitions have a very serious humanitarian impact , pushing at the boundaries of international humanitarian law .
" it is difficult then to see how we can hold so prominent a position against landmines , yet somehow continue to advocate that use of cluster munitions is acceptable . "
the uk should lead the way in boycotting the weapons , he said , and ministers should call for a ban next week when attending a major international arms convention in new york .
us anti-ban " i believe we should go into the conference advocating for a process that will lead to an effective ban of 'dumb ' cluster munitions , " he added .
mr benn intends to run for labour 's deputy leadership current government policy is that cluster munitions play a " legitimate " role in modern warfare .
the unexploded artillery are considered to be effective in targeting airfields and bases .

the rac foundation has told bbc radio scotland 's the investigation programme that roadside drug testing equipment is already being used in australia and - if introduced in the uk - could save about 200 lives a year .
a recent study funded by the scottish executive estimated that one in 10 drivers in scotland drive under the influence of illegal drugs .
there are concerns that not enough is being done to tackle the problem .
the rac says that a drugs tester could save 200 lives a year shelia rainger from the rac foundation believes that the home office is delaying the introduction of a drugalyser .
she says : " we suspect part of the problem here is that there is a reluctance to talk about drug driving because it implies somehow that taking drugs might be okay providing that you are not going to get behind the wheel .
" we think this is nonsense and people are dying because of the reluctance of people to talk about this openly .
it is a taboo that needs to be broken . "
the investigation has learned from the home office that tests on drugalysers are still at an early stage .
they say it 'll be at least two more years before traffic police in the uk are issued with them .
on a recent friday night in glasgow , i interviewed a straw poll of drivers .
a lot of the young people who take drugs and drive do not see it as the same issue as drink driving , but it is just as bad chief inspector paul fleming many admitted to drug driving with one motorist saying : " yes i drug drive all the time after smoking dope .
it is 100 % safe , but to be fair i only go on the motorway . "
when asked if he drove after drinking alcohol , he said : " i drink and i have never got behind the wheel of a car because i know a pint in itself will have a lot more effect on me than a joint will . "
another clubber out in glasgow said : " a lot more people are a lot more conscious of jumping in a car if they have had a couple of drinks than if they have had a couple of joints . "
professor neil mckeganey , from the centre for drugs misuse research at glasgow university , told the investigation that his research revealed that many drug drivers do not think they will get caught .
let drivers go he added : " drug drivers are undoubtedly getting away with it .
people felt there was a small likelihood of getting discovered and even if they were stopped they did not think there was a strong likelihood of the police spotting they had used illegal drugs or having the technology readily to hand to determine whether that is the case . "
this was backed up by drug drivers interviewed for the programme who confirmed that they did not think they had a high chance of ever being caught by the police .
i discovered that the police are also becoming increasingly frustrated with current roadside field impairment tests which involve tasks like touching your nose and walking in a straight line to assess whether a driver is impaired by drugs .
while out on patrol with strathclyde road police , i learned that officers have no option to let drivers go if they pass field impairment tests - even if they strongly suspect the driving of having taken drugs .
many people do not believe taking drugs and driving is as bad as drink driving chief inspector paul fleming , the head of road policing specialist services at strathclyde police , believes that the fact that drug driving is not seen as socially unacceptable does not help the situation .

the rac foundation has told bbc radio scotland 's the investigation programme that roadside drug testing equipment is already being used in australia and - if introduced in the uk - could save about 200 lives a year .
a recent study funded by the scottish executive estimated that one in 10 drivers in scotland drive under the influence of illegal drugs .
there are concerns that not enough is being done to tackle the problem .
the rac says that a drugs tester could save 200 lives a year shelia rainger from the rac foundation believes that the home office is delaying the introduction of a drugalyser .
she says : " we suspect part of the problem here is that there is a reluctance to talk about drug driving because it implies somehow that taking drugs might be okay providing that you are not going to get behind the wheel .
" we think this is nonsense and people are dying because of the reluctance of people to talk about this openly .
it is a taboo that needs to be broken . "
the investigation has learned from the home office that tests on drugalysers are still at an early stage .
they say it 'll be at least two more years before traffic police in the uk are issued with them .
on a recent friday night in glasgow , i interviewed a straw poll of drivers .
a lot of the young people who take drugs and drive do not see it as the same issue as drink driving , but it is just as bad chief inspector paul fleming many admitted to drug driving with one motorist saying : " yes i drug drive all the time after smoking dope .
it is 100 % safe , but to be fair i only go on the motorway . "
when asked if he drove after drinking alcohol , he said : " i drink and i have never got behind the wheel of a car because i know a pint in itself will have a lot more effect on me than a joint will . "
another clubber out in glasgow said : " a lot more people are a lot more conscious of jumping in a car if they have had a couple of drinks than if they have had a couple of joints . "
professor neil mckeganey , from the centre for drugs misuse research at glasgow university , told the investigation that his research revealed that many drug drivers do not think they will get caught .
let drivers go he added : " drug drivers are undoubtedly getting away with it .
people felt there was a small likelihood of getting discovered and even if they were stopped they did not think there was a strong likelihood of the police spotting they had used illegal drugs or having the technology readily to hand to determine whether that is the case . "
this was backed up by drug drivers interviewed for the programme who confirmed that they did not think they had a high chance of ever being caught by the police .
i discovered that the police are also becoming increasingly frustrated with current roadside field impairment tests which involve tasks like touching your nose and walking in a straight line to assess whether a driver is impaired by drugs .
while out on patrol with strathclyde road police , i learned that officers have no option to let drivers go if they pass field impairment tests - even if they strongly suspect the driving of having taken drugs .
many people do not believe taking drugs and driving is as bad as drink driving chief inspector paul fleming , the head of road policing specialist services at strathclyde police , believes that the fact that drug driving is not seen as socially unacceptable does not help the situation .
he said : " a lot of the young people who take drugs and drive do not see it as the same issue as drink driving , but it is just as bad . "

if the vote is adopted as trust policy , hunts will be able to follow sick or injured deer on to their land to kill the animal .
trust members voted to allow hunting of stags at the holnicote estate , which forms much of exmoor .
the results at the annual general meeting in cheltenham were 12,768 in favour of the ban , 20,188 against .
' animal welfare ' sir william proby , trust chairman , said : " we are grateful to our members in making their views felt during an impassioned and helpful debate .
" the board of trustees will take the outcome of this debate into consideration in assessing the issue of exempt hunting , but our approach to deer management will continue to be driven first and foremost by practical considerations of animal welfare . "
protesters from the league against cruel sports gathered outside the meeting at the town 's racecourse in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade delegates to vote against allowing injured animals to be hunted .
the trust banned stag hunts about 10 years ago and hunting with dogs became illegal in 2005 .
the fox hunting season began on saturday , with thousands of enthusiasts setting out on foot and horseback following packs of hounds .

saddam hussein has given insurgents hope but saddam hussein himself seemed a little different - less tense , less angry , more aware of his ability to manipulate the atmosphere and produce the effect he required .
perhaps when the trial started he assumed it would be the kind of legal proceeding which had been followed when he was president , with the judge yelling insults at the accused .
this time , neatly dressed in a well-cut black suit and white shirt , he headed straight for his old chair in the dock and sat down .
when the presiding judge ordered him to stand , he refused .
" i will listen to the judgement , " he said , " but i will sit . "
in fact he did neither .
the judge ordered the ushers to make him stand up .
although he shouted at them to take their hands off him , he remained standing afterwards .
there has been talk that the sentence might be commuted for political reasons , but a majority of iraqis probably want him to die but directly the judge pronounced the words : " he should suffer the death penalty by hanging " , saddam started shouting at him , often raising his fist or pointing his finger , and once brandishing a copy of the koran in the air .
the judge did not pause .
he lowered his head and read the rest of the verdict in a louder voice , while saddam continued to shout at him .
surprised at brevity the other details of the verdict seemed bathetic : 10 years ' imprisonment for forcibly displacing people , 10 years for torture as a crime against humanity .
unnecessarily , the judge said the highest penalty would be imposed .
the verdict , he said , had been unanimous among his four colleagues , sitting beside him out of the limelight .
many iraqis still feel a little dazed by the sight of their former leader in the dock and that was almost that .
perhaps saddam hussein himself was taken by surprise at the brevity of the proceedings .
there was a pause , then he shouted out " long live iraq !
long live the iraqi people ! "
these interjections of his have had an electrifying effect on his supporters in the iraqi insurgency , and perhaps he knows that .
times changed many iraqis still feel a little dazed by the sight of their former leader in the dock .
in the past , you could be killed in a bath of acid for insulting the president .
i have met a man sentenced to death in that way for writing a phone number on a banknote with saddam 's face on it .
his prospective executioners listened to his story , sympathised with him , and merely dipped him in the bath for a few seconds .
he had some of the most hideous scars i have ever seen .
now saddam himself faces death by hanging .
there has been talk that the sentence might be commuted for political reasons , but a majority of iraqis probably want him to die .
but in a way saddam has achieved a good deal .
he has given new heart to his supporters and to the insurgency since the appeal process will be swift , and the constitution dictates that the sentence must be carried out within 30 days of the appeal 's rejection , the execution could take place within the next few months .
but in a way saddam has achieved a good deal .
he has given new heart to his supporters and to the insurgency .
he has made up for the humiliation of being pulled , dirty and dishevelled , from a hole in the ground .
and he has put his own stamp on the proceedings , from start to finish .
as he was escorted out of the courtroom today , i was standing only a couple of feet from him , in the press-box .
i watched a small smile pass across his face .
he had achieved precisely what he had come to the courtroom to do .

saddam hussein has given insurgents hope but saddam hussein himself seemed a little different - less tense , less angry , more aware of his ability to manipulate the atmosphere and produce the effect he required .
perhaps when the trial started he assumed it would be the kind of legal proceeding which had been followed when he was president , with the judge yelling insults at the accused .
this time , neatly dressed in a well-cut black suit and white shirt , he headed straight for his old chair in the dock and sat down .
when the presiding judge ordered him to stand , he refused .
" i will listen to the judgement , " he said , " but i will sit . "
in fact he did neither .
the judge ordered the ushers to make him stand up .
although he shouted at them to take their hands off him , he remained standing afterwards .
there has been talk that the sentence might be commuted for political reasons , but a majority of iraqis probably want him to die but directly the judge pronounced the words : " he should suffer the death penalty by hanging " , saddam started shouting at him , often raising his fist or pointing his finger , and once brandishing a copy of the koran in the air .
the judge did not pause .
he lowered his head and read the rest of the verdict in a louder voice , while saddam continued to shout at him .
surprised at brevity the other details of the verdict seemed bathetic : 10 years ' imprisonment for forcibly displacing people , 10 years for torture as a crime against humanity .
unnecessarily , the judge said the highest penalty would be imposed .
the verdict , he said , had been unanimous among his four colleagues , sitting beside him out of the limelight .
many iraqis still feel a little dazed by the sight of their former leader in the dock and that was almost that .
perhaps saddam hussein himself was taken by surprise at the brevity of the proceedings .
there was a pause , then he shouted out " long live iraq !
long live the iraqi people ! "
these interjections of his have had an electrifying effect on his supporters in the iraqi insurgency , and perhaps he knows that .
times changed many iraqis still feel a little dazed by the sight of their former leader in the dock .
in the past , you could be killed in a bath of acid for insulting the president .
i have met a man sentenced to death in that way for writing a phone number on a banknote with saddam 's face on it .
his prospective executioners listened to his story , sympathised with him , and merely dipped him in the bath for a few seconds .
he had some of the most hideous scars i have ever seen .
now saddam himself faces death by hanging .
there has been talk that the sentence might be commuted for political reasons , but a majority of iraqis probably want him to die .
but in a way saddam has achieved a good deal .
he has given new heart to his supporters and to the insurgency since the appeal process will be swift , and the constitution dictates that the sentence must be carried out within 30 days of the appeal 's rejection , the execution could take place within the next few months .
but in a way saddam has achieved a good deal .
he has given new heart to his supporters and to the insurgency .
he has made up for the humiliation of being pulled , dirty and dishevelled , from a hole in the ground .
and he has put his own stamp on the proceedings , from start to finish .
as he was escorted out of the courtroom today , i was standing only a couple of feet from him , in the press-box .
i watched a small smile pass across his face .
he had achieved precisely what he had come to the courtroom to do .

physics especially suffered , the lords science and technology committee said .
the problem was compounded by school league tables , " teaching to the test " , poor labs , misplaced health and safety fears and a shortage of teachers .
the peers urged a broadening of the a-level curriculum , as in wales .
the government said it was already taking action to address many of the issues .
on friday the prime minister stressed the importance he attached to science and urged youngsters to consider it as a career .
in its report , science teaching in schools , the lords committee noted a general decline in the popularity of science and mathematics a-levels over the last decade , though with an upturn in some subjects in the past couple of years .
difficulty one factor was simply fashion - with new options such as psychology , media studies and photography , which one witness to the committee said young people called " funky subjects " .
for example , 50,000 students took psychology a-level in 2005 , " significantly more than sat physics or chemistry " .
a more serious and fundamental problem was that traditional science subjects and maths were regarded as more difficult .
not only that , there was evidence they actually were harder , the peers said .
the response from the department for education and skills and the qualifications and curriculum authority , that all a-levels were given equal weight , was " unconvincing " .
" the institute of physics reported anecdotal evidence of schools ' actively discouraging students from taking subjects that could weaken their league table position ' through lower a-level grades . "
the committee urged the government to revisit the recommendations of the tomlinson report , on having a range of diplomas to replace gcses and a-levels .
its chairman , lord broers , said : " we call on the government to look again at a diploma or baccalaureate system , which would enable students to keep studying science and maths along with other subjects , reducing the tendency for them to drop science entirely for ' easier ' subjects after their gcses .
" the welsh assembly government has recognised the need to broaden post-16 education - the westminster government needs to catch up . "
the report also expressed concern that the new " light touch " ofsted inspections would mean there would be no future evidence base on the quality of science teaching in schools .
the stress on test results in schools prompted concern about " a culture of teaching to the test " , pushing teachers into " narrow and uninspiring methods of teaching " .
facilities the committee deplored the government 's failure to keep its 2005 election pledge to invest £ 200m in improving school science laboratories .
even where facilities had been upgraded there was evidence that they were of low quality .
witnesses had also reported " ill-informed " worries about health and safety in regard to science experiments and a " very real fear of litigation " if something went wrong .
although the recruitment of teachers to shortage subjects had improved in recent years in response to government initiatives , the scale of vacancies in science and mathematics was " a major concern " .
there also needed to be better ongoing training for science teachers , and a better career structure and rewards for lab technicians .
the department for education and skills said increasing the number of scientists was a priority for the government , which was already making " significant progress " on delivering the actions being called for .
" we have been working across government with employers , schools and experts in the field to both improve the quality of science teaching and make science a more attractive option , " a spokesman said .
" it is this joint working that will ensure we deliver the scientists of the future . "

physics especially suffered , the lords science and technology committee said .
the problem was compounded by school league tables , " teaching to the test " , poor labs , misplaced health and safety fears and a shortage of teachers .
the peers urged a broadening of the a-level curriculum , as in wales .
the government said it was already taking action to address many of the issues .
on friday the prime minister stressed the importance he attached to science and urged youngsters to consider it as a career .
in its report , science teaching in schools , the lords committee noted a general decline in the popularity of science and mathematics a-levels over the last decade , though with an upturn in some subjects in the past couple of years .
difficulty one factor was simply fashion - with new options such as psychology , media studies and photography , which one witness to the committee said young people called " funky subjects " .
for example , 50,000 students took psychology a-level in 2005 , " significantly more than sat physics or chemistry " .
a more serious and fundamental problem was that traditional science subjects and maths were regarded as more difficult .
not only that , there was evidence they actually were harder , the peers said .
the response from the department for education and skills and the qualifications and curriculum authority , that all a-levels were given equal weight , was " unconvincing " .
" the institute of physics reported anecdotal evidence of schools ' actively discouraging students from taking subjects that could weaken their league table position ' through lower a-level grades . "
the committee urged the government to revisit the recommendations of the tomlinson report , on having a range of diplomas to replace gcses and a-levels .
its chairman , lord broers , said : " we call on the government to look again at a diploma or baccalaureate system , which would enable students to keep studying science and maths along with other subjects , reducing the tendency for them to drop science entirely for ' easier ' subjects after their gcses .
" the welsh assembly government has recognised the need to broaden post-16 education - the westminster government needs to catch up . "
the report also expressed concern that the new " light touch " ofsted inspections would mean there would be no future evidence base on the quality of science teaching in schools .
the stress on test results in schools prompted concern about " a culture of teaching to the test " , pushing teachers into " narrow and uninspiring methods of teaching " .
facilities the committee deplored the government 's failure to keep its 2005 election pledge to invest £ 200m in improving school science laboratories .
even where facilities had been upgraded there was evidence that they were of low quality .
witnesses had also reported " ill-informed " worries about health and safety in regard to science experiments and a " very real fear of litigation " if something went wrong .

physics especially suffered , the lords science and technology committee said .
the problem was compounded by school league tables , " teaching to the test " , poor labs , misplaced health and safety fears and a shortage of teachers .
the peers urged a broadening of the a-level curriculum , as in wales .
the government said it was already taking action to address many of the issues .
on friday the prime minister stressed the importance he attached to science and urged youngsters to consider it as a career .
in its report , science teaching in schools , the lords committee noted a general decline in the popularity of science and mathematics a-levels over the last decade , though with an upturn in some subjects in the past couple of years .
difficulty one factor was simply fashion - with new options such as psychology , media studies and photography , which one witness to the committee said young people called " funky subjects " .
for example , 50,000 students took psychology a-level in 2005 , " significantly more than sat physics or chemistry " .
a more serious and fundamental problem was that traditional science subjects and maths were regarded as more difficult .
not only that , there was evidence they actually were harder , the peers said .
the response from the department for education and skills and the qualifications and curriculum authority , that all a-levels were given equal weight , was " unconvincing " .
" the institute of physics reported anecdotal evidence of schools ' actively discouraging students from taking subjects that could weaken their league table position ' through lower a-level grades . "
the committee urged the government to revisit the recommendations of the tomlinson report , on having a range of diplomas to replace gcses and a-levels .
its chairman , lord broers , said : " we call on the government to look again at a diploma or baccalaureate system , which would enable students to keep studying science and maths along with other subjects , reducing the tendency for them to drop science entirely for ' easier ' subjects after their gcses .
" the welsh assembly government has recognised the need to broaden post-16 education - the westminster government needs to catch up . "
the report also expressed concern that the new " light touch " ofsted inspections would mean there would be no future evidence base on the quality of science teaching in schools .
