to walk into any german boardroom , high level political meeting or even news conference is to walk into a room filled mainly with men . then last year , angela merkel became germany 's first female chancellor and people mused over whether this might be a turning point for women in germany .
another first - the appointment of monika harms as the first female federal prosecutor general on tuesday - is making it look that way . " i think that i provide an example that women can also reach the highest offices , " she said 19 years ago after being appointed to the federal court of justice , the country 's highest appellate court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel started out as ' kohl 's girl ' , but managed to elbow her way to the top a long way up born in 1946 in berlin , harms grew up in frankfurt am main and studied in heidelberg and hamburg .
she started her judicial career in 1974 as a prosecutor in hamburg , responsible for corporate crime .
afterward , she worked as a judge at the district court level and later at hamburg 's fiscal court before being appointed to the federal court of justice . a self-described conservative , harms has been described by her colleagues as a team player known for her integrity and a pragmatic approach to problem-solving .
and although she is a member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , she has never been known as a party hack . harms was considered a favorite candidate for the federal constitutional court , which will have two vacancies this year .

the statistics do n't look good . the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent .
and a 2006 report on equality by the european commission showed that the wage gap between men and women in germany widened by three percentage points in the past five years - german men earned on average 23 percent more income than women for equal work in 2004 . still , in the realm of politics and law , women have done better since german chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt to his cabinet in 1961 .
schröder had six women in his cabinet , merkel has five .
and women make up about one-third of parliament , up from 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equal opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s - especially a quota introduced by the greens reserving 50 percent of party seats and posts for women . still , most agree that as more and more women climb the ladder , society will get used to seeing them in top posts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.05.2006 first female appointed as germany 's top lawyer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monika harms will lead a boys ' club in a country in which most top political and business posts are held by men , the appointment of monika harms as federal prosecutor general on tuesday has people wondering if things are changing for women . it has become almost cliché .
to walk into any german boardroom , high level political meeting or even news conference is to walk into a room filled mainly with men . then last year , angela merkel became germany 's first female chancellor and people mused over whether this might be a turning point for women in germany .
another first - the appointment of monika harms as the first female federal prosecutor general on tuesday - is making it look that way . " i think that i provide an example that women can also reach the highest offices , " she said 19 years ago after being appointed to the federal court of justice , the country 's highest appellate court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel started out as ' kohl 's girl ' , but managed to elbow her way to the top a long way up born in 1946 in berlin , harms grew up in frankfurt am main and studied in heidelberg and hamburg .
she started her judicial career in 1974 as a prosecutor in hamburg , responsible for corporate crime .
afterward , she worked as a judge at the district court level and later at hamburg 's fiscal court before being appointed to the federal court of justice . a self-described conservative , harms has been described by her colleagues as a team player known for her integrity and a pragmatic approach to problem-solving .
and although she is a member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , she has never been known as a party hack . harms was considered a favorite candidate for the federal constitutional court , which will have two vacancies this year .
but she let it be known that she would rather have the top prosecutor job .
there , she will enter a boys ' club - following her predecessor kay nehm , who retired this week and who led a team that , for the last decade , has consisted of about 25 men . hope for others ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military and politics have opened to women - but boardrooms are largely closed but it 's doubtful whether harms ' appointment will signal a change in germany for women seeking to break through the glass ceiling .
the statistics do n't look good . the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent .
and a 2006 report on equality by the european commission showed that the wage gap between men and women in germany widened by three percentage points in the past five years - german men earned on average 23 percent more income than women for equal work in 2004 . still , in the realm of politics and law , women have done better since german chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt to his cabinet in 1961 .
schröder had six women in his cabinet , merkel has five .
and women make up about one-third of parliament , up from 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equal opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s - especially a quota introduced by the greens reserving 50 percent of party seats and posts for women . still , most agree that as more and more women climb the ladder , society will get used to seeing them in top posts .
and in that , harms provides another high profile example . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wage gap between the sexes widens in germany elsewhere in europe , the gap between salaries earned by men and women for the same work has been narrowing , but the reverse is the case in germany .
here , men take home on average 23 percent more pay than women .

" the german economy appears to be in a position where it could now realize a shift from a regime where demand tended to undershoot supply to one in which more expansionary supply conditions and resulting improved growth prospects feed through into more buoyant demand , " the organization for economic cooperation and development wrote in a special report on germany released on tuesday . " the challenge in this context is to make improvements in a variety of areas - long-term growth , employment creation , public finance sustainability - while at the same time preserving what could well be a genuine recovery in short-run activity extending beyond the export sector , " the report found . the oecd is penciling in gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.8 percent for germany this year and growth of 1.6 percent next year .
unadjusted for the differing number of working days , german gdp was projected to expand by 1.6 percent in 2006 and by 1.5 percent in 2007 , the organization said . the german government , for its part , is penciling in growth of 1.6 percent this year and just 1.0 percent next year .
more work ahead " despite courageous reforms , a lot remains to be done to reduce unemployment and boost employment creation , " the oecd said .
it said that the hurdles " to labor force participation of older employees and females need to be further reduced . "
it continued : " more flexible employment contracts are necessary .
wage rigidities need to be reduced further to fight very high unemployment rates among the low-qualified . " the oecd also said that the education system needed to become more effective .
universities should be funded according to performance and incentives made for universities to raise research performance and improve teaching quality on a broader and more sustained basis . finally , in the area of public finances , the oecd found that " a credible consolidation policy is needed that links expenditure control with public sector reform covering federal fiscal relations , removing distortions in the tax system and making the key government services more efficient .

it essentially allows companies in one member state to compete in others without conforming to local bureaucracy .
for some , the legislation was cause for celebration . " it 's a real breakthrough , " said martin bartenstein , austria 's finance minister , adding that the deal would create " hundreds of thousands " of jobs . " the door is open for more growth and competition in the services sector , " german junior minister joachim wuermeling told reporters .
" the eu has shown its ability to act in the most difficult dossier in recent years . " the accord on the new services sector legislation followed nearly nine hours of negotiations on a compromise text drawn up by the eu 's austrian presidency . in the end , all the eu countries finally approved the text , except for lithuania which abstained .
its finance minister said vilnius was looking for " a more profound european integration . " compromise is everything the compromise agreement is a heavily revised version of the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former competition commissioner , frits bolkestein of the netherlands . in its original form the directive proposed that companies offering services as diverse as catering , software and plumbing in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beefy polish plumber featured on a tourism ad became a symbol for unwanted cheap labor but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations - in particular in eastern europe - would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . opponents warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform . in february , the european parliament threw out the original version and presented its own text , which saw the controversial " country of origin " principle replaced with a general rule stating that member states can not discriminate against foreign service providers who are free to trade their business across europe .
in april the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version . it was this draft , in slightly modified form , which was agreed by the bloc on monday . bartenstein said the bloc had avoided the pitfalls of the bolkestein debate . " we were able to avoid a split between the old and new member states , " he said . france , which was one of the most vocal critics of the original proposal , agreed to the modified legislation after it was decided the new rules would be introduced over three years instead of the usual two for eu measures . health care , social services , port services , television and radio , temporary employment agencies and casinos are excluded from the deal . final approval in december bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament is expected to pass the new legislation the bill goes back to the european parliament for a final reading in december .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .
confronting it should not only be a police task .
it 's a question of mentality in the population .
above all , this kind of brutal ultra-right radicalism is boosted by negligent and demagogic statements by politicians .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .
confronting it should not only be a police task .
it 's a question of mentality in the population .
above all , this kind of brutal ultra-right radicalism is boosted by negligent and demagogic statements by politicians .
when -lrb- bavarian prime minister -rrb- stoiber warns , for example , of the racial dilution of the german people , he is using the kind of vocabulary that validates right-wing violence . mohammed masaad interviewed günter grass -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting literary freedom in germany pen members are meeting in berlin this week to promote literature and freedom of expression .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 30.05.2006 germany welcomes the walking wounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another one bites the dust : lionel messi pays the price for barcelona 's hectic schedule the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .
could the amount of games played in a season threaten the prestige of future cups ?
would a compulsory winter break ensure more stars are fit ? it would be a coach 's dream to field such a team : portugal 's jorge andrade marshalling the defense with germany 's robert huth beside him and compatriot philipp lahm speeding up the wing from left back ; england 's ledley king ahead of the back four feeding a midfield featuring australia 's harry kewell , argentinean prodigy lionel messi and team captain michael ballack . the attacking force of italy 's christian vieri and england 's striking duo michael owen and wayne rooney would complete the world class line-up . unfortunately , for the international coaches who count these players as integral members of their squads , it is currently more of a nightmare .
because these stars , who would light up any team and were due to shine for their countries at the world cup in germany , are either out of the tournament through injury or are facing a race against time to get fit before it begins on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal : wayne broke his foot again andrade , vieri and king will definitely not be there this summer .
rooney , messi and kewell are all sweating over medical results which could rule them out of the tournament while ballack , huth and lahm - crocked in post season warm-ups - are expected to recover from their minor injuries in time .
michael owen has yet to play a full game since breaking his foot on jan .
1 . world cup at the mercy of modern soccer the world cup 's positioning in the soccer calendar exposes it to the modern game 's injury curse .
coming in the summer after a full domestic and european itinerary , interspersed with international qualifying games and friendlies , the world cup finds itself at the mercy of an increasingly strenuous schedule .
soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .
the liverpool captain has already played 62 games in a season which began for him in july 2005 .
if england reach the world cup final on july 9 and gerrard features in all of their games in germany , he will have played in 71 matches . while not as dangerous as more obvious contact sports such as american football and rugby , soccer still has one of the highest rates of athlete injury ; a rate many experts associate with the amount of games players are expected to take part in . risk of injury increases with number of games played bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more you play , the greater the risk medical studies have shown that injuries are more likely to take place during competitive matches than in practice and training sessions .
a recent study carried out by the american journal of sports medicine showed that the rate of injuries in soccer games was 16.9 injuries per 1000 hours , while the rate of injuries in practice was 7.6 per 1000 hours . for gerrard and other england-based stars , the huge number of games played in the pursuit of major domestic , european and international trophies increases the likelihood of an injury being sustained .
as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .
german clubs suffer from fewer long-term injuries heading towards the finish line than at any stage of the season .
at the same time , english clubs , which have no mid-season break , have more serious injuries at the end of the campaign than at any other period in the calendar . mid-season break results in fewer long-term injuries the mid-season break means bundesliga clubs start the season again in january with rested players after a period of time where those injured before christmas have had sufficient time to recover . this means the number of players missing through long-term injuries dramatically dips just when all the major trophies are being handed out in may . while the effects of a mid-season break are evident at the end of the campaign in the form of the number of players from the bundesliga being fit in comparison to those playing elsewhere in europe , results also show a break benefits teams later in the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham played despite an injury at the 2002 world cup in september 2001 , england beat germany 5-1 in munich in a qualifier for the 2002 tournament .
come the world cup itself in japan / korea the following june , england limped out of the championship in the quarter-final after having to leave a number of star players at home injured and playing an unfit david beckham throughout .
germany progressed to the final where they were narrowly beaten by england 's conquerors brazil . help future world cups ; reduce players ' workload in reality , it would take a lot to diminish the world cup .
it would take an injury wave of pandemic proportions to wipe out enough players to make a dent in the tournament 's prestige . but as the globe 's pre-eminent soccer championship , the world cup requires the best players in the game to be there .
surely a reduction in the number of matches played in leagues where there is no mid-season break would not only be beneficial for the players but for the game as a whole . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's richest soccer clubs sue fifa over players ' use the g14 group of europe 's 18 most powerful soccer clubs have launched a bid to sue fifa for 860 million euros -lrb- $ 1,000 million -rrb- over what it sees as the unlawful use of club players in national teams .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 30.05.2006 germany welcomes the walking wounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another one bites the dust : lionel messi pays the price for barcelona 's hectic schedule the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .
could the amount of games played in a season threaten the prestige of future cups ?
would a compulsory winter break ensure more stars are fit ? it would be a coach 's dream to field such a team : portugal 's jorge andrade marshalling the defense with germany 's robert huth beside him and compatriot philipp lahm speeding up the wing from left back ; england 's ledley king ahead of the back four feeding a midfield featuring australia 's harry kewell , argentinean prodigy lionel messi and team captain michael ballack . the attacking force of italy 's christian vieri and england 's striking duo michael owen and wayne rooney would complete the world class line-up . unfortunately , for the international coaches who count these players as integral members of their squads , it is currently more of a nightmare .
because these stars , who would light up any team and were due to shine for their countries at the world cup in germany , are either out of the tournament through injury or are facing a race against time to get fit before it begins on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal : wayne broke his foot again andrade , vieri and king will definitely not be there this summer .
rooney , messi and kewell are all sweating over medical results which could rule them out of the tournament while ballack , huth and lahm - crocked in post season warm-ups - are expected to recover from their minor injuries in time .
michael owen has yet to play a full game since breaking his foot on jan .
1 . world cup at the mercy of modern soccer the world cup 's positioning in the soccer calendar exposes it to the modern game 's injury curse .
coming in the summer after a full domestic and european itinerary , interspersed with international qualifying games and friendlies , the world cup finds itself at the mercy of an increasingly strenuous schedule .
soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .
the liverpool captain has already played 62 games in a season which began for him in july 2005 .
if england reach the world cup final on july 9 and gerrard features in all of their games in germany , he will have played in 71 matches . while not as dangerous as more obvious contact sports such as american football and rugby , soccer still has one of the highest rates of athlete injury ; a rate many experts associate with the amount of games players are expected to take part in . risk of injury increases with number of games played bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more you play , the greater the risk medical studies have shown that injuries are more likely to take place during competitive matches than in practice and training sessions .
a recent study carried out by the american journal of sports medicine showed that the rate of injuries in soccer games was 16.9 injuries per 1000 hours , while the rate of injuries in practice was 7.6 per 1000 hours . for gerrard and other england-based stars , the huge number of games played in the pursuit of major domestic , european and international trophies increases the likelihood of an injury being sustained .
as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .
german clubs suffer from fewer long-term injuries heading towards the finish line than at any stage of the season .
at the same time , english clubs , which have no mid-season break , have more serious injuries at the end of the campaign than at any other period in the calendar . mid-season break results in fewer long-term injuries the mid-season break means bundesliga clubs start the season again in january with rested players after a period of time where those injured before christmas have had sufficient time to recover . this means the number of players missing through long-term injuries dramatically dips just when all the major trophies are being handed out in may . while the effects of a mid-season break are evident at the end of the campaign in the form of the number of players from the bundesliga being fit in comparison to those playing elsewhere in europe , results also show a break benefits teams later in the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham played despite an injury at the 2002 world cup in september 2001 , england beat germany 5-1 in munich in a qualifier for the 2002 tournament .
come the world cup itself in japan / korea the following june , england limped out of the championship in the quarter-final after having to leave a number of star players at home injured and playing an unfit david beckham throughout .
germany progressed to the final where they were narrowly beaten by england 's conquerors brazil . help future world cups ; reduce players ' workload in reality , it would take a lot to diminish the world cup .
it would take an injury wave of pandemic proportions to wipe out enough players to make a dent in the tournament 's prestige . but as the globe 's pre-eminent soccer championship , the world cup requires the best players in the game to be there .
surely a reduction in the number of matches played in leagues where there is no mid-season break would not only be beneficial for the players but for the game as a whole . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's richest soccer clubs sue fifa over players ' use the g14 group of europe 's 18 most powerful soccer clubs have launched a bid to sue fifa for 860 million euros -lrb- $ 1,000 million -rrb- over what it sees as the unlawful use of club players in national teams .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .
confronting it should not only be a police task .
it 's a question of mentality in the population .
above all , this kind of brutal ultra-right radicalism is boosted by negligent and demagogic statements by politicians .
when -lrb- bavarian prime minister -rrb- stoiber warns , for example , of the racial dilution of the german people , he is using the kind of vocabulary that validates right-wing violence . mohammed masaad interviewed günter grass -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting literary freedom in germany pen members are meeting in berlin this week to promote literature and freedom of expression .

1 . world cup at the mercy of modern soccer the world cup 's positioning in the soccer calendar exposes it to the modern game 's injury curse .
coming in the summer after a full domestic and european itinerary , interspersed with international qualifying games and friendlies , the world cup finds itself at the mercy of an increasingly strenuous schedule .
soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .
the liverpool captain has already played 62 games in a season which began for him in july 2005 .
if england reach the world cup final on july 9 and gerrard features in all of their games in germany , he will have played in 71 matches . while not as dangerous as more obvious contact sports such as american football and rugby , soccer still has one of the highest rates of athlete injury ; a rate many experts associate with the amount of games players are expected to take part in . risk of injury increases with number of games played bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more you play , the greater the risk medical studies have shown that injuries are more likely to take place during competitive matches than in practice and training sessions .
a recent study carried out by the american journal of sports medicine showed that the rate of injuries in soccer games was 16.9 injuries per 1000 hours , while the rate of injuries in practice was 7.6 per 1000 hours . for gerrard and other england-based stars , the huge number of games played in the pursuit of major domestic , european and international trophies increases the likelihood of an injury being sustained .
as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .
german clubs suffer from fewer long-term injuries heading towards the finish line than at any stage of the season .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .
confronting it should not only be a police task .
it 's a question of mentality in the population .
above all , this kind of brutal ultra-right radicalism is boosted by negligent and demagogic statements by politicians .
when -lrb- bavarian prime minister -rrb- stoiber warns , for example , of the racial dilution of the german people , he is using the kind of vocabulary that validates right-wing violence . mohammed masaad interviewed günter grass -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting literary freedom in germany pen members are meeting in berlin this week to promote literature and freedom of expression .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .

naohiro takahara - who is set to move from his current club , sv hamburg , to eintracht frankfurt - had put asian champions japan two goals up with a brace - in the 57th and 65th minute - inside eight minutes . germany appeared to be on their way to their second home defeat in the two-year reign of manager jürgen klinsmann but hit back late on .
miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect . " one could tell that we 're in the middle of preparing , " said germany captain michael ballack .
" the japanese were more lively .
we had heavy legs , but that 's normal .
the important thing is that we came back again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals to his credit , takahara -lrb- r . -rrb- was japan 's star japan , quarter-finalists at the 2002 world cup , open their world cup campaign game against australia in kaiserslautern on june 12 . klinsmann fielded his strongest team with ballack shrugging off an ankle injury to return on the ground where he made his name with bayer leverkusen .
ballack showed no sign of struggling and was behind most of germany 's best moves early on as the hosts had a succession of corners but could not make any count . japan takes lead but japan had the first opening on the quarter hour mark .
germany were carved open down the left and bolton midfielder hidetoshi nakata forced a brilliant point blank save from goalkeeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later lehmann was called into action again as striker atsushi yanagisawa raced through on goal but hit the ball straight at the arsenal goalkeeper . going forward germany were far more polished and in the 24th minute ballack had a goal-bound shot deflected wide .
lukas podolski then went close with a shot at the near post , though he may have been better playing the ball square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski -lrb- r . -rrb- helped save germany in the 54th minute japan produced the best move of the match with three first time passes releasing yuji nakazawa , but his shot was blocked by marcell jansen .
but three minutes later the breakthrough arrived with takahara finishing a great move by rifling past lehmann .
takahara doubled his tally , and that of his team , eight minutes later with a great swivel turn and thumped a shot past lehmann . klose and schweinsteiger then sealed the german comeback and both sides could have won it in the closing stages . germany face colombia in mönchengladbach on friday for their final warm-up match while japan take on malta in düsseldorf on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

naohiro takahara - who is set to move from his current club , sv hamburg , to eintracht frankfurt - had put asian champions japan two goals up with a brace - in the 57th and 65th minute - inside eight minutes . germany appeared to be on their way to their second home defeat in the two-year reign of manager jürgen klinsmann but hit back late on .
miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect . " one could tell that we 're in the middle of preparing , " said germany captain michael ballack .
" the japanese were more lively .
we had heavy legs , but that 's normal .

ballack showed no sign of struggling and was behind most of germany 's best moves early on as the hosts had a succession of corners but could not make any count . japan takes lead but japan had the first opening on the quarter hour mark .
germany were carved open down the left and bolton midfielder hidetoshi nakata forced a brilliant point blank save from goalkeeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later lehmann was called into action again as striker atsushi yanagisawa raced through on goal but hit the ball straight at the arsenal goalkeeper . going forward germany were far more polished and in the 24th minute ballack had a goal-bound shot deflected wide .
lukas podolski then went close with a shot at the near post , though he may have been better playing the ball square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski -lrb- r . -rrb- helped save germany in the 54th minute japan produced the best move of the match with three first time passes releasing yuji nakazawa , but his shot was blocked by marcell jansen .
but three minutes later the breakthrough arrived with takahara finishing a great move by rifling past lehmann .
takahara doubled his tally , and that of his team , eight minutes later with a great swivel turn and thumped a shot past lehmann . klose and schweinsteiger then sealed the german comeback and both sides could have won it in the closing stages . germany face colombia in mönchengladbach on friday for their final warm-up match while japan take on malta in düsseldorf on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

" the german economy appears to be in a position where it could now realize a shift from a regime where demand tended to undershoot supply to one in which more expansionary supply conditions and resulting improved growth prospects feed through into more buoyant demand , " the organization for economic cooperation and development wrote in a special report on germany released on tuesday . " the challenge in this context is to make improvements in a variety of areas - long-term growth , employment creation , public finance sustainability - while at the same time preserving what could well be a genuine recovery in short-run activity extending beyond the export sector , " the report found . the oecd is penciling in gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.8 percent for germany this year and growth of 1.6 percent next year .
unadjusted for the differing number of working days , german gdp was projected to expand by 1.6 percent in 2006 and by 1.5 percent in 2007 , the organization said . the german government , for its part , is penciling in growth of 1.6 percent this year and just 1.0 percent next year .
more work ahead " despite courageous reforms , a lot remains to be done to reduce unemployment and boost employment creation , " the oecd said .
it said that the hurdles " to labor force participation of older employees and females need to be further reduced . "
it continued : " more flexible employment contracts are necessary .
wage rigidities need to be reduced further to fight very high unemployment rates among the low-qualified . " the oecd also said that the education system needed to become more effective .
universities should be funded according to performance and incentives made for universities to raise research performance and improve teaching quality on a broader and more sustained basis . finally , in the area of public finances , the oecd found that " a credible consolidation policy is needed that links expenditure control with public sector reform covering federal fiscal relations , removing distortions in the tax system and making the key government services more efficient .

naohiro takahara - who is set to move from his current club , sv hamburg , to eintracht frankfurt - had put asian champions japan two goals up with a brace - in the 57th and 65th minute - inside eight minutes . germany appeared to be on their way to their second home defeat in the two-year reign of manager jürgen klinsmann but hit back late on .
miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect . " one could tell that we 're in the middle of preparing , " said germany captain michael ballack .
" the japanese were more lively .
we had heavy legs , but that 's normal .
the important thing is that we came back again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals to his credit , takahara -lrb- r . -rrb- was japan 's star japan , quarter-finalists at the 2002 world cup , open their world cup campaign game against australia in kaiserslautern on june 12 . klinsmann fielded his strongest team with ballack shrugging off an ankle injury to return on the ground where he made his name with bayer leverkusen .
ballack showed no sign of struggling and was behind most of germany 's best moves early on as the hosts had a succession of corners but could not make any count . japan takes lead but japan had the first opening on the quarter hour mark .
germany were carved open down the left and bolton midfielder hidetoshi nakata forced a brilliant point blank save from goalkeeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later lehmann was called into action again as striker atsushi yanagisawa raced through on goal but hit the ball straight at the arsenal goalkeeper . going forward germany were far more polished and in the 24th minute ballack had a goal-bound shot deflected wide .
lukas podolski then went close with a shot at the near post , though he may have been better playing the ball square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski -lrb- r . -rrb- helped save germany in the 54th minute japan produced the best move of the match with three first time passes releasing yuji nakazawa , but his shot was blocked by marcell jansen .
but three minutes later the breakthrough arrived with takahara finishing a great move by rifling past lehmann .
takahara doubled his tally , and that of his team , eight minutes later with a great swivel turn and thumped a shot past lehmann . klose and schweinsteiger then sealed the german comeback and both sides could have won it in the closing stages . germany face colombia in mönchengladbach on friday for their final warm-up match while japan take on malta in düsseldorf on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

it essentially allows companies in one member state to compete in others without conforming to local bureaucracy .
for some , the legislation was cause for celebration . " it 's a real breakthrough , " said martin bartenstein , austria 's finance minister , adding that the deal would create " hundreds of thousands " of jobs . " the door is open for more growth and competition in the services sector , " german junior minister joachim wuermeling told reporters .
" the eu has shown its ability to act in the most difficult dossier in recent years . " the accord on the new services sector legislation followed nearly nine hours of negotiations on a compromise text drawn up by the eu 's austrian presidency . in the end , all the eu countries finally approved the text , except for lithuania which abstained .
its finance minister said vilnius was looking for " a more profound european integration . " compromise is everything the compromise agreement is a heavily revised version of the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former competition commissioner , frits bolkestein of the netherlands . in its original form the directive proposed that companies offering services as diverse as catering , software and plumbing in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beefy polish plumber featured on a tourism ad became a symbol for unwanted cheap labor but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations - in particular in eastern europe - would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . opponents warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform . in february , the european parliament threw out the original version and presented its own text , which saw the controversial " country of origin " principle replaced with a general rule stating that member states can not discriminate against foreign service providers who are free to trade their business across europe .
in april the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version . it was this draft , in slightly modified form , which was agreed by the bloc on monday . bartenstein said the bloc had avoided the pitfalls of the bolkestein debate . " we were able to avoid a split between the old and new member states , " he said . france , which was one of the most vocal critics of the original proposal , agreed to the modified legislation after it was decided the new rules would be introduced over three years instead of the usual two for eu measures . health care , social services , port services , television and radio , temporary employment agencies and casinos are excluded from the deal . final approval in december bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament is expected to pass the new legislation the bill goes back to the european parliament for a final reading in december .
wuermeling said he expected the assembly to endorse the package . " i would like to see it energize small businesses to relaunch the whole single market , and i see no reason why we wo n't accept it , " said malcolm harbour , a center-right mep who brokered the deal in the assembly earlier this year . the services sector accounts for roughly 70 percent of europe 's economy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

" the german economy appears to be in a position where it could now realize a shift from a regime where demand tended to undershoot supply to one in which more expansionary supply conditions and resulting improved growth prospects feed through into more buoyant demand , " the organization for economic cooperation and development wrote in a special report on germany released on tuesday . " the challenge in this context is to make improvements in a variety of areas - long-term growth , employment creation , public finance sustainability - while at the same time preserving what could well be a genuine recovery in short-run activity extending beyond the export sector , " the report found . the oecd is penciling in gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.8 percent for germany this year and growth of 1.6 percent next year .
unadjusted for the differing number of working days , german gdp was projected to expand by 1.6 percent in 2006 and by 1.5 percent in 2007 , the organization said . the german government , for its part , is penciling in growth of 1.6 percent this year and just 1.0 percent next year .
more work ahead " despite courageous reforms , a lot remains to be done to reduce unemployment and boost employment creation , " the oecd said .
it said that the hurdles " to labor force participation of older employees and females need to be further reduced . "
it continued : " more flexible employment contracts are necessary .
wage rigidities need to be reduced further to fight very high unemployment rates among the low-qualified . " the oecd also said that the education system needed to become more effective .
universities should be funded according to performance and incentives made for universities to raise research performance and improve teaching quality on a broader and more sustained basis . finally , in the area of public finances , the oecd found that " a credible consolidation policy is needed that links expenditure control with public sector reform covering federal fiscal relations , removing distortions in the tax system and making the key government services more efficient .

" the german economy appears to be in a position where it could now realize a shift from a regime where demand tended to undershoot supply to one in which more expansionary supply conditions and resulting improved growth prospects feed through into more buoyant demand , " the organization for economic cooperation and development wrote in a special report on germany released on tuesday . " the challenge in this context is to make improvements in a variety of areas - long-term growth , employment creation , public finance sustainability - while at the same time preserving what could well be a genuine recovery in short-run activity extending beyond the export sector , " the report found . the oecd is penciling in gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.8 percent for germany this year and growth of 1.6 percent next year .
unadjusted for the differing number of working days , german gdp was projected to expand by 1.6 percent in 2006 and by 1.5 percent in 2007 , the organization said . the german government , for its part , is penciling in growth of 1.6 percent this year and just 1.0 percent next year .
more work ahead " despite courageous reforms , a lot remains to be done to reduce unemployment and boost employment creation , " the oecd said .
it said that the hurdles " to labor force participation of older employees and females need to be further reduced . "
it continued : " more flexible employment contracts are necessary .
wage rigidities need to be reduced further to fight very high unemployment rates among the low-qualified . " the oecd also said that the education system needed to become more effective .

naohiro takahara - who is set to move from his current club , sv hamburg , to eintracht frankfurt - had put asian champions japan two goals up with a brace - in the 57th and 65th minute - inside eight minutes . germany appeared to be on their way to their second home defeat in the two-year reign of manager jürgen klinsmann but hit back late on .
miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect . " one could tell that we 're in the middle of preparing , " said germany captain michael ballack .
" the japanese were more lively .
we had heavy legs , but that 's normal .
the important thing is that we came back again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals to his credit , takahara -lrb- r . -rrb- was japan 's star japan , quarter-finalists at the 2002 world cup , open their world cup campaign game against australia in kaiserslautern on june 12 . klinsmann fielded his strongest team with ballack shrugging off an ankle injury to return on the ground where he made his name with bayer leverkusen .
ballack showed no sign of struggling and was behind most of germany 's best moves early on as the hosts had a succession of corners but could not make any count . japan takes lead but japan had the first opening on the quarter hour mark .
germany were carved open down the left and bolton midfielder hidetoshi nakata forced a brilliant point blank save from goalkeeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later lehmann was called into action again as striker atsushi yanagisawa raced through on goal but hit the ball straight at the arsenal goalkeeper . going forward germany were far more polished and in the 24th minute ballack had a goal-bound shot deflected wide .
lukas podolski then went close with a shot at the near post , though he may have been better playing the ball square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski -lrb- r . -rrb- helped save germany in the 54th minute japan produced the best move of the match with three first time passes releasing yuji nakazawa , but his shot was blocked by marcell jansen .
but three minutes later the breakthrough arrived with takahara finishing a great move by rifling past lehmann .
takahara doubled his tally , and that of his team , eight minutes later with a great swivel turn and thumped a shot past lehmann . klose and schweinsteiger then sealed the german comeback and both sides could have won it in the closing stages . germany face colombia in mönchengladbach on friday for their final warm-up match while japan take on malta in düsseldorf on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

1 . world cup at the mercy of modern soccer the world cup 's positioning in the soccer calendar exposes it to the modern game 's injury curse .
coming in the summer after a full domestic and european itinerary , interspersed with international qualifying games and friendlies , the world cup finds itself at the mercy of an increasingly strenuous schedule .
soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .
the liverpool captain has already played 62 games in a season which began for him in july 2005 .
if england reach the world cup final on july 9 and gerrard features in all of their games in germany , he will have played in 71 matches . while not as dangerous as more obvious contact sports such as american football and rugby , soccer still has one of the highest rates of athlete injury ; a rate many experts associate with the amount of games players are expected to take part in . risk of injury increases with number of games played bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more you play , the greater the risk medical studies have shown that injuries are more likely to take place during competitive matches than in practice and training sessions .
a recent study carried out by the american journal of sports medicine showed that the rate of injuries in soccer games was 16.9 injuries per 1000 hours , while the rate of injuries in practice was 7.6 per 1000 hours . for gerrard and other england-based stars , the huge number of games played in the pursuit of major domestic , european and international trophies increases the likelihood of an injury being sustained .
as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .
german clubs suffer from fewer long-term injuries heading towards the finish line than at any stage of the season .
at the same time , english clubs , which have no mid-season break , have more serious injuries at the end of the campaign than at any other period in the calendar . mid-season break results in fewer long-term injuries the mid-season break means bundesliga clubs start the season again in january with rested players after a period of time where those injured before christmas have had sufficient time to recover . this means the number of players missing through long-term injuries dramatically dips just when all the major trophies are being handed out in may . while the effects of a mid-season break are evident at the end of the campaign in the form of the number of players from the bundesliga being fit in comparison to those playing elsewhere in europe , results also show a break benefits teams later in the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham played despite an injury at the 2002 world cup in september 2001 , england beat germany 5-1 in munich in a qualifier for the 2002 tournament .

germany progressed to the final where they were narrowly beaten by england 's conquerors brazil . help future world cups ; reduce players ' workload in reality , it would take a lot to diminish the world cup .
it would take an injury wave of pandemic proportions to wipe out enough players to make a dent in the tournament 's prestige . but as the globe 's pre-eminent soccer championship , the world cup requires the best players in the game to be there .

the parade to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in russia took place on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the gay activists , led by 28-year-old nikolai alexeyev , had planned to lay flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier - a symbol of the world war ii struggle against fascism , and one of russia 's most sacred places .
but they were soon surrounded by dozens of militant orthodox christians and skinheads who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering . in the ensuing scuffles , beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked , " beck told german television .
" it was a stone and a fist .
it shows we 're not safe in this country .
the security forces did not protect us but instead prevented us from retreating .
we were left without any protection . " following the confusion , the german politician was detained and only released after authorities recognized his parliamentary credentials . moscow events spark heated debate in germany pictures of a bloodied beck surrounded by moscow police have triggered strong reactions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homosexuals are far from accepted in russia andreas schockenhoff , russia expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has accused beck of violating the " rules of the game " in russia , saying that one had to obey the political norms of the host country and that beck was only seeking to profile himself by participating in the demonstration . the attack is " naturally outrageous , " said schockenhoff in a newspaper interview .
but by taking part in a banned demonstration , beck had " irresponsibly and willing put himself in danger , " schockenhoff added . schockenhoff 's comments have sparked anger among germany 's greens as well as members of the cdu .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .
confronting it should not only be a police task .

slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .
confronting it should not only be a police task .
it 's a question of mentality in the population .
above all , this kind of brutal ultra-right radicalism is boosted by negligent and demagogic statements by politicians .
when -lrb- bavarian prime minister -rrb- stoiber warns , for example , of the racial dilution of the german people , he is using the kind of vocabulary that validates right-wing violence . mohammed masaad interviewed günter grass -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting literary freedom in germany pen members are meeting in berlin this week to promote literature and freedom of expression .

naohiro takahara - who is set to move from his current club , sv hamburg , to eintracht frankfurt - had put asian champions japan two goals up with a brace - in the 57th and 65th minute - inside eight minutes . germany appeared to be on their way to their second home defeat in the two-year reign of manager jürgen klinsmann but hit back late on .
miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect .

ballack showed no sign of struggling and was behind most of germany 's best moves early on as the hosts had a succession of corners but could not make any count . japan takes lead but japan had the first opening on the quarter hour mark .
germany were carved open down the left and bolton midfielder hidetoshi nakata forced a brilliant point blank save from goalkeeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later lehmann was called into action again as striker atsushi yanagisawa raced through on goal but hit the ball straight at the arsenal goalkeeper . going forward germany were far more polished and in the 24th minute ballack had a goal-bound shot deflected wide .
lukas podolski then went close with a shot at the near post , though he may have been better playing the ball square .

but three minutes later the breakthrough arrived with takahara finishing a great move by rifling past lehmann .
takahara doubled his tally , and that of his team , eight minutes later with a great swivel turn and thumped a shot past lehmann . klose and schweinsteiger then sealed the german comeback and both sides could have won it in the closing stages . germany face colombia in mönchengladbach on friday for their final warm-up match while japan take on malta in düsseldorf on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

naohiro takahara - who is set to move from his current club , sv hamburg , to eintracht frankfurt - had put asian champions japan two goals up with a brace - in the 57th and 65th minute - inside eight minutes . germany appeared to be on their way to their second home defeat in the two-year reign of manager jürgen klinsmann but hit back late on .
miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect . " one could tell that we 're in the middle of preparing , " said germany captain michael ballack .
" the japanese were more lively .
we had heavy legs , but that 's normal .
the important thing is that we came back again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals to his credit , takahara -lrb- r . -rrb- was japan 's star japan , quarter-finalists at the 2002 world cup , open their world cup campaign game against australia in kaiserslautern on june 12 . klinsmann fielded his strongest team with ballack shrugging off an ankle injury to return on the ground where he made his name with bayer leverkusen .
ballack showed no sign of struggling and was behind most of germany 's best moves early on as the hosts had a succession of corners but could not make any count . japan takes lead but japan had the first opening on the quarter hour mark .
germany were carved open down the left and bolton midfielder hidetoshi nakata forced a brilliant point blank save from goalkeeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later lehmann was called into action again as striker atsushi yanagisawa raced through on goal but hit the ball straight at the arsenal goalkeeper . going forward germany were far more polished and in the 24th minute ballack had a goal-bound shot deflected wide .
lukas podolski then went close with a shot at the near post , though he may have been better playing the ball square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski -lrb- r . -rrb- helped save germany in the 54th minute japan produced the best move of the match with three first time passes releasing yuji nakazawa , but his shot was blocked by marcell jansen .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .
confronting it should not only be a police task .
it 's a question of mentality in the population .
above all , this kind of brutal ultra-right radicalism is boosted by negligent and demagogic statements by politicians .
when -lrb- bavarian prime minister -rrb- stoiber warns , for example , of the racial dilution of the german people , he is using the kind of vocabulary that validates right-wing violence . mohammed masaad interviewed günter grass -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting literary freedom in germany pen members are meeting in berlin this week to promote literature and freedom of expression .

naohiro takahara - who is set to move from his current club , sv hamburg , to eintracht frankfurt - had put asian champions japan two goals up with a brace - in the 57th and 65th minute - inside eight minutes . germany appeared to be on their way to their second home defeat in the two-year reign of manager jürgen klinsmann but hit back late on .
miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect . " one could tell that we 're in the middle of preparing , " said germany captain michael ballack .
" the japanese were more lively .
we had heavy legs , but that 's normal .
the important thing is that we came back again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals to his credit , takahara -lrb- r . -rrb- was japan 's star japan , quarter-finalists at the 2002 world cup , open their world cup campaign game against australia in kaiserslautern on june 12 . klinsmann fielded his strongest team with ballack shrugging off an ankle injury to return on the ground where he made his name with bayer leverkusen .
ballack showed no sign of struggling and was behind most of germany 's best moves early on as the hosts had a succession of corners but could not make any count . japan takes lead but japan had the first opening on the quarter hour mark .
germany were carved open down the left and bolton midfielder hidetoshi nakata forced a brilliant point blank save from goalkeeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later lehmann was called into action again as striker atsushi yanagisawa raced through on goal but hit the ball straight at the arsenal goalkeeper . going forward germany were far more polished and in the 24th minute ballack had a goal-bound shot deflected wide .
lukas podolski then went close with a shot at the near post , though he may have been better playing the ball square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski -lrb- r . -rrb- helped save germany in the 54th minute japan produced the best move of the match with three first time passes releasing yuji nakazawa , but his shot was blocked by marcell jansen .
but three minutes later the breakthrough arrived with takahara finishing a great move by rifling past lehmann .
takahara doubled his tally , and that of his team , eight minutes later with a great swivel turn and thumped a shot past lehmann . klose and schweinsteiger then sealed the german comeback and both sides could have won it in the closing stages . germany face colombia in mönchengladbach on friday for their final warm-up match while japan take on malta in düsseldorf on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2006 eu strikes deal on services sector reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new directive sparked protests in many eu countries in a move that marks a significant step forward in forging common market policy , the eu on monday reached agreement on a highly controversial reform of europe 's vast services sector . the landmark deal agreed late monday evening is aimed at boosting growth in the 25-nation bloc by opening the services market to cross-border competition .
it essentially allows companies in one member state to compete in others without conforming to local bureaucracy .
for some , the legislation was cause for celebration . " it 's a real breakthrough , " said martin bartenstein , austria 's finance minister , adding that the deal would create " hundreds of thousands " of jobs . " the door is open for more growth and competition in the services sector , " german junior minister joachim wuermeling told reporters .
" the eu has shown its ability to act in the most difficult dossier in recent years . " the accord on the new services sector legislation followed nearly nine hours of negotiations on a compromise text drawn up by the eu 's austrian presidency . in the end , all the eu countries finally approved the text , except for lithuania which abstained .
its finance minister said vilnius was looking for " a more profound european integration .

the parade to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in russia took place on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the gay activists , led by 28-year-old nikolai alexeyev , had planned to lay flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier - a symbol of the world war ii struggle against fascism , and one of russia 's most sacred places .
but they were soon surrounded by dozens of militant orthodox christians and skinheads who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering . in the ensuing scuffles , beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked , " beck told german television .
" it was a stone and a fist .
it shows we 're not safe in this country .
the security forces did not protect us but instead prevented us from retreating .
we were left without any protection . " following the confusion , the german politician was detained and only released after authorities recognized his parliamentary credentials . moscow events spark heated debate in germany pictures of a bloodied beck surrounded by moscow police have triggered strong reactions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homosexuals are far from accepted in russia andreas schockenhoff , russia expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has accused beck of violating the " rules of the game " in russia , saying that one had to obey the political norms of the host country and that beck was only seeking to profile himself by participating in the demonstration . the attack is " naturally outrageous , " said schockenhoff in a newspaper interview .
but by taking part in a banned demonstration , beck had " irresponsibly and willing put himself in danger , " schockenhoff added . schockenhoff 's comments have sparked anger among germany 's greens as well as members of the cdu . " if one is attacked by another person , then he 's not to blame , " jürgen rüttgers , the conservative premier of the state of north-rhine westphalia told news channel n24 .

the parade to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in russia took place on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the gay activists , led by 28-year-old nikolai alexeyev , had planned to lay flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier - a symbol of the world war ii struggle against fascism , and one of russia 's most sacred places .
but they were soon surrounded by dozens of militant orthodox christians and skinheads who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering . in the ensuing scuffles , beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked , " beck told german television .
" it was a stone and a fist .
it shows we 're not safe in this country .
the security forces did not protect us but instead prevented us from retreating .
we were left without any protection . " following the confusion , the german politician was detained and only released after authorities recognized his parliamentary credentials . moscow events spark heated debate in germany pictures of a bloodied beck surrounded by moscow police have triggered strong reactions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homosexuals are far from accepted in russia andreas schockenhoff , russia expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has accused beck of violating the " rules of the game " in russia , saying that one had to obey the political norms of the host country and that beck was only seeking to profile himself by participating in the demonstration . the attack is " naturally outrageous , " said schockenhoff in a newspaper interview .
but by taking part in a banned demonstration , beck had " irresponsibly and willing put himself in danger , " schockenhoff added . schockenhoff 's comments have sparked anger among germany 's greens as well as members of the cdu . " if one is attacked by another person , then he 's not to blame , " jürgen rüttgers , the conservative premier of the state of north-rhine westphalia told news channel n24 .

it essentially allows companies in one member state to compete in others without conforming to local bureaucracy .
for some , the legislation was cause for celebration . " it 's a real breakthrough , " said martin bartenstein , austria 's finance minister , adding that the deal would create " hundreds of thousands " of jobs . " the door is open for more growth and competition in the services sector , " german junior minister joachim wuermeling told reporters .
" the eu has shown its ability to act in the most difficult dossier in recent years . " the accord on the new services sector legislation followed nearly nine hours of negotiations on a compromise text drawn up by the eu 's austrian presidency . in the end , all the eu countries finally approved the text , except for lithuania which abstained .
its finance minister said vilnius was looking for " a more profound european integration . " compromise is everything the compromise agreement is a heavily revised version of the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former competition commissioner , frits bolkestein of the netherlands . in its original form the directive proposed that companies offering services as diverse as catering , software and plumbing in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beefy polish plumber featured on a tourism ad became a symbol for unwanted cheap labor but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations - in particular in eastern europe - would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . opponents warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform . in february , the european parliament threw out the original version and presented its own text , which saw the controversial " country of origin " principle replaced with a general rule stating that member states can not discriminate against foreign service providers who are free to trade their business across europe .
in april the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version . it was this draft , in slightly modified form , which was agreed by the bloc on monday . bartenstein said the bloc had avoided the pitfalls of the bolkestein debate . " we were able to avoid a split between the old and new member states , " he said . france , which was one of the most vocal critics of the original proposal , agreed to the modified legislation after it was decided the new rules would be introduced over three years instead of the usual two for eu measures . health care , social services , port services , television and radio , temporary employment agencies and casinos are excluded from the deal . final approval in december bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament is expected to pass the new legislation the bill goes back to the european parliament for a final reading in december .
wuermeling said he expected the assembly to endorse the package . " i would like to see it energize small businesses to relaunch the whole single market , and i see no reason why we wo n't accept it , " said malcolm harbour , a center-right mep who brokered the deal in the assembly earlier this year . the services sector accounts for roughly 70 percent of europe 's economy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

it essentially allows companies in one member state to compete in others without conforming to local bureaucracy .
for some , the legislation was cause for celebration . " it 's a real breakthrough , " said martin bartenstein , austria 's finance minister , adding that the deal would create " hundreds of thousands " of jobs . " the door is open for more growth and competition in the services sector , " german junior minister joachim wuermeling told reporters .
" the eu has shown its ability to act in the most difficult dossier in recent years . " the accord on the new services sector legislation followed nearly nine hours of negotiations on a compromise text drawn up by the eu 's austrian presidency . in the end , all the eu countries finally approved the text , except for lithuania which abstained .
its finance minister said vilnius was looking for " a more profound european integration . " compromise is everything the compromise agreement is a heavily revised version of the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former competition commissioner , frits bolkestein of the netherlands . in its original form the directive proposed that companies offering services as diverse as catering , software and plumbing in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beefy polish plumber featured on a tourism ad became a symbol for unwanted cheap labor but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations - in particular in eastern europe - would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . opponents warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform . in february , the european parliament threw out the original version and presented its own text , which saw the controversial " country of origin " principle replaced with a general rule stating that member states can not discriminate against foreign service providers who are free to trade their business across europe .
in april the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version . it was this draft , in slightly modified form , which was agreed by the bloc on monday . bartenstein said the bloc had avoided the pitfalls of the bolkestein debate . " we were able to avoid a split between the old and new member states , " he said . france , which was one of the most vocal critics of the original proposal , agreed to the modified legislation after it was decided the new rules would be introduced over three years instead of the usual two for eu measures . health care , social services , port services , television and radio , temporary employment agencies and casinos are excluded from the deal . final approval in december bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament is expected to pass the new legislation the bill goes back to the european parliament for a final reading in december .
wuermeling said he expected the assembly to endorse the package . " i would like to see it energize small businesses to relaunch the whole single market , and i see no reason why we wo n't accept it , " said malcolm harbour , a center-right mep who brokered the deal in the assembly earlier this year . the services sector accounts for roughly 70 percent of europe 's economy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .
confronting it should not only be a police task .
it 's a question of mentality in the population .
above all , this kind of brutal ultra-right radicalism is boosted by negligent and demagogic statements by politicians .
when -lrb- bavarian prime minister -rrb- stoiber warns , for example , of the racial dilution of the german people , he is using the kind of vocabulary that validates right-wing violence . mohammed masaad interviewed günter grass -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting literary freedom in germany pen members are meeting in berlin this week to promote literature and freedom of expression .

what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .

i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .
confronting it should not only be a police task .
it 's a question of mentality in the population .
above all , this kind of brutal ultra-right radicalism is boosted by negligent and demagogic statements by politicians .
when -lrb- bavarian prime minister -rrb- stoiber warns , for example , of the racial dilution of the german people , he is using the kind of vocabulary that validates right-wing violence . mohammed masaad interviewed günter grass -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting literary freedom in germany pen members are meeting in berlin this week to promote literature and freedom of expression .
germany plays an important role in that respect , the country 's president told delegates on wednesday .
-lrb- may 23 , 2006 -rrb- library of burned books to recall nazi barbarism a german foundation plans to create a " library of burned books " to honor authors persecuted by the nazis .

1 . world cup at the mercy of modern soccer the world cup 's positioning in the soccer calendar exposes it to the modern game 's injury curse .
coming in the summer after a full domestic and european itinerary , interspersed with international qualifying games and friendlies , the world cup finds itself at the mercy of an increasingly strenuous schedule .
soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .
the liverpool captain has already played 62 games in a season which began for him in july 2005 .
if england reach the world cup final on july 9 and gerrard features in all of their games in germany , he will have played in 71 matches . while not as dangerous as more obvious contact sports such as american football and rugby , soccer still has one of the highest rates of athlete injury ; a rate many experts associate with the amount of games players are expected to take part in . risk of injury increases with number of games played bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more you play , the greater the risk medical studies have shown that injuries are more likely to take place during competitive matches than in practice and training sessions .
a recent study carried out by the american journal of sports medicine showed that the rate of injuries in soccer games was 16.9 injuries per 1000 hours , while the rate of injuries in practice was 7.6 per 1000 hours . for gerrard and other england-based stars , the huge number of games played in the pursuit of major domestic , european and international trophies increases the likelihood of an injury being sustained .
as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .
german clubs suffer from fewer long-term injuries heading towards the finish line than at any stage of the season .
at the same time , english clubs , which have no mid-season break , have more serious injuries at the end of the campaign than at any other period in the calendar . mid-season break results in fewer long-term injuries the mid-season break means bundesliga clubs start the season again in january with rested players after a period of time where those injured before christmas have had sufficient time to recover . this means the number of players missing through long-term injuries dramatically dips just when all the major trophies are being handed out in may . while the effects of a mid-season break are evident at the end of the campaign in the form of the number of players from the bundesliga being fit in comparison to those playing elsewhere in europe , results also show a break benefits teams later in the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham played despite an injury at the 2002 world cup in september 2001 , england beat germany 5-1 in munich in a qualifier for the 2002 tournament .
come the world cup itself in japan / korea the following june , england limped out of the championship in the quarter-final after having to leave a number of star players at home injured and playing an unfit david beckham throughout .

it would take an injury wave of pandemic proportions to wipe out enough players to make a dent in the tournament 's prestige . but as the globe 's pre-eminent soccer championship , the world cup requires the best players in the game to be there .

1 . world cup at the mercy of modern soccer the world cup 's positioning in the soccer calendar exposes it to the modern game 's injury curse .
coming in the summer after a full domestic and european itinerary , interspersed with international qualifying games and friendlies , the world cup finds itself at the mercy of an increasingly strenuous schedule .
soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .
the liverpool captain has already played 62 games in a season which began for him in july 2005 .
if england reach the world cup final on july 9 and gerrard features in all of their games in germany , he will have played in 71 matches . while not as dangerous as more obvious contact sports such as american football and rugby , soccer still has one of the highest rates of athlete injury ; a rate many experts associate with the amount of games players are expected to take part in . risk of injury increases with number of games played bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more you play , the greater the risk medical studies have shown that injuries are more likely to take place during competitive matches than in practice and training sessions .
a recent study carried out by the american journal of sports medicine showed that the rate of injuries in soccer games was 16.9 injuries per 1000 hours , while the rate of injuries in practice was 7.6 per 1000 hours . for gerrard and other england-based stars , the huge number of games played in the pursuit of major domestic , european and international trophies increases the likelihood of an injury being sustained .
as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .
german clubs suffer from fewer long-term injuries heading towards the finish line than at any stage of the season .
at the same time , english clubs , which have no mid-season break , have more serious injuries at the end of the campaign than at any other period in the calendar . mid-season break results in fewer long-term injuries the mid-season break means bundesliga clubs start the season again in january with rested players after a period of time where those injured before christmas have had sufficient time to recover . this means the number of players missing through long-term injuries dramatically dips just when all the major trophies are being handed out in may . while the effects of a mid-season break are evident at the end of the campaign in the form of the number of players from the bundesliga being fit in comparison to those playing elsewhere in europe , results also show a break benefits teams later in the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham played despite an injury at the 2002 world cup in september 2001 , england beat germany 5-1 in munich in a qualifier for the 2002 tournament .
come the world cup itself in japan / korea the following june , england limped out of the championship in the quarter-final after having to leave a number of star players at home injured and playing an unfit david beckham throughout .
germany progressed to the final where they were narrowly beaten by england 's conquerors brazil . help future world cups ; reduce players ' workload in reality , it would take a lot to diminish the world cup .
it would take an injury wave of pandemic proportions to wipe out enough players to make a dent in the tournament 's prestige . but as the globe 's pre-eminent soccer championship , the world cup requires the best players in the game to be there .

and it also planned to switch production at its existing amd fab 30 plant from 200-milimeter wafers to 300-milimeter wafers . boosting investment in the region amd has been in dresden in the eastern state of saxony since 1996 and employs about 2,800 people at two factories in the region .
the new projects will bring total investment in the region to more than eight billion dollars .
the investments highlight dresden 's status as one of the few relatively prosperous regions of eastern germany . amd said it would expand 300-mm capacity at the existing amd fab 36 plant and install a new clean room area to handle the site 's growing " bump and test " requirements - one of the final stages of the manufacturing process where wafers are prepared to be shipped for packaging . amd plans to ramp down 200-mm manufacturing in the second half of 2007 , with preparation already underway to ramp up 300-mm wafers on 65-nanometer process technology by the end of 2007 . " as global demand continues to rise for amd products , we are scaling our manufacturing capacity to meet our customers ' growing needs , " said amd chairman and chief executive , hector ruiz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd already enlarged the dresden site in 2004 " to achieve this , we are pursuing an aggressive path to invest in and expand our top-rated manufacturing capabilities in dresden .

amd 's decision to expand in germany runs counter to an overall trend of falling levels of investment in europe 's largest economy . in 2004 , foreign investment in germany fell by 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 39 billion -rrb- , the first drop since 1992 , according to the united nations conference on trade and development , which tracks investment flows . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an economic motor in the stalled east a new comparative study ranking economic dynamism in germany 's federal states has put saxony at the top of the list , setting it far apart from its eastern brethren , most of whose economies are barely limping along .

the parade to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in russia took place on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the gay activists , led by 28-year-old nikolai alexeyev , had planned to lay flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier - a symbol of the world war ii struggle against fascism , and one of russia 's most sacred places .
but they were soon surrounded by dozens of militant orthodox christians and skinheads who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering . in the ensuing scuffles , beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked , " beck told german television .
" it was a stone and a fist .
it shows we 're not safe in this country .
the security forces did not protect us but instead prevented us from retreating .

but by taking part in a banned demonstration , beck had " irresponsibly and willing put himself in danger , " schockenhoff added . schockenhoff 's comments have sparked anger among germany 's greens as well as members of the cdu . " if one is attacked by another person , then he 's not to blame , " jürgen rüttgers , the conservative premier of the state of north-rhine westphalia told news channel n24 .

" the german economy appears to be in a position where it could now realize a shift from a regime where demand tended to undershoot supply to one in which more expansionary supply conditions and resulting improved growth prospects feed through into more buoyant demand , " the organization for economic cooperation and development wrote in a special report on germany released on tuesday . " the challenge in this context is to make improvements in a variety of areas - long-term growth , employment creation , public finance sustainability - while at the same time preserving what could well be a genuine recovery in short-run activity extending beyond the export sector , " the report found . the oecd is penciling in gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.8 percent for germany this year and growth of 1.6 percent next year .
unadjusted for the differing number of working days , german gdp was projected to expand by 1.6 percent in 2006 and by 1.5 percent in 2007 , the organization said . the german government , for its part , is penciling in growth of 1.6 percent this year and just 1.0 percent next year .
more work ahead " despite courageous reforms , a lot remains to be done to reduce unemployment and boost employment creation , " the oecd said .
it said that the hurdles " to labor force participation of older employees and females need to be further reduced . "
it continued : " more flexible employment contracts are necessary .
wage rigidities need to be reduced further to fight very high unemployment rates among the low-qualified . " the oecd also said that the education system needed to become more effective .
universities should be funded according to performance and incentives made for universities to raise research performance and improve teaching quality on a broader and more sustained basis . finally , in the area of public finances , the oecd found that " a credible consolidation policy is needed that links expenditure control with public sector reform covering federal fiscal relations , removing distortions in the tax system and making the key government services more efficient .

naohiro takahara - who is set to move from his current club , sv hamburg , to eintracht frankfurt - had put asian champions japan two goals up with a brace - in the 57th and 65th minute - inside eight minutes . germany appeared to be on their way to their second home defeat in the two-year reign of manager jürgen klinsmann but hit back late on .
miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect .

ballack showed no sign of struggling and was behind most of germany 's best moves early on as the hosts had a succession of corners but could not make any count . japan takes lead but japan had the first opening on the quarter hour mark .
germany were carved open down the left and bolton midfielder hidetoshi nakata forced a brilliant point blank save from goalkeeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later lehmann was called into action again as striker atsushi yanagisawa raced through on goal but hit the ball straight at the arsenal goalkeeper . going forward germany were far more polished and in the 24th minute ballack had a goal-bound shot deflected wide .
lukas podolski then went close with a shot at the near post , though he may have been better playing the ball square .

but three minutes later the breakthrough arrived with takahara finishing a great move by rifling past lehmann .
takahara doubled his tally , and that of his team , eight minutes later with a great swivel turn and thumped a shot past lehmann . klose and schweinsteiger then sealed the german comeback and both sides could have won it in the closing stages . germany face colombia in mönchengladbach on friday for their final warm-up match while japan take on malta in düsseldorf on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

naohiro takahara - who is set to move from his current club , sv hamburg , to eintracht frankfurt - had put asian champions japan two goals up with a brace - in the 57th and 65th minute - inside eight minutes . germany appeared to be on their way to their second home defeat in the two-year reign of manager jürgen klinsmann but hit back late on .
miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect . " one could tell that we 're in the middle of preparing , " said germany captain michael ballack .
" the japanese were more lively .
we had heavy legs , but that 's normal .
the important thing is that we came back again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals to his credit , takahara -lrb- r . -rrb- was japan 's star japan , quarter-finalists at the 2002 world cup , open their world cup campaign game against australia in kaiserslautern on june 12 . klinsmann fielded his strongest team with ballack shrugging off an ankle injury to return on the ground where he made his name with bayer leverkusen .
ballack showed no sign of struggling and was behind most of germany 's best moves early on as the hosts had a succession of corners but could not make any count . japan takes lead but japan had the first opening on the quarter hour mark .
germany were carved open down the left and bolton midfielder hidetoshi nakata forced a brilliant point blank save from goalkeeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later lehmann was called into action again as striker atsushi yanagisawa raced through on goal but hit the ball straight at the arsenal goalkeeper . going forward germany were far more polished and in the 24th minute ballack had a goal-bound shot deflected wide .
lukas podolski then went close with a shot at the near post , though he may have been better playing the ball square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski -lrb- r . -rrb- helped save germany in the 54th minute japan produced the best move of the match with three first time passes releasing yuji nakazawa , but his shot was blocked by marcell jansen .
but three minutes later the breakthrough arrived with takahara finishing a great move by rifling past lehmann .
takahara doubled his tally , and that of his team , eight minutes later with a great swivel turn and thumped a shot past lehmann . klose and schweinsteiger then sealed the german comeback and both sides could have won it in the closing stages . germany face colombia in mönchengladbach on friday for their final warm-up match while japan take on malta in düsseldorf on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 30.05.2006 germany welcomes the walking wounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another one bites the dust : lionel messi pays the price for barcelona 's hectic schedule the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .
could the amount of games played in a season threaten the prestige of future cups ?
would a compulsory winter break ensure more stars are fit ? it would be a coach 's dream to field such a team : portugal 's jorge andrade marshalling the defense with germany 's robert huth beside him and compatriot philipp lahm speeding up the wing from left back ; england 's ledley king ahead of the back four feeding a midfield featuring australia 's harry kewell , argentinean prodigy lionel messi and team captain michael ballack . the attacking force of italy 's christian vieri and england 's striking duo michael owen and wayne rooney would complete the world class line-up . unfortunately , for the international coaches who count these players as integral members of their squads , it is currently more of a nightmare .
because these stars , who would light up any team and were due to shine for their countries at the world cup in germany , are either out of the tournament through injury or are facing a race against time to get fit before it begins on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal : wayne broke his foot again andrade , vieri and king will definitely not be there this summer .
rooney , messi and kewell are all sweating over medical results which could rule them out of the tournament while ballack , huth and lahm - crocked in post season warm-ups - are expected to recover from their minor injuries in time .
michael owen has yet to play a full game since breaking his foot on jan .
1 . world cup at the mercy of modern soccer the world cup 's positioning in the soccer calendar exposes it to the modern game 's injury curse .
coming in the summer after a full domestic and european itinerary , interspersed with international qualifying games and friendlies , the world cup finds itself at the mercy of an increasingly strenuous schedule .
soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .
the liverpool captain has already played 62 games in a season which began for him in july 2005 .
if england reach the world cup final on july 9 and gerrard features in all of their games in germany , he will have played in 71 matches . while not as dangerous as more obvious contact sports such as american football and rugby , soccer still has one of the highest rates of athlete injury ; a rate many experts associate with the amount of games players are expected to take part in . risk of injury increases with number of games played bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more you play , the greater the risk medical studies have shown that injuries are more likely to take place during competitive matches than in practice and training sessions .
a recent study carried out by the american journal of sports medicine showed that the rate of injuries in soccer games was 16.9 injuries per 1000 hours , while the rate of injuries in practice was 7.6 per 1000 hours . for gerrard and other england-based stars , the huge number of games played in the pursuit of major domestic , european and international trophies increases the likelihood of an injury being sustained .
as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .
german clubs suffer from fewer long-term injuries heading towards the finish line than at any stage of the season .
at the same time , english clubs , which have no mid-season break , have more serious injuries at the end of the campaign than at any other period in the calendar . mid-season break results in fewer long-term injuries the mid-season break means bundesliga clubs start the season again in january with rested players after a period of time where those injured before christmas have had sufficient time to recover . this means the number of players missing through long-term injuries dramatically dips just when all the major trophies are being handed out in may . while the effects of a mid-season break are evident at the end of the campaign in the form of the number of players from the bundesliga being fit in comparison to those playing elsewhere in europe , results also show a break benefits teams later in the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham played despite an injury at the 2002 world cup in september 2001 , england beat germany 5-1 in munich in a qualifier for the 2002 tournament .
come the world cup itself in japan / korea the following june , england limped out of the championship in the quarter-final after having to leave a number of star players at home injured and playing an unfit david beckham throughout .
germany progressed to the final where they were narrowly beaten by england 's conquerors brazil . help future world cups ; reduce players ' workload in reality , it would take a lot to diminish the world cup .
it would take an injury wave of pandemic proportions to wipe out enough players to make a dent in the tournament 's prestige . but as the globe 's pre-eminent soccer championship , the world cup requires the best players in the game to be there .
surely a reduction in the number of matches played in leagues where there is no mid-season break would not only be beneficial for the players but for the game as a whole . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's richest soccer clubs sue fifa over players ' use the g14 group of europe 's 18 most powerful soccer clubs have launched a bid to sue fifa for 860 million euros -lrb- $ 1,000 million -rrb- over what it sees as the unlawful use of club players in national teams .

soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .

as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .

and it also planned to switch production at its existing amd fab 30 plant from 200-milimeter wafers to 300-milimeter wafers . boosting investment in the region amd has been in dresden in the eastern state of saxony since 1996 and employs about 2,800 people at two factories in the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : günter grass grass defends long silence as book sales soar nobel prize winner grass under fire for belated ss confession opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all judging grass culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.05.2006 " i do n't hold onto ideological distortions " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skeptical about ideologies of making things better : german novelist günter grass dw-world.de spoke to german novelist and nobel prize winner günter grass about international pen , germany , the role of the writer in contemporary society and a world without peace . the 72nd world congress of international pen took place in berlin from may 22-29 .
the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .
confronting it should not only be a police task .
it 's a question of mentality in the population .
above all , this kind of brutal ultra-right radicalism is boosted by negligent and demagogic statements by politicians .
when -lrb- bavarian prime minister -rrb- stoiber warns , for example , of the racial dilution of the german people , he is using the kind of vocabulary that validates right-wing violence . mohammed masaad interviewed günter grass -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting literary freedom in germany pen members are meeting in berlin this week to promote literature and freedom of expression .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2006 eu strikes deal on services sector reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new directive sparked protests in many eu countries in a move that marks a significant step forward in forging common market policy , the eu on monday reached agreement on a highly controversial reform of europe 's vast services sector . the landmark deal agreed late monday evening is aimed at boosting growth in the 25-nation bloc by opening the services market to cross-border competition .
it essentially allows companies in one member state to compete in others without conforming to local bureaucracy .
for some , the legislation was cause for celebration . " it 's a real breakthrough , " said martin bartenstein , austria 's finance minister , adding that the deal would create " hundreds of thousands " of jobs . " the door is open for more growth and competition in the services sector , " german junior minister joachim wuermeling told reporters .
" the eu has shown its ability to act in the most difficult dossier in recent years . " the accord on the new services sector legislation followed nearly nine hours of negotiations on a compromise text drawn up by the eu 's austrian presidency . in the end , all the eu countries finally approved the text , except for lithuania which abstained .
its finance minister said vilnius was looking for " a more profound european integration . " compromise is everything the compromise agreement is a heavily revised version of the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former competition commissioner , frits bolkestein of the netherlands . in its original form the directive proposed that companies offering services as diverse as catering , software and plumbing in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beefy polish plumber featured on a tourism ad became a symbol for unwanted cheap labor but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations - in particular in eastern europe - would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . opponents warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform . in february , the european parliament threw out the original version and presented its own text , which saw the controversial " country of origin " principle replaced with a general rule stating that member states can not discriminate against foreign service providers who are free to trade their business across europe .
in april the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version . it was this draft , in slightly modified form , which was agreed by the bloc on monday . bartenstein said the bloc had avoided the pitfalls of the bolkestein debate . " we were able to avoid a split between the old and new member states , " he said . france , which was one of the most vocal critics of the original proposal , agreed to the modified legislation after it was decided the new rules would be introduced over three years instead of the usual two for eu measures . health care , social services , port services , television and radio , temporary employment agencies and casinos are excluded from the deal . final approval in december bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament is expected to pass the new legislation the bill goes back to the european parliament for a final reading in december .
wuermeling said he expected the assembly to endorse the package . " i would like to see it energize small businesses to relaunch the whole single market , and i see no reason why we wo n't accept it , " said malcolm harbour , a center-right mep who brokered the deal in the assembly earlier this year . the services sector accounts for roughly 70 percent of europe 's economy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

it essentially allows companies in one member state to compete in others without conforming to local bureaucracy .
for some , the legislation was cause for celebration . " it 's a real breakthrough , " said martin bartenstein , austria 's finance minister , adding that the deal would create " hundreds of thousands " of jobs . " the door is open for more growth and competition in the services sector , " german junior minister joachim wuermeling told reporters .
" the eu has shown its ability to act in the most difficult dossier in recent years . " the accord on the new services sector legislation followed nearly nine hours of negotiations on a compromise text drawn up by the eu 's austrian presidency . in the end , all the eu countries finally approved the text , except for lithuania which abstained .
its finance minister said vilnius was looking for " a more profound european integration . " compromise is everything the compromise agreement is a heavily revised version of the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former competition commissioner , frits bolkestein of the netherlands . in its original form the directive proposed that companies offering services as diverse as catering , software and plumbing in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beefy polish plumber featured on a tourism ad became a symbol for unwanted cheap labor but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations - in particular in eastern europe - would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . opponents warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform . in february , the european parliament threw out the original version and presented its own text , which saw the controversial " country of origin " principle replaced with a general rule stating that member states can not discriminate against foreign service providers who are free to trade their business across europe .
in april the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version . it was this draft , in slightly modified form , which was agreed by the bloc on monday . bartenstein said the bloc had avoided the pitfalls of the bolkestein debate . " we were able to avoid a split between the old and new member states , " he said . france , which was one of the most vocal critics of the original proposal , agreed to the modified legislation after it was decided the new rules would be introduced over three years instead of the usual two for eu measures . health care , social services , port services , television and radio , temporary employment agencies and casinos are excluded from the deal . final approval in december bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament is expected to pass the new legislation the bill goes back to the european parliament for a final reading in december .
wuermeling said he expected the assembly to endorse the package . " i would like to see it energize small businesses to relaunch the whole single market , and i see no reason why we wo n't accept it , " said malcolm harbour , a center-right mep who brokered the deal in the assembly earlier this year . the services sector accounts for roughly 70 percent of europe 's economy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

the parade to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in russia took place on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the gay activists , led by 28-year-old nikolai alexeyev , had planned to lay flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier - a symbol of the world war ii struggle against fascism , and one of russia 's most sacred places .
but they were soon surrounded by dozens of militant orthodox christians and skinheads who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering . in the ensuing scuffles , beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked , " beck told german television .
" it was a stone and a fist .
it shows we 're not safe in this country .
the security forces did not protect us but instead prevented us from retreating .
we were left without any protection . " following the confusion , the german politician was detained and only released after authorities recognized his parliamentary credentials . moscow events spark heated debate in germany pictures of a bloodied beck surrounded by moscow police have triggered strong reactions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homosexuals are far from accepted in russia andreas schockenhoff , russia expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has accused beck of violating the " rules of the game " in russia , saying that one had to obey the political norms of the host country and that beck was only seeking to profile himself by participating in the demonstration . the attack is " naturally outrageous , " said schockenhoff in a newspaper interview .
but by taking part in a banned demonstration , beck had " irresponsibly and willing put himself in danger , " schockenhoff added . schockenhoff 's comments have sparked anger among germany 's greens as well as members of the cdu . " if one is attacked by another person , then he 's not to blame , " jürgen rüttgers , the conservative premier of the state of north-rhine westphalia told news channel n24 .
what happened in moscow " is n't worthy of a democracy , " rüttgers added . ruprecht polenz , another member of the cdu , also slammed the bloody turn of events in moscow .
" in russia too , peaceful demonstrations , even if they 're banned , have to be protected by the state from attacks , " polenz told spiegel online . germany urged to take tougher line others have urged the german government to lodge a strongly-worded protest in moscow .

beck pointed out that another gay-rights parade planned in warsaw on june 10 had been banned .
it 's a bit " annoying " that the german government " was n't really interested " about the repression of homosexuals in russia , beck added . in paris , mayor bertrand delanoe " condemned in the strongest terms the unacceptable incidents which disturbed the gay pride march in moscow . "
delanoe called them " grave attacks on respect for human rights and for individual identity , contrary to the basic principles of a democratic nation . " clementine autain , one of delanoe 's aides said : " at the moment when russia is taking over the presidency of the council of europe we are concerned because the russian authorities have n't shown the will to respect human rights , in particular the rights of minorities and freedom of expression . " homophobia part of a bigger problem in russia ? others , however , have pointed out that homophobia is a deeply-entrenched problem in russia . " homophobia is part of the larger problem of xenophobia " in russia today , nikolai alekseyev , the organizer of the protest , said at a news conference .
" this country defeated fascism and today it is again on the rise , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public displays of affection among gay couples are taboo in russia moscow ’ s mayor yuri luzkhov had warned that the event would " provoke outrage in society “ because homosexuality is not natural .
he also claimed that 99 percent of the people in moscow were supportive of the ban . homosexuality was considered a crime in russia until 1993 , and a mental illness up to 1999 .
even today same-sex couples almost never make a public display of their affection .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 30.05.2006 germany welcomes the walking wounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another one bites the dust : lionel messi pays the price for barcelona 's hectic schedule the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .
could the amount of games played in a season threaten the prestige of future cups ?
would a compulsory winter break ensure more stars are fit ? it would be a coach 's dream to field such a team : portugal 's jorge andrade marshalling the defense with germany 's robert huth beside him and compatriot philipp lahm speeding up the wing from left back ; england 's ledley king ahead of the back four feeding a midfield featuring australia 's harry kewell , argentinean prodigy lionel messi and team captain michael ballack . the attacking force of italy 's christian vieri and england 's striking duo michael owen and wayne rooney would complete the world class line-up . unfortunately , for the international coaches who count these players as integral members of their squads , it is currently more of a nightmare .
because these stars , who would light up any team and were due to shine for their countries at the world cup in germany , are either out of the tournament through injury or are facing a race against time to get fit before it begins on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal : wayne broke his foot again andrade , vieri and king will definitely not be there this summer .
rooney , messi and kewell are all sweating over medical results which could rule them out of the tournament while ballack , huth and lahm - crocked in post season warm-ups - are expected to recover from their minor injuries in time .
michael owen has yet to play a full game since breaking his foot on jan .
1 . world cup at the mercy of modern soccer the world cup 's positioning in the soccer calendar exposes it to the modern game 's injury curse .
coming in the summer after a full domestic and european itinerary , interspersed with international qualifying games and friendlies , the world cup finds itself at the mercy of an increasingly strenuous schedule .
soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .
the liverpool captain has already played 62 games in a season which began for him in july 2005 .
if england reach the world cup final on july 9 and gerrard features in all of their games in germany , he will have played in 71 matches . while not as dangerous as more obvious contact sports such as american football and rugby , soccer still has one of the highest rates of athlete injury ; a rate many experts associate with the amount of games players are expected to take part in . risk of injury increases with number of games played bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more you play , the greater the risk medical studies have shown that injuries are more likely to take place during competitive matches than in practice and training sessions .
a recent study carried out by the american journal of sports medicine showed that the rate of injuries in soccer games was 16.9 injuries per 1000 hours , while the rate of injuries in practice was 7.6 per 1000 hours . for gerrard and other england-based stars , the huge number of games played in the pursuit of major domestic , european and international trophies increases the likelihood of an injury being sustained .
as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .
german clubs suffer from fewer long-term injuries heading towards the finish line than at any stage of the season .
at the same time , english clubs , which have no mid-season break , have more serious injuries at the end of the campaign than at any other period in the calendar . mid-season break results in fewer long-term injuries the mid-season break means bundesliga clubs start the season again in january with rested players after a period of time where those injured before christmas have had sufficient time to recover . this means the number of players missing through long-term injuries dramatically dips just when all the major trophies are being handed out in may . while the effects of a mid-season break are evident at the end of the campaign in the form of the number of players from the bundesliga being fit in comparison to those playing elsewhere in europe , results also show a break benefits teams later in the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham played despite an injury at the 2002 world cup in september 2001 , england beat germany 5-1 in munich in a qualifier for the 2002 tournament .
come the world cup itself in japan / korea the following june , england limped out of the championship in the quarter-final after having to leave a number of star players at home injured and playing an unfit david beckham throughout .
germany progressed to the final where they were narrowly beaten by england 's conquerors brazil . help future world cups ; reduce players ' workload in reality , it would take a lot to diminish the world cup .
it would take an injury wave of pandemic proportions to wipe out enough players to make a dent in the tournament 's prestige . but as the globe 's pre-eminent soccer championship , the world cup requires the best players in the game to be there .
surely a reduction in the number of matches played in leagues where there is no mid-season break would not only be beneficial for the players but for the game as a whole . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's richest soccer clubs sue fifa over players ' use the g14 group of europe 's 18 most powerful soccer clubs have launched a bid to sue fifa for 860 million euros -lrb- $ 1,000 million -rrb- over what it sees as the unlawful use of club players in national teams .

to walk into any german boardroom , high level political meeting or even news conference is to walk into a room filled mainly with men . then last year , angela merkel became germany 's first female chancellor and people mused over whether this might be a turning point for women in germany .
another first - the appointment of monika harms as the first female federal prosecutor general on tuesday - is making it look that way . " i think that i provide an example that women can also reach the highest offices , " she said 19 years ago after being appointed to the federal court of justice , the country 's highest appellate court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel started out as ' kohl 's girl ' , but managed to elbow her way to the top a long way up born in 1946 in berlin , harms grew up in frankfurt am main and studied in heidelberg and hamburg .
she started her judicial career in 1974 as a prosecutor in hamburg , responsible for corporate crime .
afterward , she worked as a judge at the district court level and later at hamburg 's fiscal court before being appointed to the federal court of justice . a self-described conservative , harms has been described by her colleagues as a team player known for her integrity and a pragmatic approach to problem-solving .
and although she is a member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , she has never been known as a party hack . harms was considered a favorite candidate for the federal constitutional court , which will have two vacancies this year .
but she let it be known that she would rather have the top prosecutor job .
there , she will enter a boys ' club - following her predecessor kay nehm , who retired this week and who led a team that , for the last decade , has consisted of about 25 men . hope for others ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military and politics have opened to women - but boardrooms are largely closed but it 's doubtful whether harms ' appointment will signal a change in germany for women seeking to break through the glass ceiling .
the statistics do n't look good . the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent .
and a 2006 report on equality by the european commission showed that the wage gap between men and women in germany widened by three percentage points in the past five years - german men earned on average 23 percent more income than women for equal work in 2004 . still , in the realm of politics and law , women have done better since german chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt to his cabinet in 1961 .
schröder had six women in his cabinet , merkel has five .
and women make up about one-third of parliament , up from 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equal opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s - especially a quota introduced by the greens reserving 50 percent of party seats and posts for women . still , most agree that as more and more women climb the ladder , society will get used to seeing them in top posts .

schröder had six women in his cabinet , merkel has five .
and women make up about one-third of parliament , up from 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equal opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s - especially a quota introduced by the greens reserving 50 percent of party seats and posts for women . still , most agree that as more and more women climb the ladder , society will get used to seeing them in top posts .

rooney , messi and kewell are all sweating over medical results which could rule them out of the tournament while ballack , huth and lahm - crocked in post season warm-ups - are expected to recover from their minor injuries in time .
michael owen has yet to play a full game since breaking his foot on jan .
1 . world cup at the mercy of modern soccer the world cup 's positioning in the soccer calendar exposes it to the modern game 's injury curse .
coming in the summer after a full domestic and european itinerary , interspersed with international qualifying games and friendlies , the world cup finds itself at the mercy of an increasingly strenuous schedule .
soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .
the liverpool captain has already played 62 games in a season which began for him in july 2005 .
if england reach the world cup final on july 9 and gerrard features in all of their games in germany , he will have played in 71 matches . while not as dangerous as more obvious contact sports such as american football and rugby , soccer still has one of the highest rates of athlete injury ; a rate many experts associate with the amount of games players are expected to take part in . risk of injury increases with number of games played bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more you play , the greater the risk medical studies have shown that injuries are more likely to take place during competitive matches than in practice and training sessions .
a recent study carried out by the american journal of sports medicine showed that the rate of injuries in soccer games was 16.9 injuries per 1000 hours , while the rate of injuries in practice was 7.6 per 1000 hours . for gerrard and other england-based stars , the huge number of games played in the pursuit of major domestic , european and international trophies increases the likelihood of an injury being sustained .
as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .
german clubs suffer from fewer long-term injuries heading towards the finish line than at any stage of the season .
at the same time , english clubs , which have no mid-season break , have more serious injuries at the end of the campaign than at any other period in the calendar . mid-season break results in fewer long-term injuries the mid-season break means bundesliga clubs start the season again in january with rested players after a period of time where those injured before christmas have had sufficient time to recover . this means the number of players missing through long-term injuries dramatically dips just when all the major trophies are being handed out in may . while the effects of a mid-season break are evident at the end of the campaign in the form of the number of players from the bundesliga being fit in comparison to those playing elsewhere in europe , results also show a break benefits teams later in the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham played despite an injury at the 2002 world cup in september 2001 , england beat germany 5-1 in munich in a qualifier for the 2002 tournament .
come the world cup itself in japan / korea the following june , england limped out of the championship in the quarter-final after having to leave a number of star players at home injured and playing an unfit david beckham throughout .
germany progressed to the final where they were narrowly beaten by england 's conquerors brazil . help future world cups ; reduce players ' workload in reality , it would take a lot to diminish the world cup .
it would take an injury wave of pandemic proportions to wipe out enough players to make a dent in the tournament 's prestige . but as the globe 's pre-eminent soccer championship , the world cup requires the best players in the game to be there .
surely a reduction in the number of matches played in leagues where there is no mid-season break would not only be beneficial for the players but for the game as a whole . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's richest soccer clubs sue fifa over players ' use the g14 group of europe 's 18 most powerful soccer clubs have launched a bid to sue fifa for 860 million euros -lrb- $ 1,000 million -rrb- over what it sees as the unlawful use of club players in national teams .

would a compulsory winter break ensure more stars are fit ? it would be a coach 's dream to field such a team : portugal 's jorge andrade marshalling the defense with germany 's robert huth beside him and compatriot philipp lahm speeding up the wing from left back ; england 's ledley king ahead of the back four feeding a midfield featuring australia 's harry kewell , argentinean prodigy lionel messi and team captain michael ballack . the attacking force of italy 's christian vieri and england 's striking duo michael owen and wayne rooney would complete the world class line-up . unfortunately , for the international coaches who count these players as integral members of their squads , it is currently more of a nightmare .
because these stars , who would light up any team and were due to shine for their countries at the world cup in germany , are either out of the tournament through injury or are facing a race against time to get fit before it begins on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal : wayne broke his foot again andrade , vieri and king will definitely not be there this summer .
rooney , messi and kewell are all sweating over medical results which could rule them out of the tournament while ballack , huth and lahm - crocked in post season warm-ups - are expected to recover from their minor injuries in time .
michael owen has yet to play a full game since breaking his foot on jan .
1 . world cup at the mercy of modern soccer the world cup 's positioning in the soccer calendar exposes it to the modern game 's injury curse .
coming in the summer after a full domestic and european itinerary , interspersed with international qualifying games and friendlies , the world cup finds itself at the mercy of an increasingly strenuous schedule .
soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .
the liverpool captain has already played 62 games in a season which began for him in july 2005 .
if england reach the world cup final on july 9 and gerrard features in all of their games in germany , he will have played in 71 matches . while not as dangerous as more obvious contact sports such as american football and rugby , soccer still has one of the highest rates of athlete injury ; a rate many experts associate with the amount of games players are expected to take part in . risk of injury increases with number of games played bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more you play , the greater the risk medical studies have shown that injuries are more likely to take place during competitive matches than in practice and training sessions .
a recent study carried out by the american journal of sports medicine showed that the rate of injuries in soccer games was 16.9 injuries per 1000 hours , while the rate of injuries in practice was 7.6 per 1000 hours . for gerrard and other england-based stars , the huge number of games played in the pursuit of major domestic , european and international trophies increases the likelihood of an injury being sustained .
as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .
german clubs suffer from fewer long-term injuries heading towards the finish line than at any stage of the season .
at the same time , english clubs , which have no mid-season break , have more serious injuries at the end of the campaign than at any other period in the calendar . mid-season break results in fewer long-term injuries the mid-season break means bundesliga clubs start the season again in january with rested players after a period of time where those injured before christmas have had sufficient time to recover . this means the number of players missing through long-term injuries dramatically dips just when all the major trophies are being handed out in may . while the effects of a mid-season break are evident at the end of the campaign in the form of the number of players from the bundesliga being fit in comparison to those playing elsewhere in europe , results also show a break benefits teams later in the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham played despite an injury at the 2002 world cup in september 2001 , england beat germany 5-1 in munich in a qualifier for the 2002 tournament .
come the world cup itself in japan / korea the following june , england limped out of the championship in the quarter-final after having to leave a number of star players at home injured and playing an unfit david beckham throughout .
germany progressed to the final where they were narrowly beaten by england 's conquerors brazil . help future world cups ; reduce players ' workload in reality , it would take a lot to diminish the world cup .
it would take an injury wave of pandemic proportions to wipe out enough players to make a dent in the tournament 's prestige . but as the globe 's pre-eminent soccer championship , the world cup requires the best players in the game to be there .
surely a reduction in the number of matches played in leagues where there is no mid-season break would not only be beneficial for the players but for the game as a whole . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's richest soccer clubs sue fifa over players ' use the g14 group of europe 's 18 most powerful soccer clubs have launched a bid to sue fifa for 860 million euros -lrb- $ 1,000 million -rrb- over what it sees as the unlawful use of club players in national teams .

the parade to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in russia took place on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the gay activists , led by 28-year-old nikolai alexeyev , had planned to lay flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier - a symbol of the world war ii struggle against fascism , and one of russia 's most sacred places .
but they were soon surrounded by dozens of militant orthodox christians and skinheads who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering . in the ensuing scuffles , beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked , " beck told german television .
" it was a stone and a fist .
it shows we 're not safe in this country .
the security forces did not protect us but instead prevented us from retreating .
we were left without any protection . " following the confusion , the german politician was detained and only released after authorities recognized his parliamentary credentials . moscow events spark heated debate in germany pictures of a bloodied beck surrounded by moscow police have triggered strong reactions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homosexuals are far from accepted in russia andreas schockenhoff , russia expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has accused beck of violating the " rules of the game " in russia , saying that one had to obey the political norms of the host country and that beck was only seeking to profile himself by participating in the demonstration . the attack is " naturally outrageous , " said schockenhoff in a newspaper interview .
but by taking part in a banned demonstration , beck had " irresponsibly and willing put himself in danger , " schockenhoff added . schockenhoff 's comments have sparked anger among germany 's greens as well as members of the cdu . " if one is attacked by another person , then he 's not to blame , " jürgen rüttgers , the conservative premier of the state of north-rhine westphalia told news channel n24 .
what happened in moscow " is n't worthy of a democracy , " rüttgers added . ruprecht polenz , another member of the cdu , also slammed the bloody turn of events in moscow .
" in russia too , peaceful demonstrations , even if they 're banned , have to be protected by the state from attacks , " polenz told spiegel online . germany urged to take tougher line others have urged the german government to lodge a strongly-worded protest in moscow . " it ca n't be that a state assumes that such matters are decided by the rule of force , " arnold vaatz , another cdu member said , adding that berlin had to complain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-fascism is a growing problem in russia volker beck this week urged the german government to do more internationally to champion the rights of homosexuals .
beck pointed out that another gay-rights parade planned in warsaw on june 10 had been banned .
it 's a bit " annoying " that the german government " was n't really interested " about the repression of homosexuals in russia , beck added . in paris , mayor bertrand delanoe " condemned in the strongest terms the unacceptable incidents which disturbed the gay pride march in moscow . "
delanoe called them " grave attacks on respect for human rights and for individual identity , contrary to the basic principles of a democratic nation . " clementine autain , one of delanoe 's aides said : " at the moment when russia is taking over the presidency of the council of europe we are concerned because the russian authorities have n't shown the will to respect human rights , in particular the rights of minorities and freedom of expression . " homophobia part of a bigger problem in russia ? others , however , have pointed out that homophobia is a deeply-entrenched problem in russia . " homophobia is part of the larger problem of xenophobia " in russia today , nikolai alekseyev , the organizer of the protest , said at a news conference .
" this country defeated fascism and today it is again on the rise , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public displays of affection among gay couples are taboo in russia moscow ’ s mayor yuri luzkhov had warned that the event would " provoke outrage in society “ because homosexuality is not natural .
he also claimed that 99 percent of the people in moscow were supportive of the ban . homosexuality was considered a crime in russia until 1993 , and a mental illness up to 1999 .
even today same-sex couples almost never make a public display of their affection .

the parade to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in russia took place on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the gay activists , led by 28-year-old nikolai alexeyev , had planned to lay flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier - a symbol of the world war ii struggle against fascism , and one of russia 's most sacred places .
but they were soon surrounded by dozens of militant orthodox christians and skinheads who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering . in the ensuing scuffles , beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked , " beck told german television .
" it was a stone and a fist .
it shows we 're not safe in this country .
the security forces did not protect us but instead prevented us from retreating .
we were left without any protection . " following the confusion , the german politician was detained and only released after authorities recognized his parliamentary credentials . moscow events spark heated debate in germany pictures of a bloodied beck surrounded by moscow police have triggered strong reactions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homosexuals are far from accepted in russia andreas schockenhoff , russia expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has accused beck of violating the " rules of the game " in russia , saying that one had to obey the political norms of the host country and that beck was only seeking to profile himself by participating in the demonstration . the attack is " naturally outrageous , " said schockenhoff in a newspaper interview .
but by taking part in a banned demonstration , beck had " irresponsibly and willing put himself in danger , " schockenhoff added . schockenhoff 's comments have sparked anger among germany 's greens as well as members of the cdu . " if one is attacked by another person , then he 's not to blame , " jürgen rüttgers , the conservative premier of the state of north-rhine westphalia told news channel n24 .
what happened in moscow " is n't worthy of a democracy , " rüttgers added . ruprecht polenz , another member of the cdu , also slammed the bloody turn of events in moscow .
" in russia too , peaceful demonstrations , even if they 're banned , have to be protected by the state from attacks , " polenz told spiegel online . germany urged to take tougher line others have urged the german government to lodge a strongly-worded protest in moscow . " it ca n't be that a state assumes that such matters are decided by the rule of force , " arnold vaatz , another cdu member said , adding that berlin had to complain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-fascism is a growing problem in russia volker beck this week urged the german government to do more internationally to champion the rights of homosexuals .
beck pointed out that another gay-rights parade planned in warsaw on june 10 had been banned .
it 's a bit " annoying " that the german government " was n't really interested " about the repression of homosexuals in russia , beck added . in paris , mayor bertrand delanoe " condemned in the strongest terms the unacceptable incidents which disturbed the gay pride march in moscow . "
delanoe called them " grave attacks on respect for human rights and for individual identity , contrary to the basic principles of a democratic nation . " clementine autain , one of delanoe 's aides said : " at the moment when russia is taking over the presidency of the council of europe we are concerned because the russian authorities have n't shown the will to respect human rights , in particular the rights of minorities and freedom of expression . " homophobia part of a bigger problem in russia ? others , however , have pointed out that homophobia is a deeply-entrenched problem in russia . " homophobia is part of the larger problem of xenophobia " in russia today , nikolai alekseyev , the organizer of the protest , said at a news conference .
" this country defeated fascism and today it is again on the rise , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public displays of affection among gay couples are taboo in russia moscow ’ s mayor yuri luzkhov had warned that the event would " provoke outrage in society “ because homosexuality is not natural .
he also claimed that 99 percent of the people in moscow were supportive of the ban . homosexuality was considered a crime in russia until 1993 , and a mental illness up to 1999 .
even today same-sex couples almost never make a public display of their affection .
according to activists , discrimination is still a major problem in russian society , with gays and lesbians facing widespread public intolerance . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politician beaten by russian neo-nazis more than 70 people , including a german parliamentarian , were arrested in moscow after russian police , militant orthodox christians and right-wing extremists broke up a gay rights rally .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .
confronting it should not only be a police task .
it 's a question of mentality in the population .
above all , this kind of brutal ultra-right radicalism is boosted by negligent and demagogic statements by politicians .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2006 eu strikes deal on services sector reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new directive sparked protests in many eu countries in a move that marks a significant step forward in forging common market policy , the eu on monday reached agreement on a highly controversial reform of europe 's vast services sector . the landmark deal agreed late monday evening is aimed at boosting growth in the 25-nation bloc by opening the services market to cross-border competition .
it essentially allows companies in one member state to compete in others without conforming to local bureaucracy .
for some , the legislation was cause for celebration . " it 's a real breakthrough , " said martin bartenstein , austria 's finance minister , adding that the deal would create " hundreds of thousands " of jobs . " the door is open for more growth and competition in the services sector , " german junior minister joachim wuermeling told reporters .
" the eu has shown its ability to act in the most difficult dossier in recent years . " the accord on the new services sector legislation followed nearly nine hours of negotiations on a compromise text drawn up by the eu 's austrian presidency . in the end , all the eu countries finally approved the text , except for lithuania which abstained .
its finance minister said vilnius was looking for " a more profound european integration . " compromise is everything the compromise agreement is a heavily revised version of the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former competition commissioner , frits bolkestein of the netherlands . in its original form the directive proposed that companies offering services as diverse as catering , software and plumbing in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beefy polish plumber featured on a tourism ad became a symbol for unwanted cheap labor but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations - in particular in eastern europe - would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . opponents warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform . in february , the european parliament threw out the original version and presented its own text , which saw the controversial " country of origin " principle replaced with a general rule stating that member states can not discriminate against foreign service providers who are free to trade their business across europe .
in april the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version . it was this draft , in slightly modified form , which was agreed by the bloc on monday . bartenstein said the bloc had avoided the pitfalls of the bolkestein debate . " we were able to avoid a split between the old and new member states , " he said . france , which was one of the most vocal critics of the original proposal , agreed to the modified legislation after it was decided the new rules would be introduced over three years instead of the usual two for eu measures . health care , social services , port services , television and radio , temporary employment agencies and casinos are excluded from the deal . final approval in december bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament is expected to pass the new legislation the bill goes back to the european parliament for a final reading in december .
wuermeling said he expected the assembly to endorse the package . " i would like to see it energize small businesses to relaunch the whole single market , and i see no reason why we wo n't accept it , " said malcolm harbour , a center-right mep who brokered the deal in the assembly earlier this year . the services sector accounts for roughly 70 percent of europe 's economy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

it essentially allows companies in one member state to compete in others without conforming to local bureaucracy .
for some , the legislation was cause for celebration . " it 's a real breakthrough , " said martin bartenstein , austria 's finance minister , adding that the deal would create " hundreds of thousands " of jobs . " the door is open for more growth and competition in the services sector , " german junior minister joachim wuermeling told reporters .
" the eu has shown its ability to act in the most difficult dossier in recent years . " the accord on the new services sector legislation followed nearly nine hours of negotiations on a compromise text drawn up by the eu 's austrian presidency . in the end , all the eu countries finally approved the text , except for lithuania which abstained .
its finance minister said vilnius was looking for " a more profound european integration . " compromise is everything the compromise agreement is a heavily revised version of the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former competition commissioner , frits bolkestein of the netherlands . in its original form the directive proposed that companies offering services as diverse as catering , software and plumbing in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beefy polish plumber featured on a tourism ad became a symbol for unwanted cheap labor but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations - in particular in eastern europe - would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . opponents warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform . in february , the european parliament threw out the original version and presented its own text , which saw the controversial " country of origin " principle replaced with a general rule stating that member states can not discriminate against foreign service providers who are free to trade their business across europe .
in april the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version . it was this draft , in slightly modified form , which was agreed by the bloc on monday . bartenstein said the bloc had avoided the pitfalls of the bolkestein debate . " we were able to avoid a split between the old and new member states , " he said . france , which was one of the most vocal critics of the original proposal , agreed to the modified legislation after it was decided the new rules would be introduced over three years instead of the usual two for eu measures . health care , social services , port services , television and radio , temporary employment agencies and casinos are excluded from the deal . final approval in december bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament is expected to pass the new legislation the bill goes back to the european parliament for a final reading in december .

the parade to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in russia took place on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the gay activists , led by 28-year-old nikolai alexeyev , had planned to lay flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier - a symbol of the world war ii struggle against fascism , and one of russia 's most sacred places .
but they were soon surrounded by dozens of militant orthodox christians and skinheads who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering . in the ensuing scuffles , beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked , " beck told german television .
" it was a stone and a fist .
it shows we 're not safe in this country .
the security forces did not protect us but instead prevented us from retreating .
we were left without any protection . " following the confusion , the german politician was detained and only released after authorities recognized his parliamentary credentials . moscow events spark heated debate in germany pictures of a bloodied beck surrounded by moscow police have triggered strong reactions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homosexuals are far from accepted in russia andreas schockenhoff , russia expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has accused beck of violating the " rules of the game " in russia , saying that one had to obey the political norms of the host country and that beck was only seeking to profile himself by participating in the demonstration . the attack is " naturally outrageous , " said schockenhoff in a newspaper interview .
but by taking part in a banned demonstration , beck had " irresponsibly and willing put himself in danger , " schockenhoff added . schockenhoff 's comments have sparked anger among germany 's greens as well as members of the cdu . " if one is attacked by another person , then he 's not to blame , " jürgen rüttgers , the conservative premier of the state of north-rhine westphalia told news channel n24 .
what happened in moscow " is n't worthy of a democracy , " rüttgers added . ruprecht polenz , another member of the cdu , also slammed the bloody turn of events in moscow .
" in russia too , peaceful demonstrations , even if they 're banned , have to be protected by the state from attacks , " polenz told spiegel online . germany urged to take tougher line others have urged the german government to lodge a strongly-worded protest in moscow . " it ca n't be that a state assumes that such matters are decided by the rule of force , " arnold vaatz , another cdu member said , adding that berlin had to complain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-fascism is a growing problem in russia volker beck this week urged the german government to do more internationally to champion the rights of homosexuals .
beck pointed out that another gay-rights parade planned in warsaw on june 10 had been banned .
it 's a bit " annoying " that the german government " was n't really interested " about the repression of homosexuals in russia , beck added . in paris , mayor bertrand delanoe " condemned in the strongest terms the unacceptable incidents which disturbed the gay pride march in moscow . "
delanoe called them " grave attacks on respect for human rights and for individual identity , contrary to the basic principles of a democratic nation . " clementine autain , one of delanoe 's aides said : " at the moment when russia is taking over the presidency of the council of europe we are concerned because the russian authorities have n't shown the will to respect human rights , in particular the rights of minorities and freedom of expression . " homophobia part of a bigger problem in russia ? others , however , have pointed out that homophobia is a deeply-entrenched problem in russia .

he also claimed that 99 percent of the people in moscow were supportive of the ban . homosexuality was considered a crime in russia until 1993 , and a mental illness up to 1999 .

it essentially allows companies in one member state to compete in others without conforming to local bureaucracy .
for some , the legislation was cause for celebration . " it 's a real breakthrough , " said martin bartenstein , austria 's finance minister , adding that the deal would create " hundreds of thousands " of jobs . " the door is open for more growth and competition in the services sector , " german junior minister joachim wuermeling told reporters .
" the eu has shown its ability to act in the most difficult dossier in recent years . " the accord on the new services sector legislation followed nearly nine hours of negotiations on a compromise text drawn up by the eu 's austrian presidency . in the end , all the eu countries finally approved the text , except for lithuania which abstained .
its finance minister said vilnius was looking for " a more profound european integration . " compromise is everything the compromise agreement is a heavily revised version of the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former competition commissioner , frits bolkestein of the netherlands . in its original form the directive proposed that companies offering services as diverse as catering , software and plumbing in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beefy polish plumber featured on a tourism ad became a symbol for unwanted cheap labor but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations - in particular in eastern europe - would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . opponents warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform . in february , the european parliament threw out the original version and presented its own text , which saw the controversial " country of origin " principle replaced with a general rule stating that member states can not discriminate against foreign service providers who are free to trade their business across europe .
in april the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version . it was this draft , in slightly modified form , which was agreed by the bloc on monday . bartenstein said the bloc had avoided the pitfalls of the bolkestein debate . " we were able to avoid a split between the old and new member states , " he said . france , which was one of the most vocal critics of the original proposal , agreed to the modified legislation after it was decided the new rules would be introduced over three years instead of the usual two for eu measures . health care , social services , port services , television and radio , temporary employment agencies and casinos are excluded from the deal . final approval in december bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament is expected to pass the new legislation the bill goes back to the european parliament for a final reading in december .
wuermeling said he expected the assembly to endorse the package . " i would like to see it energize small businesses to relaunch the whole single market , and i see no reason why we wo n't accept it , " said malcolm harbour , a center-right mep who brokered the deal in the assembly earlier this year . the services sector accounts for roughly 70 percent of europe 's economy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

to walk into any german boardroom , high level political meeting or even news conference is to walk into a room filled mainly with men . then last year , angela merkel became germany 's first female chancellor and people mused over whether this might be a turning point for women in germany .
another first - the appointment of monika harms as the first female federal prosecutor general on tuesday - is making it look that way . " i think that i provide an example that women can also reach the highest offices , " she said 19 years ago after being appointed to the federal court of justice , the country 's highest appellate court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel started out as ' kohl 's girl ' , but managed to elbow her way to the top a long way up born in 1946 in berlin , harms grew up in frankfurt am main and studied in heidelberg and hamburg .
she started her judicial career in 1974 as a prosecutor in hamburg , responsible for corporate crime .
afterward , she worked as a judge at the district court level and later at hamburg 's fiscal court before being appointed to the federal court of justice . a self-described conservative , harms has been described by her colleagues as a team player known for her integrity and a pragmatic approach to problem-solving .
and although she is a member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , she has never been known as a party hack . harms was considered a favorite candidate for the federal constitutional court , which will have two vacancies this year .
but she let it be known that she would rather have the top prosecutor job .
there , she will enter a boys ' club - following her predecessor kay nehm , who retired this week and who led a team that , for the last decade , has consisted of about 25 men . hope for others ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military and politics have opened to women - but boardrooms are largely closed but it 's doubtful whether harms ' appointment will signal a change in germany for women seeking to break through the glass ceiling .
the statistics do n't look good . the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent .
and a 2006 report on equality by the european commission showed that the wage gap between men and women in germany widened by three percentage points in the past five years - german men earned on average 23 percent more income than women for equal work in 2004 . still , in the realm of politics and law , women have done better since german chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt to his cabinet in 1961 .
schröder had six women in his cabinet , merkel has five .
and women make up about one-third of parliament , up from 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equal opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s - especially a quota introduced by the greens reserving 50 percent of party seats and posts for women . still , most agree that as more and more women climb the ladder , society will get used to seeing them in top posts .

to walk into any german boardroom , high level political meeting or even news conference is to walk into a room filled mainly with men . then last year , angela merkel became germany 's first female chancellor and people mused over whether this might be a turning point for women in germany .
another first - the appointment of monika harms as the first female federal prosecutor general on tuesday - is making it look that way . " i think that i provide an example that women can also reach the highest offices , " she said 19 years ago after being appointed to the federal court of justice , the country 's highest appellate court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel started out as ' kohl 's girl ' , but managed to elbow her way to the top a long way up born in 1946 in berlin , harms grew up in frankfurt am main and studied in heidelberg and hamburg .
she started her judicial career in 1974 as a prosecutor in hamburg , responsible for corporate crime .
afterward , she worked as a judge at the district court level and later at hamburg 's fiscal court before being appointed to the federal court of justice . a self-described conservative , harms has been described by her colleagues as a team player known for her integrity and a pragmatic approach to problem-solving .
and although she is a member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , she has never been known as a party hack . harms was considered a favorite candidate for the federal constitutional court , which will have two vacancies this year .

schröder had six women in his cabinet , merkel has five .
and women make up about one-third of parliament , up from 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equal opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s - especially a quota introduced by the greens reserving 50 percent of party seats and posts for women . still , most agree that as more and more women climb the ladder , society will get used to seeing them in top posts .

to walk into any german boardroom , high level political meeting or even news conference is to walk into a room filled mainly with men . then last year , angela merkel became germany 's first female chancellor and people mused over whether this might be a turning point for women in germany .
another first - the appointment of monika harms as the first female federal prosecutor general on tuesday - is making it look that way .

afterward , she worked as a judge at the district court level and later at hamburg 's fiscal court before being appointed to the federal court of justice . a self-described conservative , harms has been described by her colleagues as a team player known for her integrity and a pragmatic approach to problem-solving .

schröder had six women in his cabinet , merkel has five .
and women make up about one-third of parliament , up from 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equal opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s - especially a quota introduced by the greens reserving 50 percent of party seats and posts for women . still , most agree that as more and more women climb the ladder , society will get used to seeing them in top posts .

the parade to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in russia took place on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the gay activists , led by 28-year-old nikolai alexeyev , had planned to lay flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier - a symbol of the world war ii struggle against fascism , and one of russia 's most sacred places .
but they were soon surrounded by dozens of militant orthodox christians and skinheads who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering . in the ensuing scuffles , beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked , " beck told german television .
" it was a stone and a fist .
it shows we 're not safe in this country .
the security forces did not protect us but instead prevented us from retreating .
we were left without any protection . " following the confusion , the german politician was detained and only released after authorities recognized his parliamentary credentials . moscow events spark heated debate in germany pictures of a bloodied beck surrounded by moscow police have triggered strong reactions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homosexuals are far from accepted in russia andreas schockenhoff , russia expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has accused beck of violating the " rules of the game " in russia , saying that one had to obey the political norms of the host country and that beck was only seeking to profile himself by participating in the demonstration . the attack is " naturally outrageous , " said schockenhoff in a newspaper interview .
but by taking part in a banned demonstration , beck had " irresponsibly and willing put himself in danger , " schockenhoff added . schockenhoff 's comments have sparked anger among germany 's greens as well as members of the cdu . " if one is attacked by another person , then he 's not to blame , " jürgen rüttgers , the conservative premier of the state of north-rhine westphalia told news channel n24 .
what happened in moscow " is n't worthy of a democracy , " rüttgers added . ruprecht polenz , another member of the cdu , also slammed the bloody turn of events in moscow .
" in russia too , peaceful demonstrations , even if they 're banned , have to be protected by the state from attacks , " polenz told spiegel online . germany urged to take tougher line others have urged the german government to lodge a strongly-worded protest in moscow . " it ca n't be that a state assumes that such matters are decided by the rule of force , " arnold vaatz , another cdu member said , adding that berlin had to complain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-fascism is a growing problem in russia volker beck this week urged the german government to do more internationally to champion the rights of homosexuals .
beck pointed out that another gay-rights parade planned in warsaw on june 10 had been banned .
it 's a bit " annoying " that the german government " was n't really interested " about the repression of homosexuals in russia , beck added . in paris , mayor bertrand delanoe " condemned in the strongest terms the unacceptable incidents which disturbed the gay pride march in moscow . "
delanoe called them " grave attacks on respect for human rights and for individual identity , contrary to the basic principles of a democratic nation . " clementine autain , one of delanoe 's aides said : " at the moment when russia is taking over the presidency of the council of europe we are concerned because the russian authorities have n't shown the will to respect human rights , in particular the rights of minorities and freedom of expression . " homophobia part of a bigger problem in russia ? others , however , have pointed out that homophobia is a deeply-entrenched problem in russia . " homophobia is part of the larger problem of xenophobia " in russia today , nikolai alekseyev , the organizer of the protest , said at a news conference .
" this country defeated fascism and today it is again on the rise , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public displays of affection among gay couples are taboo in russia moscow ’ s mayor yuri luzkhov had warned that the event would " provoke outrage in society “ because homosexuality is not natural .
he also claimed that 99 percent of the people in moscow were supportive of the ban . homosexuality was considered a crime in russia until 1993 , and a mental illness up to 1999 .
even today same-sex couples almost never make a public display of their affection .

naohiro takahara - who is set to move from his current club , sv hamburg , to eintracht frankfurt - had put asian champions japan two goals up with a brace - in the 57th and 65th minute - inside eight minutes . germany appeared to be on their way to their second home defeat in the two-year reign of manager jürgen klinsmann but hit back late on .
miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect . " one could tell that we 're in the middle of preparing , " said germany captain michael ballack .
" the japanese were more lively .
we had heavy legs , but that 's normal .
the important thing is that we came back again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals to his credit , takahara -lrb- r . -rrb- was japan 's star japan , quarter-finalists at the 2002 world cup , open their world cup campaign game against australia in kaiserslautern on june 12 . klinsmann fielded his strongest team with ballack shrugging off an ankle injury to return on the ground where he made his name with bayer leverkusen .
ballack showed no sign of struggling and was behind most of germany 's best moves early on as the hosts had a succession of corners but could not make any count . japan takes lead but japan had the first opening on the quarter hour mark .
germany were carved open down the left and bolton midfielder hidetoshi nakata forced a brilliant point blank save from goalkeeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later lehmann was called into action again as striker atsushi yanagisawa raced through on goal but hit the ball straight at the arsenal goalkeeper . going forward germany were far more polished and in the 24th minute ballack had a goal-bound shot deflected wide .
lukas podolski then went close with a shot at the near post , though he may have been better playing the ball square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski -lrb- r . -rrb- helped save germany in the 54th minute japan produced the best move of the match with three first time passes releasing yuji nakazawa , but his shot was blocked by marcell jansen .
but three minutes later the breakthrough arrived with takahara finishing a great move by rifling past lehmann .
takahara doubled his tally , and that of his team , eight minutes later with a great swivel turn and thumped a shot past lehmann . klose and schweinsteiger then sealed the german comeback and both sides could have won it in the closing stages . germany face colombia in mönchengladbach on friday for their final warm-up match while japan take on malta in düsseldorf on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2006 eu strikes deal on services sector reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new directive sparked protests in many eu countries in a move that marks a significant step forward in forging common market policy , the eu on monday reached agreement on a highly controversial reform of europe 's vast services sector . the landmark deal agreed late monday evening is aimed at boosting growth in the 25-nation bloc by opening the services market to cross-border competition .
it essentially allows companies in one member state to compete in others without conforming to local bureaucracy .
for some , the legislation was cause for celebration . " it 's a real breakthrough , " said martin bartenstein , austria 's finance minister , adding that the deal would create " hundreds of thousands " of jobs . " the door is open for more growth and competition in the services sector , " german junior minister joachim wuermeling told reporters .
" the eu has shown its ability to act in the most difficult dossier in recent years . " the accord on the new services sector legislation followed nearly nine hours of negotiations on a compromise text drawn up by the eu 's austrian presidency . in the end , all the eu countries finally approved the text , except for lithuania which abstained .
its finance minister said vilnius was looking for " a more profound european integration . " compromise is everything the compromise agreement is a heavily revised version of the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former competition commissioner , frits bolkestein of the netherlands . in its original form the directive proposed that companies offering services as diverse as catering , software and plumbing in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beefy polish plumber featured on a tourism ad became a symbol for unwanted cheap labor but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations - in particular in eastern europe - would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . opponents warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform . in february , the european parliament threw out the original version and presented its own text , which saw the controversial " country of origin " principle replaced with a general rule stating that member states can not discriminate against foreign service providers who are free to trade their business across europe .
in april the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version . it was this draft , in slightly modified form , which was agreed by the bloc on monday . bartenstein said the bloc had avoided the pitfalls of the bolkestein debate . " we were able to avoid a split between the old and new member states , " he said . france , which was one of the most vocal critics of the original proposal , agreed to the modified legislation after it was decided the new rules would be introduced over three years instead of the usual two for eu measures . health care , social services , port services , television and radio , temporary employment agencies and casinos are excluded from the deal . final approval in december bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament is expected to pass the new legislation the bill goes back to the european parliament for a final reading in december .
wuermeling said he expected the assembly to endorse the package . " i would like to see it energize small businesses to relaunch the whole single market , and i see no reason why we wo n't accept it , " said malcolm harbour , a center-right mep who brokered the deal in the assembly earlier this year . the services sector accounts for roughly 70 percent of europe 's economy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

it essentially allows companies in one member state to compete in others without conforming to local bureaucracy .
for some , the legislation was cause for celebration . " it 's a real breakthrough , " said martin bartenstein , austria 's finance minister , adding that the deal would create " hundreds of thousands " of jobs . " the door is open for more growth and competition in the services sector , " german junior minister joachim wuermeling told reporters .
" the eu has shown its ability to act in the most difficult dossier in recent years . " the accord on the new services sector legislation followed nearly nine hours of negotiations on a compromise text drawn up by the eu 's austrian presidency . in the end , all the eu countries finally approved the text , except for lithuania which abstained .
its finance minister said vilnius was looking for " a more profound european integration . " compromise is everything the compromise agreement is a heavily revised version of the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former competition commissioner , frits bolkestein of the netherlands . in its original form the directive proposed that companies offering services as diverse as catering , software and plumbing in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beefy polish plumber featured on a tourism ad became a symbol for unwanted cheap labor but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations - in particular in eastern europe - would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . opponents warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform . in february , the european parliament threw out the original version and presented its own text , which saw the controversial " country of origin " principle replaced with a general rule stating that member states can not discriminate against foreign service providers who are free to trade their business across europe .
in april the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version . it was this draft , in slightly modified form , which was agreed by the bloc on monday . bartenstein said the bloc had avoided the pitfalls of the bolkestein debate . " we were able to avoid a split between the old and new member states , " he said . france , which was one of the most vocal critics of the original proposal , agreed to the modified legislation after it was decided the new rules would be introduced over three years instead of the usual two for eu measures . health care , social services , port services , television and radio , temporary employment agencies and casinos are excluded from the deal . final approval in december bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament is expected to pass the new legislation the bill goes back to the european parliament for a final reading in december .
wuermeling said he expected the assembly to endorse the package . " i would like to see it energize small businesses to relaunch the whole single market , and i see no reason why we wo n't accept it , " said malcolm harbour , a center-right mep who brokered the deal in the assembly earlier this year . the services sector accounts for roughly 70 percent of europe 's economy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .
confronting it should not only be a police task .
it 's a question of mentality in the population .
above all , this kind of brutal ultra-right radicalism is boosted by negligent and demagogic statements by politicians .
when -lrb- bavarian prime minister -rrb- stoiber warns , for example , of the racial dilution of the german people , he is using the kind of vocabulary that validates right-wing violence . mohammed masaad interviewed günter grass -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting literary freedom in germany pen members are meeting in berlin this week to promote literature and freedom of expression .

" the challenge in this context is to make improvements in a variety of areas - long-term growth , employment creation , public finance sustainability - while at the same time preserving what could well be a genuine recovery in short-run activity extending beyond the export sector , " the report found . the oecd is penciling in gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.8 percent for germany this year and growth of 1.6 percent next year .
unadjusted for the differing number of working days , german gdp was projected to expand by 1.6 percent in 2006 and by 1.5 percent in 2007 , the organization said . the german government , for its part , is penciling in growth of 1.6 percent this year and just 1.0 percent next year .
more work ahead " despite courageous reforms , a lot remains to be done to reduce unemployment and boost employment creation , " the oecd said .
it said that the hurdles " to labor force participation of older employees and females need to be further reduced . "
it continued : " more flexible employment contracts are necessary .
wage rigidities need to be reduced further to fight very high unemployment rates among the low-qualified . " the oecd also said that the education system needed to become more effective .
universities should be funded according to performance and incentives made for universities to raise research performance and improve teaching quality on a broader and more sustained basis . finally , in the area of public finances , the oecd found that " a credible consolidation policy is needed that links expenditure control with public sector reform covering federal fiscal relations , removing distortions in the tax system and making the key government services more efficient .

and it also planned to switch production at its existing amd fab 30 plant from 200-milimeter wafers to 300-milimeter wafers . boosting investment in the region amd has been in dresden in the eastern state of saxony since 1996 and employs about 2,800 people at two factories in the region .
the new projects will bring total investment in the region to more than eight billion dollars .
the investments highlight dresden 's status as one of the few relatively prosperous regions of eastern germany . amd said it would expand 300-mm capacity at the existing amd fab 36 plant and install a new clean room area to handle the site 's growing " bump and test " requirements - one of the final stages of the manufacturing process where wafers are prepared to be shipped for packaging . amd plans to ramp down 200-mm manufacturing in the second half of 2007 , with preparation already underway to ramp up 300-mm wafers on 65-nanometer process technology by the end of 2007 . " as global demand continues to rise for amd products , we are scaling our manufacturing capacity to meet our customers ' growing needs , " said amd chairman and chief executive , hector ruiz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd already enlarged the dresden site in 2004 " to achieve this , we are pursuing an aggressive path to invest in and expand our top-rated manufacturing capabilities in dresden .
these strategic investments highlight how significant germany and europe are to the future of amd competitiveness , " ruiz said . overall declining investment the $ 2.5 billion investment will create about 420 jobs , but hans deppe , general manager of amd 's dresden plant , said most of the money would go to machinery needed to produce the 300-mm wafers .
amd 's decision to expand in germany runs counter to an overall trend of falling levels of investment in europe 's largest economy . in 2004 , foreign investment in germany fell by 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 39 billion -rrb- , the first drop since 1992 , according to the united nations conference on trade and development , which tracks investment flows . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an economic motor in the stalled east a new comparative study ranking economic dynamism in germany 's federal states has put saxony at the top of the list , setting it far apart from its eastern brethren , most of whose economies are barely limping along .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.05.2006 eu strikes deal on services sector reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new directive sparked protests in many eu countries in a move that marks a significant step forward in forging common market policy , the eu on monday reached agreement on a highly controversial reform of europe 's vast services sector . the landmark deal agreed late monday evening is aimed at boosting growth in the 25-nation bloc by opening the services market to cross-border competition .
it essentially allows companies in one member state to compete in others without conforming to local bureaucracy .
for some , the legislation was cause for celebration . " it 's a real breakthrough , " said martin bartenstein , austria 's finance minister , adding that the deal would create " hundreds of thousands " of jobs . " the door is open for more growth and competition in the services sector , " german junior minister joachim wuermeling told reporters .
" the eu has shown its ability to act in the most difficult dossier in recent years . " the accord on the new services sector legislation followed nearly nine hours of negotiations on a compromise text drawn up by the eu 's austrian presidency . in the end , all the eu countries finally approved the text , except for lithuania which abstained .
its finance minister said vilnius was looking for " a more profound european integration . " compromise is everything the compromise agreement is a heavily revised version of the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former competition commissioner , frits bolkestein of the netherlands . in its original form the directive proposed that companies offering services as diverse as catering , software and plumbing in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beefy polish plumber featured on a tourism ad became a symbol for unwanted cheap labor but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations - in particular in eastern europe - would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . opponents warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform . in february , the european parliament threw out the original version and presented its own text , which saw the controversial " country of origin " principle replaced with a general rule stating that member states can not discriminate against foreign service providers who are free to trade their business across europe .
in april the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version . it was this draft , in slightly modified form , which was agreed by the bloc on monday . bartenstein said the bloc had avoided the pitfalls of the bolkestein debate . " we were able to avoid a split between the old and new member states , " he said . france , which was one of the most vocal critics of the original proposal , agreed to the modified legislation after it was decided the new rules would be introduced over three years instead of the usual two for eu measures . health care , social services , port services , television and radio , temporary employment agencies and casinos are excluded from the deal . final approval in december bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament is expected to pass the new legislation the bill goes back to the european parliament for a final reading in december .
wuermeling said he expected the assembly to endorse the package . " i would like to see it energize small businesses to relaunch the whole single market , and i see no reason why we wo n't accept it , " said malcolm harbour , a center-right mep who brokered the deal in the assembly earlier this year . the services sector accounts for roughly 70 percent of europe 's economy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

michael owen has yet to play a full game since breaking his foot on jan .
1 . world cup at the mercy of modern soccer the world cup 's positioning in the soccer calendar exposes it to the modern game 's injury curse .
coming in the summer after a full domestic and european itinerary , interspersed with international qualifying games and friendlies , the world cup finds itself at the mercy of an increasingly strenuous schedule .
soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .
the liverpool captain has already played 62 games in a season which began for him in july 2005 .
if england reach the world cup final on july 9 and gerrard features in all of their games in germany , he will have played in 71 matches . while not as dangerous as more obvious contact sports such as american football and rugby , soccer still has one of the highest rates of athlete injury ; a rate many experts associate with the amount of games players are expected to take part in . risk of injury increases with number of games played bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more you play , the greater the risk medical studies have shown that injuries are more likely to take place during competitive matches than in practice and training sessions .
a recent study carried out by the american journal of sports medicine showed that the rate of injuries in soccer games was 16.9 injuries per 1000 hours , while the rate of injuries in practice was 7.6 per 1000 hours . for gerrard and other england-based stars , the huge number of games played in the pursuit of major domestic , european and international trophies increases the likelihood of an injury being sustained .
as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .
german clubs suffer from fewer long-term injuries heading towards the finish line than at any stage of the season .
at the same time , english clubs , which have no mid-season break , have more serious injuries at the end of the campaign than at any other period in the calendar . mid-season break results in fewer long-term injuries the mid-season break means bundesliga clubs start the season again in january with rested players after a period of time where those injured before christmas have had sufficient time to recover . this means the number of players missing through long-term injuries dramatically dips just when all the major trophies are being handed out in may . while the effects of a mid-season break are evident at the end of the campaign in the form of the number of players from the bundesliga being fit in comparison to those playing elsewhere in europe , results also show a break benefits teams later in the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham played despite an injury at the 2002 world cup in september 2001 , england beat germany 5-1 in munich in a qualifier for the 2002 tournament .
come the world cup itself in japan / korea the following june , england limped out of the championship in the quarter-final after having to leave a number of star players at home injured and playing an unfit david beckham throughout .
germany progressed to the final where they were narrowly beaten by england 's conquerors brazil . help future world cups ; reduce players ' workload in reality , it would take a lot to diminish the world cup .
it would take an injury wave of pandemic proportions to wipe out enough players to make a dent in the tournament 's prestige . but as the globe 's pre-eminent soccer championship , the world cup requires the best players in the game to be there .

" the german economy appears to be in a position where it could now realize a shift from a regime where demand tended to undershoot supply to one in which more expansionary supply conditions and resulting improved growth prospects feed through into more buoyant demand , " the organization for economic cooperation and development wrote in a special report on germany released on tuesday . " the challenge in this context is to make improvements in a variety of areas - long-term growth , employment creation , public finance sustainability - while at the same time preserving what could well be a genuine recovery in short-run activity extending beyond the export sector , " the report found . the oecd is penciling in gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.8 percent for germany this year and growth of 1.6 percent next year .
unadjusted for the differing number of working days , german gdp was projected to expand by 1.6 percent in 2006 and by 1.5 percent in 2007 , the organization said . the german government , for its part , is penciling in growth of 1.6 percent this year and just 1.0 percent next year .
more work ahead " despite courageous reforms , a lot remains to be done to reduce unemployment and boost employment creation , " the oecd said .
it said that the hurdles " to labor force participation of older employees and females need to be further reduced . "
it continued : " more flexible employment contracts are necessary .
wage rigidities need to be reduced further to fight very high unemployment rates among the low-qualified . " the oecd also said that the education system needed to become more effective .
universities should be funded according to performance and incentives made for universities to raise research performance and improve teaching quality on a broader and more sustained basis . finally , in the area of public finances , the oecd found that " a credible consolidation policy is needed that links expenditure control with public sector reform covering federal fiscal relations , removing distortions in the tax system and making the key government services more efficient .

could the amount of games played in a season threaten the prestige of future cups ?
would a compulsory winter break ensure more stars are fit ? it would be a coach 's dream to field such a team : portugal 's jorge andrade marshalling the defense with germany 's robert huth beside him and compatriot philipp lahm speeding up the wing from left back ; england 's ledley king ahead of the back four feeding a midfield featuring australia 's harry kewell , argentinean prodigy lionel messi and team captain michael ballack . the attacking force of italy 's christian vieri and england 's striking duo michael owen and wayne rooney would complete the world class line-up . unfortunately , for the international coaches who count these players as integral members of their squads , it is currently more of a nightmare .
because these stars , who would light up any team and were due to shine for their countries at the world cup in germany , are either out of the tournament through injury or are facing a race against time to get fit before it begins on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal : wayne broke his foot again andrade , vieri and king will definitely not be there this summer .
rooney , messi and kewell are all sweating over medical results which could rule them out of the tournament while ballack , huth and lahm - crocked in post season warm-ups - are expected to recover from their minor injuries in time .
michael owen has yet to play a full game since breaking his foot on jan .
1 . world cup at the mercy of modern soccer the world cup 's positioning in the soccer calendar exposes it to the modern game 's injury curse .
coming in the summer after a full domestic and european itinerary , interspersed with international qualifying games and friendlies , the world cup finds itself at the mercy of an increasingly strenuous schedule .
soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .
the liverpool captain has already played 62 games in a season which began for him in july 2005 .
if england reach the world cup final on july 9 and gerrard features in all of their games in germany , he will have played in 71 matches . while not as dangerous as more obvious contact sports such as american football and rugby , soccer still has one of the highest rates of athlete injury ; a rate many experts associate with the amount of games players are expected to take part in . risk of injury increases with number of games played bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more you play , the greater the risk medical studies have shown that injuries are more likely to take place during competitive matches than in practice and training sessions .
a recent study carried out by the american journal of sports medicine showed that the rate of injuries in soccer games was 16.9 injuries per 1000 hours , while the rate of injuries in practice was 7.6 per 1000 hours . for gerrard and other england-based stars , the huge number of games played in the pursuit of major domestic , european and international trophies increases the likelihood of an injury being sustained .
as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .
german clubs suffer from fewer long-term injuries heading towards the finish line than at any stage of the season .
at the same time , english clubs , which have no mid-season break , have more serious injuries at the end of the campaign than at any other period in the calendar . mid-season break results in fewer long-term injuries the mid-season break means bundesliga clubs start the season again in january with rested players after a period of time where those injured before christmas have had sufficient time to recover . this means the number of players missing through long-term injuries dramatically dips just when all the major trophies are being handed out in may . while the effects of a mid-season break are evident at the end of the campaign in the form of the number of players from the bundesliga being fit in comparison to those playing elsewhere in europe , results also show a break benefits teams later in the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham played despite an injury at the 2002 world cup in september 2001 , england beat germany 5-1 in munich in a qualifier for the 2002 tournament .
come the world cup itself in japan / korea the following june , england limped out of the championship in the quarter-final after having to leave a number of star players at home injured and playing an unfit david beckham throughout .
germany progressed to the final where they were narrowly beaten by england 's conquerors brazil . help future world cups ; reduce players ' workload in reality , it would take a lot to diminish the world cup .
it would take an injury wave of pandemic proportions to wipe out enough players to make a dent in the tournament 's prestige . but as the globe 's pre-eminent soccer championship , the world cup requires the best players in the game to be there .
surely a reduction in the number of matches played in leagues where there is no mid-season break would not only be beneficial for the players but for the game as a whole . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's richest soccer clubs sue fifa over players ' use the g14 group of europe 's 18 most powerful soccer clubs have launched a bid to sue fifa for 860 million euros -lrb- $ 1,000 million -rrb- over what it sees as the unlawful use of club players in national teams .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .
confronting it should not only be a police task .
it 's a question of mentality in the population .
above all , this kind of brutal ultra-right radicalism is boosted by negligent and demagogic statements by politicians .

it essentially allows companies in one member state to compete in others without conforming to local bureaucracy .
for some , the legislation was cause for celebration . " it 's a real breakthrough , " said martin bartenstein , austria 's finance minister , adding that the deal would create " hundreds of thousands " of jobs . " the door is open for more growth and competition in the services sector , " german junior minister joachim wuermeling told reporters .
" the eu has shown its ability to act in the most difficult dossier in recent years . " the accord on the new services sector legislation followed nearly nine hours of negotiations on a compromise text drawn up by the eu 's austrian presidency . in the end , all the eu countries finally approved the text , except for lithuania which abstained .
its finance minister said vilnius was looking for " a more profound european integration . " compromise is everything the compromise agreement is a heavily revised version of the so-called bolkestein directive , named after the former competition commissioner , frits bolkestein of the netherlands . in its original form the directive proposed that companies offering services as diverse as catering , software and plumbing in the eu be allowed to operate under the laws and regulations of their country of origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beefy polish plumber featured on a tourism ad became a symbol for unwanted cheap labor but many western european countries and trade unions feared that companies from countries with fewer taxes and regulations - in particular in eastern europe - would be able to operate in higher-cost economies without paying their employees the local rate . opponents warned the directive would lead to " social dumping " - companies and jobs relocating to eastern europe or using low-cost labor in jobs like construction throughout the rest of the european union . anti-globalization and left-wing demonstrators took to the streets in france , germany and greece to oppose the reform . in february , the european parliament threw out the original version and presented its own text , which saw the controversial " country of origin " principle replaced with a general rule stating that member states can not discriminate against foreign service providers who are free to trade their business across europe .
in april the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , produced a draft that largely echoed the parliament 's version . it was this draft , in slightly modified form , which was agreed by the bloc on monday . bartenstein said the bloc had avoided the pitfalls of the bolkestein debate . " we were able to avoid a split between the old and new member states , " he said . france , which was one of the most vocal critics of the original proposal , agreed to the modified legislation after it was decided the new rules would be introduced over three years instead of the usual two for eu measures . health care , social services , port services , television and radio , temporary employment agencies and casinos are excluded from the deal . final approval in december bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu parliament is expected to pass the new legislation the bill goes back to the european parliament for a final reading in december .
wuermeling said he expected the assembly to endorse the package . " i would like to see it energize small businesses to relaunch the whole single market , and i see no reason why we wo n't accept it , " said malcolm harbour , a center-right mep who brokered the deal in the assembly earlier this year . the services sector accounts for roughly 70 percent of europe 's economy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de getting europe , inc .

the parade to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in russia took place on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the gay activists , led by 28-year-old nikolai alexeyev , had planned to lay flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier - a symbol of the world war ii struggle against fascism , and one of russia 's most sacred places .
but they were soon surrounded by dozens of militant orthodox christians and skinheads who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering . in the ensuing scuffles , beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked , " beck told german television .
" it was a stone and a fist .
it shows we 're not safe in this country .
the security forces did not protect us but instead prevented us from retreating .
we were left without any protection . " following the confusion , the german politician was detained and only released after authorities recognized his parliamentary credentials . moscow events spark heated debate in germany pictures of a bloodied beck surrounded by moscow police have triggered strong reactions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homosexuals are far from accepted in russia andreas schockenhoff , russia expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has accused beck of violating the " rules of the game " in russia , saying that one had to obey the political norms of the host country and that beck was only seeking to profile himself by participating in the demonstration . the attack is " naturally outrageous , " said schockenhoff in a newspaper interview .
but by taking part in a banned demonstration , beck had " irresponsibly and willing put himself in danger , " schockenhoff added . schockenhoff 's comments have sparked anger among germany 's greens as well as members of the cdu . " if one is attacked by another person , then he 's not to blame , " jürgen rüttgers , the conservative premier of the state of north-rhine westphalia told news channel n24 .
what happened in moscow " is n't worthy of a democracy , " rüttgers added . ruprecht polenz , another member of the cdu , also slammed the bloody turn of events in moscow .
" in russia too , peaceful demonstrations , even if they 're banned , have to be protected by the state from attacks , " polenz told spiegel online . germany urged to take tougher line others have urged the german government to lodge a strongly-worded protest in moscow .

beck pointed out that another gay-rights parade planned in warsaw on june 10 had been banned .
it 's a bit " annoying " that the german government " was n't really interested " about the repression of homosexuals in russia , beck added . in paris , mayor bertrand delanoe " condemned in the strongest terms the unacceptable incidents which disturbed the gay pride march in moscow . "
delanoe called them " grave attacks on respect for human rights and for individual identity , contrary to the basic principles of a democratic nation . " clementine autain , one of delanoe 's aides said : " at the moment when russia is taking over the presidency of the council of europe we are concerned because the russian authorities have n't shown the will to respect human rights , in particular the rights of minorities and freedom of expression . " homophobia part of a bigger problem in russia ? others , however , have pointed out that homophobia is a deeply-entrenched problem in russia . " homophobia is part of the larger problem of xenophobia " in russia today , nikolai alekseyev , the organizer of the protest , said at a news conference .
" this country defeated fascism and today it is again on the rise , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public displays of affection among gay couples are taboo in russia moscow ’ s mayor yuri luzkhov had warned that the event would " provoke outrage in society “ because homosexuality is not natural .
he also claimed that 99 percent of the people in moscow were supportive of the ban . homosexuality was considered a crime in russia until 1993 , and a mental illness up to 1999 .
even today same-sex couples almost never make a public display of their affection .

the parade to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in russia took place on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the gay activists , led by 28-year-old nikolai alexeyev , had planned to lay flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier - a symbol of the world war ii struggle against fascism , and one of russia 's most sacred places .
but they were soon surrounded by dozens of militant orthodox christians and skinheads who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering . in the ensuing scuffles , beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked , " beck told german television .
" it was a stone and a fist .
it shows we 're not safe in this country .
the security forces did not protect us but instead prevented us from retreating .
we were left without any protection . " following the confusion , the german politician was detained and only released after authorities recognized his parliamentary credentials . moscow events spark heated debate in germany pictures of a bloodied beck surrounded by moscow police have triggered strong reactions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homosexuals are far from accepted in russia andreas schockenhoff , russia expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has accused beck of violating the " rules of the game " in russia , saying that one had to obey the political norms of the host country and that beck was only seeking to profile himself by participating in the demonstration . the attack is " naturally outrageous , " said schockenhoff in a newspaper interview .
but by taking part in a banned demonstration , beck had " irresponsibly and willing put himself in danger , " schockenhoff added . schockenhoff 's comments have sparked anger among germany 's greens as well as members of the cdu . " if one is attacked by another person , then he 's not to blame , " jürgen rüttgers , the conservative premier of the state of north-rhine westphalia told news channel n24 .

because these stars , who would light up any team and were due to shine for their countries at the world cup in germany , are either out of the tournament through injury or are facing a race against time to get fit before it begins on june 9 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the curse of the metatarsal : wayne broke his foot again andrade , vieri and king will definitely not be there this summer .
rooney , messi and kewell are all sweating over medical results which could rule them out of the tournament while ballack , huth and lahm - crocked in post season warm-ups - are expected to recover from their minor injuries in time .
michael owen has yet to play a full game since breaking his foot on jan .
1 . world cup at the mercy of modern soccer the world cup 's positioning in the soccer calendar exposes it to the modern game 's injury curse .
coming in the summer after a full domestic and european itinerary , interspersed with international qualifying games and friendlies , the world cup finds itself at the mercy of an increasingly strenuous schedule .
soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .
the liverpool captain has already played 62 games in a season which began for him in july 2005 .
if england reach the world cup final on july 9 and gerrard features in all of their games in germany , he will have played in 71 matches . while not as dangerous as more obvious contact sports such as american football and rugby , soccer still has one of the highest rates of athlete injury ; a rate many experts associate with the amount of games players are expected to take part in . risk of injury increases with number of games played bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more you play , the greater the risk medical studies have shown that injuries are more likely to take place during competitive matches than in practice and training sessions .
a recent study carried out by the american journal of sports medicine showed that the rate of injuries in soccer games was 16.9 injuries per 1000 hours , while the rate of injuries in practice was 7.6 per 1000 hours . for gerrard and other england-based stars , the huge number of games played in the pursuit of major domestic , european and international trophies increases the likelihood of an injury being sustained .
as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .
german clubs suffer from fewer long-term injuries heading towards the finish line than at any stage of the season .
at the same time , english clubs , which have no mid-season break , have more serious injuries at the end of the campaign than at any other period in the calendar . mid-season break results in fewer long-term injuries the mid-season break means bundesliga clubs start the season again in january with rested players after a period of time where those injured before christmas have had sufficient time to recover . this means the number of players missing through long-term injuries dramatically dips just when all the major trophies are being handed out in may . while the effects of a mid-season break are evident at the end of the campaign in the form of the number of players from the bundesliga being fit in comparison to those playing elsewhere in europe , results also show a break benefits teams later in the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham played despite an injury at the 2002 world cup in september 2001 , england beat germany 5-1 in munich in a qualifier for the 2002 tournament .
come the world cup itself in japan / korea the following june , england limped out of the championship in the quarter-final after having to leave a number of star players at home injured and playing an unfit david beckham throughout .
germany progressed to the final where they were narrowly beaten by england 's conquerors brazil . help future world cups ; reduce players ' workload in reality , it would take a lot to diminish the world cup .
it would take an injury wave of pandemic proportions to wipe out enough players to make a dent in the tournament 's prestige . but as the globe 's pre-eminent soccer championship , the world cup requires the best players in the game to be there .
surely a reduction in the number of matches played in leagues where there is no mid-season break would not only be beneficial for the players but for the game as a whole . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's richest soccer clubs sue fifa over players ' use the g14 group of europe 's 18 most powerful soccer clubs have launched a bid to sue fifa for 860 million euros -lrb- $ 1,000 million -rrb- over what it sees as the unlawful use of club players in national teams .

coming in the summer after a full domestic and european itinerary , interspersed with international qualifying games and friendlies , the world cup finds itself at the mercy of an increasingly strenuous schedule .
soccer in the new millennium seems to demand more and more of its players . take england 's steven gerrard for example .
the liverpool captain has already played 62 games in a season which began for him in july 2005 .
if england reach the world cup final on july 9 and gerrard features in all of their games in germany , he will have played in 71 matches . while not as dangerous as more obvious contact sports such as american football and rugby , soccer still has one of the highest rates of athlete injury ; a rate many experts associate with the amount of games players are expected to take part in . risk of injury increases with number of games played bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more you play , the greater the risk medical studies have shown that injuries are more likely to take place during competitive matches than in practice and training sessions .
a recent study carried out by the american journal of sports medicine showed that the rate of injuries in soccer games was 16.9 injuries per 1000 hours , while the rate of injuries in practice was 7.6 per 1000 hours . for gerrard and other england-based stars , the huge number of games played in the pursuit of major domestic , european and international trophies increases the likelihood of an injury being sustained .
as a result , players in the premiership face the prospect of coming into a summer tournament carrying injuries . in contrast , germany-based stars are less likely to become injured towards the end of a season due to the fact that the bundesliga takes a winter break .
german clubs suffer from fewer long-term injuries heading towards the finish line than at any stage of the season .
at the same time , english clubs , which have no mid-season break , have more serious injuries at the end of the campaign than at any other period in the calendar . mid-season break results in fewer long-term injuries the mid-season break means bundesliga clubs start the season again in january with rested players after a period of time where those injured before christmas have had sufficient time to recover . this means the number of players missing through long-term injuries dramatically dips just when all the major trophies are being handed out in may . while the effects of a mid-season break are evident at the end of the campaign in the form of the number of players from the bundesliga being fit in comparison to those playing elsewhere in europe , results also show a break benefits teams later in the year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham played despite an injury at the 2002 world cup in september 2001 , england beat germany 5-1 in munich in a qualifier for the 2002 tournament .
come the world cup itself in japan / korea the following june , england limped out of the championship in the quarter-final after having to leave a number of star players at home injured and playing an unfit david beckham throughout .
germany progressed to the final where they were narrowly beaten by england 's conquerors brazil . help future world cups ; reduce players ' workload in reality , it would take a lot to diminish the world cup .
it would take an injury wave of pandemic proportions to wipe out enough players to make a dent in the tournament 's prestige . but as the globe 's pre-eminent soccer championship , the world cup requires the best players in the game to be there .
surely a reduction in the number of matches played in leagues where there is no mid-season break would not only be beneficial for the players but for the game as a whole . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's richest soccer clubs sue fifa over players ' use the g14 group of europe 's 18 most powerful soccer clubs have launched a bid to sue fifa for 860 million euros -lrb- $ 1,000 million -rrb- over what it sees as the unlawful use of club players in national teams .

the parade to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in russia took place on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the gay activists , led by 28-year-old nikolai alexeyev , had planned to lay flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier - a symbol of the world war ii struggle against fascism , and one of russia 's most sacred places .
but they were soon surrounded by dozens of militant orthodox christians and skinheads who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering . in the ensuing scuffles , beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked , " beck told german television .
" it was a stone and a fist .
it shows we 're not safe in this country .
the security forces did not protect us but instead prevented us from retreating .
we were left without any protection . " following the confusion , the german politician was detained and only released after authorities recognized his parliamentary credentials . moscow events spark heated debate in germany pictures of a bloodied beck surrounded by moscow police have triggered strong reactions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homosexuals are far from accepted in russia andreas schockenhoff , russia expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has accused beck of violating the " rules of the game " in russia , saying that one had to obey the political norms of the host country and that beck was only seeking to profile himself by participating in the demonstration . the attack is " naturally outrageous , " said schockenhoff in a newspaper interview .
but by taking part in a banned demonstration , beck had " irresponsibly and willing put himself in danger , " schockenhoff added . schockenhoff 's comments have sparked anger among germany 's greens as well as members of the cdu . " if one is attacked by another person , then he 's not to blame , " jürgen rüttgers , the conservative premier of the state of north-rhine westphalia told news channel n24 .
what happened in moscow " is n't worthy of a democracy , " rüttgers added . ruprecht polenz , another member of the cdu , also slammed the bloody turn of events in moscow .
" in russia too , peaceful demonstrations , even if they 're banned , have to be protected by the state from attacks , " polenz told spiegel online . germany urged to take tougher line others have urged the german government to lodge a strongly-worded protest in moscow . " it ca n't be that a state assumes that such matters are decided by the rule of force , " arnold vaatz , another cdu member said , adding that berlin had to complain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-fascism is a growing problem in russia volker beck this week urged the german government to do more internationally to champion the rights of homosexuals .
beck pointed out that another gay-rights parade planned in warsaw on june 10 had been banned .
it 's a bit " annoying " that the german government " was n't really interested " about the repression of homosexuals in russia , beck added . in paris , mayor bertrand delanoe " condemned in the strongest terms the unacceptable incidents which disturbed the gay pride march in moscow . "
delanoe called them " grave attacks on respect for human rights and for individual identity , contrary to the basic principles of a democratic nation . " clementine autain , one of delanoe 's aides said : " at the moment when russia is taking over the presidency of the council of europe we are concerned because the russian authorities have n't shown the will to respect human rights , in particular the rights of minorities and freedom of expression . " homophobia part of a bigger problem in russia ? others , however , have pointed out that homophobia is a deeply-entrenched problem in russia . " homophobia is part of the larger problem of xenophobia " in russia today , nikolai alekseyev , the organizer of the protest , said at a news conference .
" this country defeated fascism and today it is again on the rise , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public displays of affection among gay couples are taboo in russia moscow ’ s mayor yuri luzkhov had warned that the event would " provoke outrage in society “ because homosexuality is not natural .
he also claimed that 99 percent of the people in moscow were supportive of the ban . homosexuality was considered a crime in russia until 1993 , and a mental illness up to 1999 .
even today same-sex couples almost never make a public display of their affection .

naohiro takahara - who is set to move from his current club , sv hamburg , to eintracht frankfurt - had put asian champions japan two goals up with a brace - in the 57th and 65th minute - inside eight minutes . germany appeared to be on their way to their second home defeat in the two-year reign of manager jürgen klinsmann but hit back late on .
miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect . " one could tell that we 're in the middle of preparing , " said germany captain michael ballack .
" the japanese were more lively .
we had heavy legs , but that 's normal .
the important thing is that we came back again . "

ballack showed no sign of struggling and was behind most of germany 's best moves early on as the hosts had a succession of corners but could not make any count . japan takes lead but japan had the first opening on the quarter hour mark .
germany were carved open down the left and bolton midfielder hidetoshi nakata forced a brilliant point blank save from goalkeeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later lehmann was called into action again as striker atsushi yanagisawa raced through on goal but hit the ball straight at the arsenal goalkeeper . going forward germany were far more polished and in the 24th minute ballack had a goal-bound shot deflected wide .
lukas podolski then went close with a shot at the near post , though he may have been better playing the ball square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski -lrb- r . -rrb- helped save germany in the 54th minute japan produced the best move of the match with three first time passes releasing yuji nakazawa , but his shot was blocked by marcell jansen .
but three minutes later the breakthrough arrived with takahara finishing a great move by rifling past lehmann .
takahara doubled his tally , and that of his team , eight minutes later with a great swivel turn and thumped a shot past lehmann . klose and schweinsteiger then sealed the german comeback and both sides could have won it in the closing stages . germany face colombia in mönchengladbach on friday for their final warm-up match while japan take on malta in düsseldorf on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

the parade to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the decriminalization of homosexuality in russia took place on saturday even though authorities had banned the march . the gay activists , led by 28-year-old nikolai alexeyev , had planned to lay flowers at the tomb of the unknown soldier - a symbol of the world war ii struggle against fascism , and one of russia 's most sacred places .
but they were soon surrounded by dozens of militant orthodox christians and skinheads who chanted anti-gay slogans and tried to break up the gathering . in the ensuing scuffles , beck was punched in the face and slightly injured . " i was attacked , " beck told german television .
" it was a stone and a fist .
it shows we 're not safe in this country .
the security forces did not protect us but instead prevented us from retreating .
we were left without any protection . " following the confusion , the german politician was detained and only released after authorities recognized his parliamentary credentials . moscow events spark heated debate in germany pictures of a bloodied beck surrounded by moscow police have triggered strong reactions in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homosexuals are far from accepted in russia andreas schockenhoff , russia expert of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has accused beck of violating the " rules of the game " in russia , saying that one had to obey the political norms of the host country and that beck was only seeking to profile himself by participating in the demonstration . the attack is " naturally outrageous , " said schockenhoff in a newspaper interview .
but by taking part in a banned demonstration , beck had " irresponsibly and willing put himself in danger , " schockenhoff added . schockenhoff 's comments have sparked anger among germany 's greens as well as members of the cdu . " if one is attacked by another person , then he 's not to blame , " jürgen rüttgers , the conservative premier of the state of north-rhine westphalia told news channel n24 .
what happened in moscow " is n't worthy of a democracy , " rüttgers added . ruprecht polenz , another member of the cdu , also slammed the bloody turn of events in moscow .
" in russia too , peaceful demonstrations , even if they 're banned , have to be protected by the state from attacks , " polenz told spiegel online . germany urged to take tougher line others have urged the german government to lodge a strongly-worded protest in moscow . " it ca n't be that a state assumes that such matters are decided by the rule of force , " arnold vaatz , another cdu member said , adding that berlin had to complain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-fascism is a growing problem in russia volker beck this week urged the german government to do more internationally to champion the rights of homosexuals .
beck pointed out that another gay-rights parade planned in warsaw on june 10 had been banned .
it 's a bit " annoying " that the german government " was n't really interested " about the repression of homosexuals in russia , beck added . in paris , mayor bertrand delanoe " condemned in the strongest terms the unacceptable incidents which disturbed the gay pride march in moscow . "
delanoe called them " grave attacks on respect for human rights and for individual identity , contrary to the basic principles of a democratic nation . " clementine autain , one of delanoe 's aides said : " at the moment when russia is taking over the presidency of the council of europe we are concerned because the russian authorities have n't shown the will to respect human rights , in particular the rights of minorities and freedom of expression . " homophobia part of a bigger problem in russia ? others , however , have pointed out that homophobia is a deeply-entrenched problem in russia . " homophobia is part of the larger problem of xenophobia " in russia today , nikolai alekseyev , the organizer of the protest , said at a news conference .
" this country defeated fascism and today it is again on the rise , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public displays of affection among gay couples are taboo in russia moscow ’ s mayor yuri luzkhov had warned that the event would " provoke outrage in society “ because homosexuality is not natural .
he also claimed that 99 percent of the people in moscow were supportive of the ban . homosexuality was considered a crime in russia until 1993 , and a mental illness up to 1999 .
even today same-sex couples almost never make a public display of their affection .

miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect .

the congress topic this year was " writing in a world without peace . "
günter grass - one of germany 's most renowned novelists - took part in the proceedings and gave a lecture at the congress . dw-world.de : this is the third pen congress which took place in germany .
what is the symbolic value of this initiative for germany ? günter grass : i 've participated in the last two meetings - both in hamburg , 20 years ago and today .
i also delivered on both occasions the keynote address .
20 years ago , germany was still divided , as was europe in general , and one part of the discussion was still determined by the east-west dichotomies .
slowly , however , it turned out the problems of the 21st century would no longer be cantered around the conflict between the east and the west , but rather between the north and the south .
in the current situation , the international or global aspects of pen seem to me much clearer than they did 20 years ago . what is your take on this year 's topic " writing in a world without peace ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of persecuted writers are rising in my speech , i said that we always had times without peace - more or less perceived as such .
we in europe - which was peaceful from the end of world war ii until the serbian conflict - thought as if it was peace that had broken out here .
but , because of the mutual scare tactics of the cold war powers , it was sham peace , while wars were actually being fought all over the world .
i tried to make clear in my speech how this condition perpetuates itself over time .
but there are also other possibilities .
there are american companies today that control the grain seeds market and that can , with their seeds which are good for one season only , make whole nations dependent .
that is also a point of view which politicians like willy brandt , whom i respected very much , expressed by saying that hunger was also a form of war . could literature really create peace , though ? we should n't demand too much of ourselves .
in the long run , we could contribute to changes in people 's consciousness .
take , for example , the process of enlightenment in europe .
authors like voltaire or diderot were censored at first , and their works became accepted in different countries and different regions only after a long time .
in some regions of europe , enlightenment has still not taken place .
it 's a slow process of making changes .
but , on the other hand , i am very skeptical about setting the goal of making things better .
usually , it 's ideologues who come and say " there is a goal in the end - the satisfied man , the socialist man , the american way of life , " i.e. happiness through consumption .
that 's all ideological distortions , that i do n't want to hold onto . do writers all over the world perform their role as they should ? i could n't answer that question in general terms .
i think it 's great that pen exists , that writers care about each other , that we have a writers-in-prison program .
the number of persecuted , jailed or murdered writers is on the rise , and we know that pen efforts , often together with amnesty international , are successful in freeing writers , making their imprisonment more bearable or helping them leave their countries .
germany 's pen does that .
writers who are persecuted in their countries can find accommodation here , get a kind of scholarship etc .
that 's a matter of solidarity - an old-fashioned word , i know .
but i believe that solidarity among writers is still effective . what would you say to the immigrant writers living in germany about the german right-wing movement gaining ground ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians also bear responsibility for the rise of the ultra-right politically , the radical right in germany is still isolated .
there are countries , like france , for example , with le pen , where ultra-right parties participate in the government , especially in southern france .
it italy , a post-fascist party ruled together with berlusconi for almost a decade .
in poland , shamefully , the current government is held up by two ultra-right parties .
npd in germany was never elected to parliament - except in regional parliaments and , then , for a very short time .
nonetheless , the far right is active in germany and it gets violent .
confronting it should not only be a police task .

and it also planned to switch production at its existing amd fab 30 plant from 200-milimeter wafers to 300-milimeter wafers . boosting investment in the region amd has been in dresden in the eastern state of saxony since 1996 and employs about 2,800 people at two factories in the region .
the new projects will bring total investment in the region to more than eight billion dollars .
the investments highlight dresden 's status as one of the few relatively prosperous regions of eastern germany . amd said it would expand 300-mm capacity at the existing amd fab 36 plant and install a new clean room area to handle the site 's growing " bump and test " requirements - one of the final stages of the manufacturing process where wafers are prepared to be shipped for packaging . amd plans to ramp down 200-mm manufacturing in the second half of 2007 , with preparation already underway to ramp up 300-mm wafers on 65-nanometer process technology by the end of 2007 .

amd 's decision to expand in germany runs counter to an overall trend of falling levels of investment in europe 's largest economy . in 2004 , foreign investment in germany fell by 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 39 billion -rrb- , the first drop since 1992 , according to the united nations conference on trade and development , which tracks investment flows . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an economic motor in the stalled east a new comparative study ranking economic dynamism in germany 's federal states has put saxony at the top of the list , setting it far apart from its eastern brethren , most of whose economies are barely limping along .

miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect .

takahara doubled his tally , and that of his team , eight minutes later with a great swivel turn and thumped a shot past lehmann . klose and schweinsteiger then sealed the german comeback and both sides could have won it in the closing stages . germany face colombia in mönchengladbach on friday for their final warm-up match while japan take on malta in düsseldorf on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

naohiro takahara - who is set to move from his current club , sv hamburg , to eintracht frankfurt - had put asian champions japan two goals up with a brace - in the 57th and 65th minute - inside eight minutes . germany appeared to be on their way to their second home defeat in the two-year reign of manager jürgen klinsmann but hit back late on .
miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect . " one could tell that we 're in the middle of preparing , " said germany captain michael ballack .
" the japanese were more lively .
we had heavy legs , but that 's normal .
the important thing is that we came back again . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with two goals to his credit , takahara -lrb- r . -rrb- was japan 's star japan , quarter-finalists at the 2002 world cup , open their world cup campaign game against australia in kaiserslautern on june 12 . klinsmann fielded his strongest team with ballack shrugging off an ankle injury to return on the ground where he made his name with bayer leverkusen .
ballack showed no sign of struggling and was behind most of germany 's best moves early on as the hosts had a succession of corners but could not make any count . japan takes lead but japan had the first opening on the quarter hour mark .
germany were carved open down the left and bolton midfielder hidetoshi nakata forced a brilliant point blank save from goalkeeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later lehmann was called into action again as striker atsushi yanagisawa raced through on goal but hit the ball straight at the arsenal goalkeeper . going forward germany were far more polished and in the 24th minute ballack had a goal-bound shot deflected wide .
lukas podolski then went close with a shot at the near post , though he may have been better playing the ball square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski -lrb- r . -rrb- helped save germany in the 54th minute japan produced the best move of the match with three first time passes releasing yuji nakazawa , but his shot was blocked by marcell jansen .
but three minutes later the breakthrough arrived with takahara finishing a great move by rifling past lehmann .
takahara doubled his tally , and that of his team , eight minutes later with a great swivel turn and thumped a shot past lehmann . klose and schweinsteiger then sealed the german comeback and both sides could have won it in the closing stages . germany face colombia in mönchengladbach on friday for their final warm-up match while japan take on malta in düsseldorf on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

" the german economy appears to be in a position where it could now realize a shift from a regime where demand tended to undershoot supply to one in which more expansionary supply conditions and resulting improved growth prospects feed through into more buoyant demand , " the organization for economic cooperation and development wrote in a special report on germany released on tuesday . " the challenge in this context is to make improvements in a variety of areas - long-term growth , employment creation , public finance sustainability - while at the same time preserving what could well be a genuine recovery in short-run activity extending beyond the export sector , " the report found . the oecd is penciling in gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.8 percent for germany this year and growth of 1.6 percent next year .
unadjusted for the differing number of working days , german gdp was projected to expand by 1.6 percent in 2006 and by 1.5 percent in 2007 , the organization said . the german government , for its part , is penciling in growth of 1.6 percent this year and just 1.0 percent next year .
more work ahead " despite courageous reforms , a lot remains to be done to reduce unemployment and boost employment creation , " the oecd said .
it said that the hurdles " to labor force participation of older employees and females need to be further reduced . "
it continued : " more flexible employment contracts are necessary .
wage rigidities need to be reduced further to fight very high unemployment rates among the low-qualified . " the oecd also said that the education system needed to become more effective .

naohiro takahara - who is set to move from his current club , sv hamburg , to eintracht frankfurt - had put asian champions japan two goals up with a brace - in the 57th and 65th minute - inside eight minutes . germany appeared to be on their way to their second home defeat in the two-year reign of manager jürgen klinsmann but hit back late on .
miroslav klose pulled one back with a scrambled effort in the 76th minute and bastian schweinsteiger powered home a header four minutes later to equalize . it was a game full of attacking verve , but it 's surely clear to both klinsmann and japan coach zico will that there is a lot of room for improvement with both defenses suspect . " one could tell that we 're in the middle of preparing , " said germany captain michael ballack .
" the japanese were more lively .
we had heavy legs , but that 's normal .
the important thing is that we came back again . "

ballack showed no sign of struggling and was behind most of germany 's best moves early on as the hosts had a succession of corners but could not make any count . japan takes lead but japan had the first opening on the quarter hour mark .
germany were carved open down the left and bolton midfielder hidetoshi nakata forced a brilliant point blank save from goalkeeper jens lehmann .
two minutes later lehmann was called into action again as striker atsushi yanagisawa raced through on goal but hit the ball straight at the arsenal goalkeeper . going forward germany were far more polished and in the 24th minute ballack had a goal-bound shot deflected wide .
lukas podolski then went close with a shot at the near post , though he may have been better playing the ball square .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski -lrb- r . -rrb- helped save germany in the 54th minute japan produced the best move of the match with three first time passes releasing yuji nakazawa , but his shot was blocked by marcell jansen .
but three minutes later the breakthrough arrived with takahara finishing a great move by rifling past lehmann .
takahara doubled his tally , and that of his team , eight minutes later with a great swivel turn and thumped a shot past lehmann . klose and schweinsteiger then sealed the german comeback and both sides could have won it in the closing stages . germany face colombia in mönchengladbach on friday for their final warm-up match while japan take on malta in düsseldorf on sunday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes the walking wounded the world cup risks being diminished by a number of high-profile absentees .

to walk into any german boardroom , high level political meeting or even news conference is to walk into a room filled mainly with men . then last year , angela merkel became germany 's first female chancellor and people mused over whether this might be a turning point for women in germany .
another first - the appointment of monika harms as the first female federal prosecutor general on tuesday - is making it look that way . " i think that i provide an example that women can also reach the highest offices , " she said 19 years ago after being appointed to the federal court of justice , the country 's highest appellate court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel started out as ' kohl 's girl ' , but managed to elbow her way to the top a long way up born in 1946 in berlin , harms grew up in frankfurt am main and studied in heidelberg and hamburg .

the statistics do n't look good . the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent .
and a 2006 report on equality by the european commission showed that the wage gap between men and women in germany widened by three percentage points in the past five years - german men earned on average 23 percent more income than women for equal work in 2004 . still , in the realm of politics and law , women have done better since german chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt to his cabinet in 1961 .
schröder had six women in his cabinet , merkel has five .
and women make up about one-third of parliament , up from 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equal opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s - especially a quota introduced by the greens reserving 50 percent of party seats and posts for women . still , most agree that as more and more women climb the ladder , society will get used to seeing them in top posts .

to walk into any german boardroom , high level political meeting or even news conference is to walk into a room filled mainly with men . then last year , angela merkel became germany 's first female chancellor and people mused over whether this might be a turning point for women in germany .
another first - the appointment of monika harms as the first female federal prosecutor general on tuesday - is making it look that way . " i think that i provide an example that women can also reach the highest offices , " she said 19 years ago after being appointed to the federal court of justice , the country 's highest appellate court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel started out as ' kohl 's girl ' , but managed to elbow her way to the top a long way up born in 1946 in berlin , harms grew up in frankfurt am main and studied in heidelberg and hamburg .
she started her judicial career in 1974 as a prosecutor in hamburg , responsible for corporate crime .
afterward , she worked as a judge at the district court level and later at hamburg 's fiscal court before being appointed to the federal court of justice . a self-described conservative , harms has been described by her colleagues as a team player known for her integrity and a pragmatic approach to problem-solving .
and although she is a member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , she has never been known as a party hack . harms was considered a favorite candidate for the federal constitutional court , which will have two vacancies this year .

the statistics do n't look good . the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent .
and a 2006 report on equality by the european commission showed that the wage gap between men and women in germany widened by three percentage points in the past five years - german men earned on average 23 percent more income than women for equal work in 2004 . still , in the realm of politics and law , women have done better since german chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt to his cabinet in 1961 .
schröder had six women in his cabinet , merkel has five .
and women make up about one-third of parliament , up from 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equal opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s - especially a quota introduced by the greens reserving 50 percent of party seats and posts for women . still , most agree that as more and more women climb the ladder , society will get used to seeing them in top posts .

to walk into any german boardroom , high level political meeting or even news conference is to walk into a room filled mainly with men . then last year , angela merkel became germany 's first female chancellor and people mused over whether this might be a turning point for women in germany .
another first - the appointment of monika harms as the first female federal prosecutor general on tuesday - is making it look that way .

she started her judicial career in 1974 as a prosecutor in hamburg , responsible for corporate crime .
afterward , she worked as a judge at the district court level and later at hamburg 's fiscal court before being appointed to the federal court of justice . a self-described conservative , harms has been described by her colleagues as a team player known for her integrity and a pragmatic approach to problem-solving .
and although she is a member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , she has never been known as a party hack . harms was considered a favorite candidate for the federal constitutional court , which will have two vacancies this year .

the statistics do n't look good . the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent .
and a 2006 report on equality by the european commission showed that the wage gap between men and women in germany widened by three percentage points in the past five years - german men earned on average 23 percent more income than women for equal work in 2004 . still , in the realm of politics and law , women have done better since german chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt to his cabinet in 1961 .
schröder had six women in his cabinet , merkel has five .
and women make up about one-third of parliament , up from 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equal opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s - especially a quota introduced by the greens reserving 50 percent of party seats and posts for women . still , most agree that as more and more women climb the ladder , society will get used to seeing them in top posts .

to walk into any german boardroom , high level political meeting or even news conference is to walk into a room filled mainly with men . then last year , angela merkel became germany 's first female chancellor and people mused over whether this might be a turning point for women in germany .
another first - the appointment of monika harms as the first female federal prosecutor general on tuesday - is making it look that way . " i think that i provide an example that women can also reach the highest offices , " she said 19 years ago after being appointed to the federal court of justice , the country 's highest appellate court . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel started out as ' kohl 's girl ' , but managed to elbow her way to the top a long way up born in 1946 in berlin , harms grew up in frankfurt am main and studied in heidelberg and hamburg .
she started her judicial career in 1974 as a prosecutor in hamburg , responsible for corporate crime .
afterward , she worked as a judge at the district court level and later at hamburg 's fiscal court before being appointed to the federal court of justice . a self-described conservative , harms has been described by her colleagues as a team player known for her integrity and a pragmatic approach to problem-solving .
and although she is a member of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , she has never been known as a party hack . harms was considered a favorite candidate for the federal constitutional court , which will have two vacancies this year .
but she let it be known that she would rather have the top prosecutor job .
there , she will enter a boys ' club - following her predecessor kay nehm , who retired this week and who led a team that , for the last decade , has consisted of about 25 men . hope for others ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military and politics have opened to women - but boardrooms are largely closed but it 's doubtful whether harms ' appointment will signal a change in germany for women seeking to break through the glass ceiling .
the statistics do n't look good . the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent .
and a 2006 report on equality by the european commission showed that the wage gap between men and women in germany widened by three percentage points in the past five years - german men earned on average 23 percent more income than women for equal work in 2004 . still , in the realm of politics and law , women have done better since german chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt to his cabinet in 1961 .
schröder had six women in his cabinet , merkel has five .
and women make up about one-third of parliament , up from 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equal opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s - especially a quota introduced by the greens reserving 50 percent of party seats and posts for women . still , most agree that as more and more women climb the ladder , society will get used to seeing them in top posts .

the us said the data was needed to fight terrorism . the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- ruled that the decision to approve the data transfers , taken in may 2004 by eu governments and the european commission , was " founded on an inappropriate legal basis .

the appeal to the ecj was brought by the european parliament , which contended it had no legal basis and infringed fundamental rights . the ecj did not rule on whether the deal infringed on passengers ' privacy rights , but agreed with the parliament that it lacked an adequate legal basis . no immediate impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court did not rule on whether the deal violated privacy rights the ruling will not have any immediate impact on transatlantic air travel , as the court gave the european commission and member states four months to negotiate a new agreement .
the data transfers can continue until then . " the commission will consult the usa on any changes that may be required as a result of this judgment , " commission spokesman johannes laitenberger told a news briefing . the us also said it would seek a temporary way forward with the eu , but said transatlantic travel should not be disrupted , nor security lowered . european airlines said there should be no short-term implications for passengers because of the ruling . " what we understand is that it has been ruled out on a technicality and the commission has been given the opportunity to find another legal basis to satisfy the court , " said david henderson , spokesman for the association of european airlines . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu agrees to give u.s. air passenger data in a controversial deal , the eu has agreed to give u.s. authorities data on air travellers to the united states .

and it also planned to switch production at its existing amd fab 30 plant from 200-milimeter wafers to 300-milimeter wafers . boosting investment in the region amd has been in dresden in the eastern state of saxony since 1996 and employs about 2,800 people at two factories in the region .
the new projects will bring total investment in the region to more than eight billion dollars .
the investments highlight dresden 's status as one of the few relatively prosperous regions of eastern germany . amd said it would expand 300-mm capacity at the existing amd fab 36 plant and install a new clean room area to handle the site 's growing " bump and test " requirements - one of the final stages of the manufacturing process where wafers are prepared to be shipped for packaging . amd plans to ramp down 200-mm manufacturing in the second half of 2007 , with preparation already underway to ramp up 300-mm wafers on 65-nanometer process technology by the end of 2007 . " as global demand continues to rise for amd products , we are scaling our manufacturing capacity to meet our customers ' growing needs , " said amd chairman and chief executive , hector ruiz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd already enlarged the dresden site in 2004 " to achieve this , we are pursuing an aggressive path to invest in and expand our top-rated manufacturing capabilities in dresden .
these strategic investments highlight how significant germany and europe are to the future of amd competitiveness , " ruiz said . overall declining investment the $ 2.5 billion investment will create about 420 jobs , but hans deppe , general manager of amd 's dresden plant , said most of the money would go to machinery needed to produce the 300-mm wafers .
amd 's decision to expand in germany runs counter to an overall trend of falling levels of investment in europe 's largest economy . in 2004 , foreign investment in germany fell by 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 39 billion -rrb- , the first drop since 1992 , according to the united nations conference on trade and development , which tracks investment flows . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : an economic motor in the stalled east a new comparative study ranking economic dynamism in germany 's federal states has put saxony at the top of the list , setting it far apart from its eastern brethren , most of whose economies are barely limping along .

" there will always be the dodgy guy in the trench coat , " concedes garreth griffiths , head of trust and safety for ebay in the uk and ireland .
" this is one area where there will be fraud , just like any other market place " he admits .
even though a very small percentage of ebay trades proved fraudulent - the company reckons it around 0.01 % - they attract the publicity that threatens to undermine customer confidence .
experts or not ?
critics accuse ebay of an irresponsible " laissez-faire " approach that means they wash their hands of fraud until after the event .
but mr griffiths claims that the criticism is unjustified .
" its rather like a council and a high street , " he explains .
" we created the high street .
we do n't own the shops , we 're not the police , we do provide the infrastructure , we do have an immigration policy .
but there 's an element of responsibility for the people walking along the high street " . "
look at the trading record of the other party .
if there 's no information , i might contact the person and ask for a photograph and phone number " garreth griffiths , ebay what is your experience of ebay ?
mr griffiths denies ebay is passing the buck on to the public , and says the company lives up to its responsibilities as well .
ebay claims to work closely with the police , and employs an ex-scotland yard officer as a liaison point for law enforcement agencies .
it recently established a service , vero , for trademark owners to report fake items .
if a consumer company spots a counterfeit item for sale , ebay will remove the item .
" we are n't the experts , they are the experts , " mr griffiths explains .
" where they see fake goods , we 'll automatically take it down .
it 's completely free . "
clear threats the transparency of the transactions should provide extra comfort .
" ebay is a floodlit highway , it 's there for anyone to see 24 hours a day , there are no dark alleys where you can hide , " mr griffiths continued .
the growth of the ebay.co.uk website , the british version of its auction system , has been astonishing .
launched in october 1999 , the company says it hit the 15 million-customer milestone this month , with the site accounting for 10 % of all the time spent by british people on the net .
it says it is the most popular website in the uk , and that at any one time there are more than 3 million items for sale .
but it is the everpresent conmen who pose a threat to the site 's reputation .
perhaps the most high-profile was welsh teenager philip shortman , jailed last year for defrauding more than 100 customers , to fund a high rolling lifestyle .
calling him an " open blatant fraudster , who taunted his victims " , mr griffiths reckons there were lots of clues which should have alerted the public to the conman .
" he was using zero-feedback accounts , brand new sites with no trading history , " mr griffiths explained .
" the payment method was key as well ; he was using cheques which are difficult to trace . "
do as i do so how does mr griffiths avoid getting stung himself when he trades on ebay ?
he says the answer is to be streetwise .
" look at the trading record of the other party , " he says .
" if there 's no information , i might contact the person and ask for a photograph and phone number .
" i might say , i 'm about to spend £ 500 on your laptop , tell me about it .
if the answers are cagey , if he wo n't show the computer to me , i 'll walk away . "
the ultimate sanction open to mr griffiths is to throw crooked traders off the site .
a first offender might get a warning email .
" if he does it again , we might suspend him for a month .
if he persists we might end his account and call the police , " mr griffiths said .
mr griffiths hopes that his approach will increase the protection to customers , and root out the con artists .
he 's committed to reducing further the level of fraudulent sales on the site .
" that percentage will go down , " he pledges .
but i got the impression that not even he believes ebay can ever be completely fraud-free .

" there will always be the dodgy guy in the trench coat , " concedes garreth griffiths , head of trust and safety for ebay in the uk and ireland .
" this is one area where there will be fraud , just like any other market place " he admits .
even though a very small percentage of ebay trades proved fraudulent - the company reckons it around 0.01 % - they attract the publicity that threatens to undermine customer confidence .
experts or not ?
critics accuse ebay of an irresponsible " laissez-faire " approach that means they wash their hands of fraud until after the event .
but mr griffiths claims that the criticism is unjustified .
" its rather like a council and a high street , " he explains .
" we created the high street .
we do n't own the shops , we 're not the police , we do provide the infrastructure , we do have an immigration policy .
but there 's an element of responsibility for the people walking along the high street " .
look at the trading record of the other party .
if there 's no information , i might contact the person and ask for a photograph and phone number garreth griffiths , ebay what is your experience of ebay ?
mr griffiths denies ebay is passing the buck on to the public , and says the company lives up to its responsibilities as well .
ebay claims to work closely with the police , and employs an ex-scotland yard officer as a liaison point for law enforcement agencies .
it recently established a service , vero , for trademark owners to report fake items .
if a consumer company spots a counterfeit item for sale , ebay will remove the item .
" we are n't the experts , they are the experts , " mr griffiths explains .
" where they see fake goods , we 'll automatically take it down .
it 's completely free . "
clear threats the transparency of the transactions should provide extra comfort .
" ebay is a floodlit highway , it 's there for anyone to see 24 hours a day , there are no dark alleys where you can hide , " mr griffiths continued .
the growth of the ebay.co.uk website , the british version of its auction system , has been astonishing .
launched in october 1999 , the company says it hit the 15 million-customer milestone this month , with the site accounting for 10 % of all the time spent by british people on the net .
information can illuminate dark deals and scare off con-merchants it says it is the most popular website in the uk , and that at any one time there are more than 3 million items for sale .
but it is the everpresent conmen who pose a threat to the site 's reputation .
perhaps the most high-profile was welsh teenager philip shortman , jailed last year for defrauding more than 100 customers , to fund a high rolling lifestyle .
calling him an " open blatant fraudster , who taunted his victims " , mr griffiths reckons there were lots of clues which should have alerted the public to the conman .
" he was using zero-feedback accounts , brand new sites with no trading history , " mr griffiths explained .
" the payment method was key as well ; he was using cheques which are difficult to trace . "
do as i do so how does mr griffiths avoid getting stung himself when he trades on ebay ?
he says the answer is to be streetwise .
" look at the trading record of the other party , " he says .
" if there 's no information , i might contact the person and ask for a photograph and phone number .
" i might say , i 'm about to spend £ 500 on your laptop , tell me about it .
if the answers are cagey , if he wo n't show the computer to me , i 'll walk away . "
the ultimate sanction open to mr griffiths is to throw crooked traders off the site .
a first offender might get a warning email .
" if he does it again , we might suspend him for a month .
if he persists we might end his account and call the police , " mr griffiths said .
mr griffiths hopes that his approach will increase the protection to customers , and root out the con artists .
he 's committed to reducing further the level of fraudulent sales on the site .
" that percentage will go down , " he pledges .

growing concern the court said that a " severe sentence was unavoidable " after kim was found guilty of ordering his executives to inflate the group 's assets so that the company could get bank loans .
he also funnelled billions of dollars overseas .
daewoo started out as a small textile firm , bought by kim for $ 5,000 in 1967 .
from this simple beginning , kim turned daewoo into one of south korea 's most powerful industrial conglomerates , or " chaebols " , with close ties to other business leaders and top politicians at its height , daewoo employed 320,000 people in 110 countries .
but the company encountered problems in the 1990s after borrowing heavily to finance expansion .
the killer blow came with the asian financial crisis of 1997 and the company started to crumble .
under the microscope however , daewoo was not an isolated incident and a number of korean firms have found themselves in the spotlight over their finances .
earlier this month , south korean prosecutors indicted chung mong-koo , the chairman of carmaker hyundai motor for his alleged role in a bribery and embezzlement scandal .
mr chung , 68 , denies the charges that can carry jail sentences of up to life .

set in ireland in the 1920s it recounts events that led to the formation of an independent ireland and the creation of northern ireland .
loach 's aim is to cast his political eye on events that are rarely discussed in the uk and beyond and remain open wounds for many irish citizens .
cillian murphy plays damien , a young man set to leave ireland and become a doctor in london .
but events overtake him .
at the start of the film , ireland remains an effective colony of the uk ; with british soldiers stationed in the country .
damien witnesses the murder of a young friend , killed at the hands of brutal british soldiers because he would only give his name in gaelic , and not in english .
determinedly political as he prepares to depart for london , soldiers attack a train driver because they have been told by unions not to carry british military personnel .
encouraged by friends to fight the british he enlists in a small cell of irish republicans , part of the ira .
paul laverty 's script is one-eyed , and unashamedly so .
loach and laverty 's aim is determinedly political - to show an occupied country which rises up to throw off the yoke of an invading army .
it is a clear attempt to find resonance with events in iraq , with the us in the role of the empire clinging on to the past .
such lack of balance , however , results in a one-dimensional script .
the british are depicted as cardboard cut-out thugs and the motivation for the protagonists is delivered with a heavy hand when a lighter touch is needed .
the film works best when examining the emotional turbulence felt by ordinary irish men and women when they have to turn to armed struggle and murder .
in one scene the irish republican army attacks a british troop convoy and many of the republicans are visibly distressed with the deaths they have caused .
but the power of the scene evaporates when the soldiers return home only to find british troops attacking an irish farm and its female-only habitants as part of a search for ira members .
it clumsily absolves the characters of any guilt over their murderous actions and sets the tone for the subjective stance of the film .
fractious tensions murphy handles his role well - and wrings out depth from his character that is not written down on the page .
his sense of torture when forced to shoot an informer from his own ranks is both touching and the touchstone of the film .
the supporting cast of padraic delaney , liam cunningham and orla fitzgerald is also very strong .
the film loses its sense of purpose towards the end when loach and laverty examine the division within irish republicanism that led to brother against brother and family against family .
in one scene , characters reel off dull , political rhetoric .
it was intended as a glimpse into the fractious tensions of the time but feels rather more like a party political broadcast .
as one of several films at cannes which dealt squarely with war - and specifically aimed to make connections with the war in iraq and its aftermath - the wind that shakes the barley was the most straight-forwardly political .
loach has lamented that the events of the 1920s in ireland remain little known outside the country itself .
the palme d 'or win will ensure the film reaches a wider audience but it is disappointing that his cannes win comes for one of his weaker films .

set in ireland in the 1920s it recounts events that led to the formation of an independent ireland and the creation of northern ireland .
the wind that shakes the barley is set in 1920s ireland loach 's aim is to cast his political eye on events that are rarely discussed in the uk and beyond and remain open wounds for many irish citizens .
cillian murphy plays damien , a young man set to leave ireland and become a doctor in london .
but events overtake him .
at the start of the film , ireland remains an effective colony of the uk ; with british soldiers stationed in the country .
damien witnesses the murder of a young friend , killed at the hands of brutal british soldiers because he would only give his name in gaelic , and not in english .
determinedly political as he prepares to depart for london , soldiers attack a train driver because they have been told by unions not to carry british military personnel .
encouraged by friends to fight the british he enlists in a small cell of irish republicans , part of the ira .
paul laverty 's script is one-eyed , and unashamedly so .
loach and laverty 's aim is determinedly political - to show an occupied country which rises up to throw off the yoke of an invading army .
it is a clear attempt to find resonance with events in iraq , with the us in the role of the empire clinging on to the past .
such lack of balance , however , results in a one-dimensional script .
the british are depicted as cardboard cut-out thugs and the motivation for the protagonists is delivered with a heavy hand when a lighter touch is needed .
the film works best when examining the emotional turbulence felt by ordinary irish men and women when they have to turn to armed struggle and murder .
in one scene the irish republican army attacks a british troop convoy and many of the republicans are visibly distressed with the deaths they have caused .
but the power of the scene evaporates when the soldiers return home only to find british troops attacking an irish farm and its female-only habitants as part of a search for ira members .
the film heralded ken loach 's first palme d 'or win it clumsily absolves the characters of any guilt over their murderous actions and sets the tone for the subjective stance of the film .
fractious tensions murphy handles his role well - and wrings out depth from his character that is not written down on the page .
his sense of torture when forced to shoot an informer from his own ranks is both touching and the touchstone of the film .
the supporting cast of padraic delaney , liam cunningham and orla fitzgerald is also very strong .
the film loses its sense of purpose towards the end when loach and laverty examine the division within irish republicanism that led to brother against brother and family against family .
in one scene , characters reel off dull , political rhetoric .
it was intended as a glimpse into the fractious tensions of the time but feels rather more like a party political broadcast .
as one of several films at cannes which dealt squarely with war - and specifically aimed to make connections with the war in iraq and its aftermath - the wind that shakes the barley was the most straight-forwardly political .
loach has lamented that the events of the 1920s in ireland remain little known outside the country itself .
the palme d 'or win will ensure the film reaches a wider audience but it is disappointing that his cannes win comes for one of his weaker films .

set in ireland in the 1920s it recounts events that led to the formation of an independent ireland and the creation of northern ireland .
the wind that shakes the barley is set in 1920s ireland loach 's aim is to cast his political eye on events that are rarely discussed in the uk and beyond and remain open wounds for many irish citizens .
cillian murphy plays damien , a young man set to leave ireland and become a doctor in london .
but events overtake him .
at the start of the film , ireland remains an effective colony of the uk ; with british soldiers stationed in the country .
damien witnesses the murder of a young friend , killed at the hands of brutal british soldiers because he would only give his name in gaelic , and not in english .
determinedly political as he prepares to depart for london , soldiers attack a train driver because they have been told by unions not to carry british military personnel .
encouraged by friends to fight the british he enlists in a small cell of irish republicans , part of the ira .
paul laverty 's script is one-eyed , and unashamedly so .
loach and laverty 's aim is determinedly political - to show an occupied country which rises up to throw off the yoke of an invading army .
it is a clear attempt to find resonance with events in iraq , with the us in the role of the empire clinging on to the past .
such lack of balance , however , results in a one-dimensional script .
the british are depicted as cardboard cut-out thugs and the motivation for the protagonists is delivered with a heavy hand when a lighter touch is needed .
the film works best when examining the emotional turbulence felt by ordinary irish men and women when they have to turn to armed struggle and murder .
in one scene the irish republican army attacks a british troop convoy and many of the republicans are visibly distressed with the deaths they have caused .
but the power of the scene evaporates when the soldiers return home only to find british troops attacking an irish farm and its female-only habitants as part of a search for ira members .
the film heralded ken loach 's first palme d 'or win it clumsily absolves the characters of any guilt over their murderous actions and sets the tone for the subjective stance of the film .
fractious tensions murphy handles his role well - and wrings out depth from his character that is not written down on the page .
his sense of torture when forced to shoot an informer from his own ranks is both touching and the touchstone of the film .
the supporting cast of padraic delaney , liam cunningham and orla fitzgerald is also very strong .
the film loses its sense of purpose towards the end when loach and laverty examine the division within irish republicanism that led to brother against brother and family against family .
in one scene , characters reel off dull , political rhetoric .
it was intended as a glimpse into the fractious tensions of the time but feels rather more like a party political broadcast .
as one of several films at cannes which dealt squarely with war - and specifically aimed to make connections with the war in iraq and its aftermath - the wind that shakes the barley was the most straight-forwardly political .

she said she had to be optimistic as a writer - and was optimistic about the future of the human race .
there were , she added , " hopeful signs " of improvement in the world , referring obliquely to al gore 's lecture on global warming later that day .
she also said writers had to believe their work " will go somewhere and that you wo n't just cack out in the middle " .
the author , an " old favourite " of the mid-wales festival , said : " we have the intelligence to dig ourselves out of the muddy field we seem to have sunken into . "
" when i am talking to young writers i say there has to be some blood in the cookie " margaret atwood but , she added , she would stop short of designing her own utopia .
" there 's a problem with utopian thinking .
you can design your perfect world but there is always going to be someone who does n't agree with you .
" what do you do with them ? "
continue down that route and , she warned , you end up with " dystopia - a much worse situation " .
the author - whose most famous novels include the handmaid 's tale - read extracts from her new work the tent , which she describes as short fiction .
it includes passages which seem of a more personal nature than her past work , including a poem called bring back mom : an incantation , referring back to atwood 's childhood in the 1940s .
she described the tent as " a kind of liquorice all-sorts " .
" everything you write has always got something of you in it because it has passed through you , " she said .
" when i am talking to young writers i say there has to be some blood in the cookie . "
' breathtakingly bad ' she also described her bad habits - too much gardening in the summer and having trouble " sitting and beginning -lsb- to write -rsb- " .
atwood confessed she was an addicted reader : " i will read anything about attila the hun , anything on the black death , lots of new fiction , lots of old fiction . "
among the old fiction , she admitted to a liking for the english classics .
" i 'm very fond of milton ... and an even more shameful admission i 'm fond of tennyson - not all his poems , some of which are breathtakingly bad , but others are brilliant . "
