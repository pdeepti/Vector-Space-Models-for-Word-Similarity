program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.01.2006 world bank report says migration highly lucrative großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants often contribute to two economies immigration is n't just about integration , but also big money .
a new world bank report says migrant workers send billions to their families back home - strengthening local economies as well as helping rich countries . the world bank says migration is here to stay , so nations around the world should try to get the most out of it . in its annual report called " global economic prospects for 2006 , " the world bank estimates that 200 million people work abroad . dílip rátha , a senior economist at the world bank and co-author of the " global economic prospects for 2006 " report said migration was set to rise in the future . " looking 20 years ahead , it is almost certain that there will be more migration .
in the rich countries , we have the problem of aging populations .
all of these old people are going to need care ...
and then you have the number of people in africa and poor countries exploding , and they are going to need jobs , " said ratha . " at some point , these push and pull factors have to come together ... and unfortunately , we have not prepared ourselves for this new world where there will be so much migration .
the whole idea of living with migrant population has to be incorporated into the current lifestyle . " reducing poverty through remittances ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrantion in germany is often discussed in terms of integration rátha said most discussions about migration focus on social and political issues , such as integration , yet the world bank reports that 90 percent of all people who migrate do so for economic reasons .
in the fiscal scheme of things , nearly everyone wins . " in the year 2005 , international migrants sent $ 167 billion dollars to developing counties in the form of remittances , " said ratha .
" india , mexico and the philippines were the three largest recipients of remittances in dollar terms , but in percentages of gdp , remittances were largest in smaller economies like tonga , lesotho and moldova . " the world bank expert said that remittances by immigrant workers are a way of reducing poverty and strengthening economies in developing countries . in fact , many developing countries receive twice as much money through funds sent by their nationals working abroad than through development aid , the report points out .
remittances even compose the greatest source of outside income for some countries . beneficial to host nations too but , it 's not just their native countries that benefit from the cash influx .
even the host nations reap advantages . " over time , because these migrants have arrived in the countries , they contribute to the economy , because they produce things , and they produce services , the size of the economy increases over time and there is more growth in the economy , and in the end , everybody benefits , including the natives themselves , " ratha said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even seasonal workers contribute to their economy back home so foreign workers can contribute to economic growth in wealthy nations , while also helping to reduce poverty back home .
but there are a couple of preconditions , said ratha . inflation must be low in developing countries for remittances to have a positive effect .
high fees for fiscal transfers must be kept to a minimum .
and there is one significant drawback : less wealthy countries lose skilled employees when they go abroad . louisa schaefer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study highlights migration 's bright side among increasing fear of worldwide migration , a new study emphasizes migrants ' key role in fostering global economic growth .

he ran the modern day equivalent of a delicatessen on the ground floor of the house ; the mozart family rented an apartment on the third floor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a plaque designates mozart 's birthplace in salzburg it was there on jan .

in 2006 , the 250th anniversary of his birth , about half a million visitors are expected - a good opportunity for the mozart family apartment to be spruced up . the international mozarteum foundation decided to give it a new look and commissioned texan-born stage director and designer robert wilson to create an installation of light and sounds to enhance many of the original objects on display .
the installation " a space for mozart " is intended to remain in place after the anniversary year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us artist and theater director robert wilson wilson first visited mozart ’ s birthplace over a year ago and was surprised to see how many families with small children came to see the apartment .
for that reason , he wanted to create an installation that would appeal particularly to young people .
he began by studying the architectural layout of the apartment to try and understand how the rooms were originally used . light in music wilson ’ s opera productions are characterized by his fascinating lighting effects .
in re-designing the mozart apartment , light plays a major role .
wilson said he found inspiration from the light he senses in mozart ’ s music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson 's installation gives a contemporary feel to the historical objects on display " his work appears on the surface to be something very simple , but at the same time it ’ s very complex , " wilson said .
" that ’ s something that fascinates me in the work of mozart .
secondly , the body of the work is the light that he creates , the mental light , the mental landscape , and one could say the virtual light .
that ’ s very different from wagner , puccini .
it ’ s a special light i associate with the music , with the requiem , the magic flute . " in the apartment 's bedroom , wilson conjured up a flock of blue geese , flying towards the window and the open space beyond – a very different way to express the birth of a genius . " robert wilson took all the original functions of the rooms and involved it in his concept , and in this middle room , the bedroom , there is now an atmosphere of setting off , " said gabriele ramsauer , director of the mozart museum .
" there are geese flying towards a window and you feel that something special must have happened many years ago .
this is the main thing i wanted to convey to people who come to this house . " playful approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's clavichord is the focus of one room original objects that belonged to mozart such as his viola and the violin he played as a child are still on display , but instead of having them simply housed inside a glass case , wilson has turned their viewing into a sort of playful hide-and-seek , ramsauer said . " they are a little bit hidden in the walls with round panels of glass , and there are also jokes and surprised in this exhibition , " she said .
" wilson wanted to show that mozart was a humorous person who loved jokes . " wilson 's installation incorporates all the rooms of the mozarts ' apartment in the yellow house on the getreidegasse .
through his poetic , imaginative approach to the museum , wilson hopes that visitors will experience mozart - the man and the music - in an entirely new way . mozart 's birthplace in the getreidegasse , central salzburg , is open every day , including sundays and public holidays , from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m , and in july and august until 7:00 p.m. dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating a quarter-millennium of mozart 2006 is the 250th anniversary of wolfgang amadeus mozart 's birth , and classical europe is looking to party .

" people should have a place set aside for prayer , meditation and a silent time , " said the priest helmut bauer . only passages from the bible and psalms were read , and loudspeakers relayed the service from the packed church to mourners outside . the 15 victims were aged between seven and 40 .

" we have announced that we are ready to start work as early as tomorrow and it 's now down to the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency to be ready too , " ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said sunday . " we are in close contact with the agency , iaea inspectors came out recently , " asefi told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea is awaiting further information before making its next move .
on saturday , iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said the watchdog had received a first letter from iran about its intentions but added that its inspectors needed more information before being able to proceed . " it did not satisfy our information requirements , we still need information in more details , " she said , adding that the watchdog was expecting a further letter from the iranians . as iran 's suspension of nuclear research was voluntary , the presence of iaea inspectors for the resumption is not a requirement under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , a diplomat close to the watchdog acknowledged . but iran 's top security body , which first announced the research resumption last tuesday , has made clear it wants to work with the watchdog . " our research activities will be under the supervision of the agency 's cameras , " its spokesman hossein entezami told afp saturday . iran splits hairs over research and enrichment iran has been trying to make a distinction between research into the nuclear fuel cycle and actual production of enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civil reactors or , in highly enriched form , as the explosive core of an atom bomb . but washington , which suspects tehran of using its civil nuclear program as a cover for weapons development , warned it would regard any resumption of research as proof that iran was not serious about negotiations to allay western concerns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice says the us sees the move as an unwillingness to make diplomacy work .
" they should n't do it because it would really be a sign that they are not prepared to actually make diplomacy work , " secretary of state condoleezza rice said thursday . she warned that a draft resolution had already been prepared to put before the security council in the event that the avenues for negotiation had been exhausted . eu fears time for talk is nearing its end the european union , which has been trying to reopen talks suspended in august after iran rejected an initial set of incentives to abandon enrichment , voiced dismay at the imminent resumption of research . " the eu regrets that iran has chosen to announce this unilateral move at a moment when international confidence in the peaceful nature of its program is far from restored , " a statement said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has urged iran not to begin research again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 08.01.2006 more room for foreigners in bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no german limits on european players like dutch striker roy makaay managers ' opinions are divided on a change to the german soccer rule limiting how many non-eu players a team can have .
some say it will help the game , others contend it will only benefit top clubs . soccer coaches may be well known for their ability to calculate exactly how many points they need to advance to a tournament 's next round or avoid relegation , but keeping track of the number of foreign players they have on the field is not always their forte . one of the worst mathematical mix-ups occurred in the 1992/93 season , when stuttgart 's then coach christoph daum substituted serbian jovica simanic into a champions league match against leeds , accidentally putting one too many foreigners on the field . stuttgart won the game 3:0 that night , but judges turned around the decision because of the infraction , and stuttgart were eliminated from the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the bundesliga 's most successful foreigner , brazil 's giovanne elber handed in his gladbach jersey in december starting next season coaches will no longer need to make their players ' names with flags when determining the line up , and the entire brazilian team could take field for kaiserslautern - if the bundesliga 's last-placed team were able to put together enough money to pay them . a rule change , which came during a late december meeting of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , will exchange the current four-player limit on non-uefa players with other rules to promote player development programs . big clubs in favor , smaller ones undecided bayern munich and werder bremen , two german teams in the champions league , had repeatedly called for reform to the foreigner rule in the past .
bayern manager uli hoeneß was especially critical of the rule he said hurt german clubs ' chances in european competition . " a german player has to be of good quality , not fulfill a quota , " he said .
" we can not keep the portion of germans up with artificial rules , otherwise we make ourselves weaker internationally . " heribert bruchhagen , head of the much smaller club eintracht frankfurt , said the new rule would only benefit the biggest , richest clubs , while the small ones remain left with the job of training young players because they ca n't afford more established stars . " the gap between the big and small clubs is only going to get wider , and the german players ' position is not strengthened , " he said .
" this rule is bad for german soccer . " new rules promote youth training programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfl wants to encourage training for home-grown players like miroslav klose the dfl , however , also implemented the uefa 's local player rule , which it said will make sure bundesliga teams are motivated to train younger players . the local player rule demands each club have at least four locally trained players .
players between 15 and 21 who have been with a club for at least three years qualify as locally trained . though the bundesliga 's locally trained players need not be german , each team is additionally required to have at least 12 german players on its roster .
that 's a part of the new plan mönchengladbach 's youth trainer max eberl said fits well with developing german talent . " it fits with our philosophy and is also a sign of appreciation for the clubs with good youth programs , " he said , before adding that gladbach plan to fill about a third of the team with players from their development program . the dfl said the new rules would hardly be noticeable to all but the most detail-oriented observers . " we do not fear any serious changes to the proportion of foreigners in the bundesliga , " dfl spokesperson christian pfennig said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the day european soccer began ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .

" " the eu regrets that iran has chosen to announce this unilateral move at a moment when international confidence in the peaceful nature of its program is far from restored , " it added . " it finds it surprising and unreasonable that iran proposes to do this at a moment when ...
britain , france and germany with the eu were exploring with iran the possibility of a return to negotiations .

" nuclear research to resume next week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : against the wishes of the eu and the us , research will begin again after a two-year hiatus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 08.01.2006 more room for foreigners in bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no german limits on european players like dutch striker roy makaay managers ' opinions are divided on a change to the german soccer rule limiting how many non-eu players a team can have .
some say it will help the game , others contend it will only benefit top clubs . soccer coaches may be well known for their ability to calculate exactly how many points they need to advance to a tournament 's next round or avoid relegation , but keeping track of the number of foreign players they have on the field is not always their forte . one of the worst mathematical mix-ups occurred in the 1992/93 season , when stuttgart 's then coach christoph daum substituted serbian jovica simanic into a champions league match against leeds , accidentally putting one too many foreigners on the field . stuttgart won the game 3:0 that night , but judges turned around the decision because of the infraction , and stuttgart were eliminated from the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the bundesliga 's most successful foreigner , brazil 's giovanne elber handed in his gladbach jersey in december starting next season coaches will no longer need to make their players ' names with flags when determining the line up , and the entire brazilian team could take field for kaiserslautern - if the bundesliga 's last-placed team were able to put together enough money to pay them . a rule change , which came during a late december meeting of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , will exchange the current four-player limit on non-uefa players with other rules to promote player development programs . big clubs in favor , smaller ones undecided bayern munich and werder bremen , two german teams in the champions league , had repeatedly called for reform to the foreigner rule in the past .
bayern manager uli hoeneß was especially critical of the rule he said hurt german clubs ' chances in european competition . " a german player has to be of good quality , not fulfill a quota , " he said .
" we can not keep the portion of germans up with artificial rules , otherwise we make ourselves weaker internationally . " heribert bruchhagen , head of the much smaller club eintracht frankfurt , said the new rule would only benefit the biggest , richest clubs , while the small ones remain left with the job of training young players because they ca n't afford more established stars . " the gap between the big and small clubs is only going to get wider , and the german players ' position is not strengthened , " he said .
" this rule is bad for german soccer . " new rules promote youth training programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfl wants to encourage training for home-grown players like miroslav klose the dfl , however , also implemented the uefa 's local player rule , which it said will make sure bundesliga teams are motivated to train younger players . the local player rule demands each club have at least four locally trained players .
players between 15 and 21 who have been with a club for at least three years qualify as locally trained . though the bundesliga 's locally trained players need not be german , each team is additionally required to have at least 12 german players on its roster .
that 's a part of the new plan mönchengladbach 's youth trainer max eberl said fits well with developing german talent .

some say it will help the game , others contend it will only benefit top clubs . soccer coaches may be well known for their ability to calculate exactly how many points they need to advance to a tournament 's next round or avoid relegation , but keeping track of the number of foreign players they have on the field is not always their forte . one of the worst mathematical mix-ups occurred in the 1992/93 season , when stuttgart 's then coach christoph daum substituted serbian jovica simanic into a champions league match against leeds , accidentally putting one too many foreigners on the field . stuttgart won the game 3:0 that night , but judges turned around the decision because of the infraction , and stuttgart were eliminated from the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the bundesliga 's most successful foreigner , brazil 's giovanne elber handed in his gladbach jersey in december starting next season coaches will no longer need to make their players ' names with flags when determining the line up , and the entire brazilian team could take field for kaiserslautern - if the bundesliga 's last-placed team were able to put together enough money to pay them . a rule change , which came during a late december meeting of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , will exchange the current four-player limit on non-uefa players with other rules to promote player development programs . big clubs in favor , smaller ones undecided bayern munich and werder bremen , two german teams in the champions league , had repeatedly called for reform to the foreigner rule in the past .

" we can not keep the portion of germans up with artificial rules , otherwise we make ourselves weaker internationally .

players between 15 and 21 who have been with a club for at least three years qualify as locally trained . though the bundesliga 's locally trained players need not be german , each team is additionally required to have at least 12 german players on its roster .

" " the eu regrets that iran has chosen to announce this unilateral move at a moment when international confidence in the peaceful nature of its program is far from restored , " it added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 08.01.2006 more room for foreigners in bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no german limits on european players like dutch striker roy makaay managers ' opinions are divided on a change to the german soccer rule limiting how many non-eu players a team can have .
some say it will help the game , others contend it will only benefit top clubs . soccer coaches may be well known for their ability to calculate exactly how many points they need to advance to a tournament 's next round or avoid relegation , but keeping track of the number of foreign players they have on the field is not always their forte . one of the worst mathematical mix-ups occurred in the 1992/93 season , when stuttgart 's then coach christoph daum substituted serbian jovica simanic into a champions league match against leeds , accidentally putting one too many foreigners on the field . stuttgart won the game 3:0 that night , but judges turned around the decision because of the infraction , and stuttgart were eliminated from the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the bundesliga 's most successful foreigner , brazil 's giovanne elber handed in his gladbach jersey in december starting next season coaches will no longer need to make their players ' names with flags when determining the line up , and the entire brazilian team could take field for kaiserslautern - if the bundesliga 's last-placed team were able to put together enough money to pay them . a rule change , which came during a late december meeting of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , will exchange the current four-player limit on non-uefa players with other rules to promote player development programs . big clubs in favor , smaller ones undecided bayern munich and werder bremen , two german teams in the champions league , had repeatedly called for reform to the foreigner rule in the past .
bayern manager uli hoeneß was especially critical of the rule he said hurt german clubs ' chances in european competition . " a german player has to be of good quality , not fulfill a quota , " he said .
" we can not keep the portion of germans up with artificial rules , otherwise we make ourselves weaker internationally . " heribert bruchhagen , head of the much smaller club eintracht frankfurt , said the new rule would only benefit the biggest , richest clubs , while the small ones remain left with the job of training young players because they ca n't afford more established stars . " the gap between the big and small clubs is only going to get wider , and the german players ' position is not strengthened , " he said .
" this rule is bad for german soccer . " new rules promote youth training programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfl wants to encourage training for home-grown players like miroslav klose the dfl , however , also implemented the uefa 's local player rule , which it said will make sure bundesliga teams are motivated to train younger players . the local player rule demands each club have at least four locally trained players .
players between 15 and 21 who have been with a club for at least three years qualify as locally trained . though the bundesliga 's locally trained players need not be german , each team is additionally required to have at least 12 german players on its roster .
that 's a part of the new plan mönchengladbach 's youth trainer max eberl said fits well with developing german talent . " it fits with our philosophy and is also a sign of appreciation for the clubs with good youth programs , " he said , before adding that gladbach plan to fill about a third of the team with players from their development program . the dfl said the new rules would hardly be noticeable to all but the most detail-oriented observers . " we do not fear any serious changes to the proportion of foreigners in the bundesliga , " dfl spokesperson christian pfennig said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the day european soccer began ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 08.01.2006 more room for foreigners in bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no german limits on european players like dutch striker roy makaay managers ' opinions are divided on a change to the german soccer rule limiting how many non-eu players a team can have .
some say it will help the game , others contend it will only benefit top clubs . soccer coaches may be well known for their ability to calculate exactly how many points they need to advance to a tournament 's next round or avoid relegation , but keeping track of the number of foreign players they have on the field is not always their forte . one of the worst mathematical mix-ups occurred in the 1992/93 season , when stuttgart 's then coach christoph daum substituted serbian jovica simanic into a champions league match against leeds , accidentally putting one too many foreigners on the field . stuttgart won the game 3:0 that night , but judges turned around the decision because of the infraction , and stuttgart were eliminated from the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the bundesliga 's most successful foreigner , brazil 's giovanne elber handed in his gladbach jersey in december starting next season coaches will no longer need to make their players ' names with flags when determining the line up , and the entire brazilian team could take field for kaiserslautern - if the bundesliga 's last-placed team were able to put together enough money to pay them . a rule change , which came during a late december meeting of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , will exchange the current four-player limit on non-uefa players with other rules to promote player development programs . big clubs in favor , smaller ones undecided bayern munich and werder bremen , two german teams in the champions league , had repeatedly called for reform to the foreigner rule in the past .
bayern manager uli hoeneß was especially critical of the rule he said hurt german clubs ' chances in european competition . " a german player has to be of good quality , not fulfill a quota , " he said .
" we can not keep the portion of germans up with artificial rules , otherwise we make ourselves weaker internationally . " heribert bruchhagen , head of the much smaller club eintracht frankfurt , said the new rule would only benefit the biggest , richest clubs , while the small ones remain left with the job of training young players because they ca n't afford more established stars . " the gap between the big and small clubs is only going to get wider , and the german players ' position is not strengthened , " he said .
" this rule is bad for german soccer . " new rules promote youth training programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfl wants to encourage training for home-grown players like miroslav klose the dfl , however , also implemented the uefa 's local player rule , which it said will make sure bundesliga teams are motivated to train younger players . the local player rule demands each club have at least four locally trained players .
players between 15 and 21 who have been with a club for at least three years qualify as locally trained . though the bundesliga 's locally trained players need not be german , each team is additionally required to have at least 12 german players on its roster .
that 's a part of the new plan mönchengladbach 's youth trainer max eberl said fits well with developing german talent . " it fits with our philosophy and is also a sign of appreciation for the clubs with good youth programs , " he said , before adding that gladbach plan to fill about a third of the team with players from their development program . the dfl said the new rules would hardly be noticeable to all but the most detail-oriented observers . " we do not fear any serious changes to the proportion of foreigners in the bundesliga , " dfl spokesperson christian pfennig said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the day european soccer began ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .

" people should have a place set aside for prayer , meditation and a silent time , " said the priest helmut bauer . only passages from the bible and psalms were read , and loudspeakers relayed the service from the packed church to mourners outside . the 15 victims were aged between seven and 40 .
they included three women , five teenagers , and seven children aged between seven and 12 .
a further 36 people were injured . meanwhile , weekly news magazine der spiegel , set to hit newsstands on monday , is reporting that the building 's structural weaknesses may have led to its collapse . the magazine quotes an engineer who examined the rubble of the building several hours after the accident , and who noted an absence of sealed joints on at least five of the 20 places where the wooden structure buckled . these weak points could have been the cause of the roof 's collapse , says der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disaster was attributed to structural defects currently under investigation .
the roof of the rink , built in 1971 , was largely flat and was weighed down by at least 180 tons of thick snow when it collapsed on monday just before the rink was due to close . the magazine said the roof 's poor state had been known for some time . an inquiry is looking into the causes of the accident . saturday 's service also remembered three skiers who died in an avalanche near the town on monday , the day of the disaster at the ice rink . bavarian state premier stoiber mourns with families the service was attended by edmund stoiber , president of the state of bavaria in which the town is situated , and by relatives of those who died and by rescue workers . german president horst köhler was to have attended but according to bauer bad weather prevented his aircraft from landing at salzburg , in austria , nearby . but he was due to travel to bad reichenhall via munich during the day to sign a book of condolences . an official ceremony will be held tuesday and will be attended by several members of the government . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ice rink death toll rises to 15 police have begun a criminal investigation into the collapse of an ice skating rink roof in the southern german town of bad reichenhall , which took the lives of 15 people , including 12 children .

" we have announced that we are ready to start work as early as tomorrow and it 's now down to the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency to be ready too , " ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said sunday . " we are in close contact with the agency , iaea inspectors came out recently , " asefi told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea is awaiting further information before making its next move .
on saturday , iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said the watchdog had received a first letter from iran about its intentions but added that its inspectors needed more information before being able to proceed . " it did not satisfy our information requirements , we still need information in more details , " she said , adding that the watchdog was expecting a further letter from the iranians . as iran 's suspension of nuclear research was voluntary , the presence of iaea inspectors for the resumption is not a requirement under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , a diplomat close to the watchdog acknowledged . but iran 's top security body , which first announced the research resumption last tuesday , has made clear it wants to work with the watchdog . " our research activities will be under the supervision of the agency 's cameras , " its spokesman hossein entezami told afp saturday . iran splits hairs over research and enrichment iran has been trying to make a distinction between research into the nuclear fuel cycle and actual production of enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civil reactors or , in highly enriched form , as the explosive core of an atom bomb . but washington , which suspects tehran of using its civil nuclear program as a cover for weapons development , warned it would regard any resumption of research as proof that iran was not serious about negotiations to allay western concerns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice says the us sees the move as an unwillingness to make diplomacy work .
" they should n't do it because it would really be a sign that they are not prepared to actually make diplomacy work , " secretary of state condoleezza rice said thursday . she warned that a draft resolution had already been prepared to put before the security council in the event that the avenues for negotiation had been exhausted . eu fears time for talk is nearing its end the european union , which has been trying to reopen talks suspended in august after iran rejected an initial set of incentives to abandon enrichment , voiced dismay at the imminent resumption of research . " the eu regrets that iran has chosen to announce this unilateral move at a moment when international confidence in the peaceful nature of its program is far from restored , " a statement said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has urged iran not to begin research again .

" they are a little bit hidden in the walls with round panels of glass , and there are also jokes and surprised in this exhibition , " she said .
" wilson wanted to show that mozart was a humorous person who loved jokes . " wilson 's installation incorporates all the rooms of the mozarts ' apartment in the yellow house on the getreidegasse .
through his poetic , imaginative approach to the museum , wilson hopes that visitors will experience mozart - the man and the music - in an entirely new way . mozart 's birthplace in the getreidegasse , central salzburg , is open every day , including sundays and public holidays , from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m , and in july and august until 7:00 p.m. dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating a quarter-millennium of mozart 2006 is the 250th anniversary of wolfgang amadeus mozart 's birth , and classical europe is looking to party .

just outside house no. 9 , the street opens out onto hagenauer platz , the square named after the mozart family ’ s landlord , lorenz hagenauer .
he ran the modern day equivalent of a delicatessen on the ground floor of the house ; the mozart family rented an apartment on the third floor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a plaque designates mozart 's birthplace in salzburg it was there on jan .
27th , 1756 , that anna maria mozart gave birth to a baby boy : johannes chrysostomus wolfgangus theophilus – wolfgang amadé mozart . in an average year , about 400,000 people visit mozart ’ s birthplace in the heart of salzburg .
in 2006 , the 250th anniversary of his birth , about half a million visitors are expected - a good opportunity for the mozart family apartment to be spruced up . the international mozarteum foundation decided to give it a new look and commissioned texan-born stage director and designer robert wilson to create an installation of light and sounds to enhance many of the original objects on display .
the installation " a space for mozart " is intended to remain in place after the anniversary year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us artist and theater director robert wilson wilson first visited mozart ’ s birthplace over a year ago and was surprised to see how many families with small children came to see the apartment .
for that reason , he wanted to create an installation that would appeal particularly to young people .
he began by studying the architectural layout of the apartment to try and understand how the rooms were originally used . light in music wilson ’ s opera productions are characterized by his fascinating lighting effects .
in re-designing the mozart apartment , light plays a major role .
wilson said he found inspiration from the light he senses in mozart ’ s music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson 's installation gives a contemporary feel to the historical objects on display " his work appears on the surface to be something very simple , but at the same time it ’ s very complex , " wilson said .
" that ’ s something that fascinates me in the work of mozart .
secondly , the body of the work is the light that he creates , the mental light , the mental landscape , and one could say the virtual light .
that ’ s very different from wagner , puccini .
it ’ s a special light i associate with the music , with the requiem , the magic flute . " in the apartment 's bedroom , wilson conjured up a flock of blue geese , flying towards the window and the open space beyond – a very different way to express the birth of a genius . " robert wilson took all the original functions of the rooms and involved it in his concept , and in this middle room , the bedroom , there is now an atmosphere of setting off , " said gabriele ramsauer , director of the mozart museum .

some say it will help the game , others contend it will only benefit top clubs . soccer coaches may be well known for their ability to calculate exactly how many points they need to advance to a tournament 's next round or avoid relegation , but keeping track of the number of foreign players they have on the field is not always their forte . one of the worst mathematical mix-ups occurred in the 1992/93 season , when stuttgart 's then coach christoph daum substituted serbian jovica simanic into a champions league match against leeds , accidentally putting one too many foreigners on the field . stuttgart won the game 3:0 that night , but judges turned around the decision because of the infraction , and stuttgart were eliminated from the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the bundesliga 's most successful foreigner , brazil 's giovanne elber handed in his gladbach jersey in december starting next season coaches will no longer need to make their players ' names with flags when determining the line up , and the entire brazilian team could take field for kaiserslautern - if the bundesliga 's last-placed team were able to put together enough money to pay them . a rule change , which came during a late december meeting of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , will exchange the current four-player limit on non-uefa players with other rules to promote player development programs . big clubs in favor , smaller ones undecided bayern munich and werder bremen , two german teams in the champions league , had repeatedly called for reform to the foreigner rule in the past .
bayern manager uli hoeneß was especially critical of the rule he said hurt german clubs ' chances in european competition . " a german player has to be of good quality , not fulfill a quota , " he said .
" we can not keep the portion of germans up with artificial rules , otherwise we make ourselves weaker internationally . " heribert bruchhagen , head of the much smaller club eintracht frankfurt , said the new rule would only benefit the biggest , richest clubs , while the small ones remain left with the job of training young players because they ca n't afford more established stars . " the gap between the big and small clubs is only going to get wider , and the german players ' position is not strengthened , " he said .
" this rule is bad for german soccer . " new rules promote youth training programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfl wants to encourage training for home-grown players like miroslav klose the dfl , however , also implemented the uefa 's local player rule , which it said will make sure bundesliga teams are motivated to train younger players . the local player rule demands each club have at least four locally trained players .
players between 15 and 21 who have been with a club for at least three years qualify as locally trained . though the bundesliga 's locally trained players need not be german , each team is additionally required to have at least 12 german players on its roster .
that 's a part of the new plan mönchengladbach 's youth trainer max eberl said fits well with developing german talent . " it fits with our philosophy and is also a sign of appreciation for the clubs with good youth programs , " he said , before adding that gladbach plan to fill about a third of the team with players from their development program . the dfl said the new rules would hardly be noticeable to all but the most detail-oriented observers .

" people should have a place set aside for prayer , meditation and a silent time , " said the priest helmut bauer . only passages from the bible and psalms were read , and loudspeakers relayed the service from the packed church to mourners outside . the 15 victims were aged between seven and 40 .
they included three women , five teenagers , and seven children aged between seven and 12 .
a further 36 people were injured . meanwhile , weekly news magazine der spiegel , set to hit newsstands on monday , is reporting that the building 's structural weaknesses may have led to its collapse . the magazine quotes an engineer who examined the rubble of the building several hours after the accident , and who noted an absence of sealed joints on at least five of the 20 places where the wooden structure buckled . these weak points could have been the cause of the roof 's collapse , says der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disaster was attributed to structural defects currently under investigation .
the roof of the rink , built in 1971 , was largely flat and was weighed down by at least 180 tons of thick snow when it collapsed on monday just before the rink was due to close . the magazine said the roof 's poor state had been known for some time . an inquiry is looking into the causes of the accident . saturday 's service also remembered three skiers who died in an avalanche near the town on monday , the day of the disaster at the ice rink . bavarian state premier stoiber mourns with families the service was attended by edmund stoiber , president of the state of bavaria in which the town is situated , and by relatives of those who died and by rescue workers . german president horst köhler was to have attended but according to bauer bad weather prevented his aircraft from landing at salzburg , in austria , nearby . but he was due to travel to bad reichenhall via munich during the day to sign a book of condolences . an official ceremony will be held tuesday and will be attended by several members of the government . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ice rink death toll rises to 15 police have begun a criminal investigation into the collapse of an ice skating rink roof in the southern german town of bad reichenhall , which took the lives of 15 people , including 12 children .

" we have announced that we are ready to start work as early as tomorrow and it 's now down to the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency to be ready too , " ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said sunday . " we are in close contact with the agency , iaea inspectors came out recently , " asefi told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea is awaiting further information before making its next move .
on saturday , iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said the watchdog had received a first letter from iran about its intentions but added that its inspectors needed more information before being able to proceed . " it did not satisfy our information requirements , we still need information in more details , " she said , adding that the watchdog was expecting a further letter from the iranians . as iran 's suspension of nuclear research was voluntary , the presence of iaea inspectors for the resumption is not a requirement under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , a diplomat close to the watchdog acknowledged . but iran 's top security body , which first announced the research resumption last tuesday , has made clear it wants to work with the watchdog . " our research activities will be under the supervision of the agency 's cameras , " its spokesman hossein entezami told afp saturday . iran splits hairs over research and enrichment iran has been trying to make a distinction between research into the nuclear fuel cycle and actual production of enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civil reactors or , in highly enriched form , as the explosive core of an atom bomb . but washington , which suspects tehran of using its civil nuclear program as a cover for weapons development , warned it would regard any resumption of research as proof that iran was not serious about negotiations to allay western concerns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice says the us sees the move as an unwillingness to make diplomacy work .
" they should n't do it because it would really be a sign that they are not prepared to actually make diplomacy work , " secretary of state condoleezza rice said thursday . she warned that a draft resolution had already been prepared to put before the security council in the event that the avenues for negotiation had been exhausted . eu fears time for talk is nearing its end the european union , which has been trying to reopen talks suspended in august after iran rejected an initial set of incentives to abandon enrichment , voiced dismay at the imminent resumption of research . " the eu regrets that iran has chosen to announce this unilateral move at a moment when international confidence in the peaceful nature of its program is far from restored , " a statement said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has urged iran not to begin research again .
" it finds it surprising and unreasonable that iran proposes to do this at a moment when ...
britain , france and germany with the eu were exploring with iran the possibility of a return to negotiations . " russia working to broker a deal with eu , us blessing with backing from both the european union and the united states , russia had been canvassing a compromise under which iran could carry out its own uranium enrichment but on russian soil . a high level delegation has been in tehran since friday evening to discuss the proposals and asefi said the talks were going well . " the negotiating process is positive and has the potential to produce effective proposals , " he said sunday . his assessment was a sharp improvement on comments he made tuesday in which he complained of " ambiguities " in the plan .
" it 's not a structured proposal it is still an idea , we have to discuss it , " he had said then . iran wants any deal to recognize its right under the npt to conduct enrichment on its own territory . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu opposes iranian move on nuclear research iran has said it will resume its nuclear research activities next week , despite western opposition .

" we have announced that we are ready to start work as early as tomorrow and it 's now down to the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency to be ready too , " ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said sunday . " we are in close contact with the agency , iaea inspectors came out recently , " asefi told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea is awaiting further information before making its next move .
on saturday , iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said the watchdog had received a first letter from iran about its intentions but added that its inspectors needed more information before being able to proceed . " it did not satisfy our information requirements , we still need information in more details , " she said , adding that the watchdog was expecting a further letter from the iranians . as iran 's suspension of nuclear research was voluntary , the presence of iaea inspectors for the resumption is not a requirement under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , a diplomat close to the watchdog acknowledged . but iran 's top security body , which first announced the research resumption last tuesday , has made clear it wants to work with the watchdog . " our research activities will be under the supervision of the agency 's cameras , " its spokesman hossein entezami told afp saturday . iran splits hairs over research and enrichment iran has been trying to make a distinction between research into the nuclear fuel cycle and actual production of enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civil reactors or , in highly enriched form , as the explosive core of an atom bomb . but washington , which suspects tehran of using its civil nuclear program as a cover for weapons development , warned it would regard any resumption of research as proof that iran was not serious about negotiations to allay western concerns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice says the us sees the move as an unwillingness to make diplomacy work .
" they should n't do it because it would really be a sign that they are not prepared to actually make diplomacy work , " secretary of state condoleezza rice said thursday . she warned that a draft resolution had already been prepared to put before the security council in the event that the avenues for negotiation had been exhausted . eu fears time for talk is nearing its end the european union , which has been trying to reopen talks suspended in august after iran rejected an initial set of incentives to abandon enrichment , voiced dismay at the imminent resumption of research . " the eu regrets that iran has chosen to announce this unilateral move at a moment when international confidence in the peaceful nature of its program is far from restored , " a statement said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has urged iran not to begin research again .

just outside house no. 9 , the street opens out onto hagenauer platz , the square named after the mozart family ’ s landlord , lorenz hagenauer .
he ran the modern day equivalent of a delicatessen on the ground floor of the house ; the mozart family rented an apartment on the third floor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a plaque designates mozart 's birthplace in salzburg it was there on jan .

in 2006 , the 250th anniversary of his birth , about half a million visitors are expected - a good opportunity for the mozart family apartment to be spruced up . the international mozarteum foundation decided to give it a new look and commissioned texan-born stage director and designer robert wilson to create an installation of light and sounds to enhance many of the original objects on display .
the installation " a space for mozart " is intended to remain in place after the anniversary year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us artist and theater director robert wilson wilson first visited mozart ’ s birthplace over a year ago and was surprised to see how many families with small children came to see the apartment .
for that reason , he wanted to create an installation that would appeal particularly to young people .
he began by studying the architectural layout of the apartment to try and understand how the rooms were originally used . light in music wilson ’ s opera productions are characterized by his fascinating lighting effects .
in re-designing the mozart apartment , light plays a major role .
wilson said he found inspiration from the light he senses in mozart ’ s music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson 's installation gives a contemporary feel to the historical objects on display " his work appears on the surface to be something very simple , but at the same time it ’ s very complex , " wilson said .
" that ’ s something that fascinates me in the work of mozart .
secondly , the body of the work is the light that he creates , the mental light , the mental landscape , and one could say the virtual light .
that ’ s very different from wagner , puccini .
it ’ s a special light i associate with the music , with the requiem , the magic flute . " in the apartment 's bedroom , wilson conjured up a flock of blue geese , flying towards the window and the open space beyond – a very different way to express the birth of a genius . " robert wilson took all the original functions of the rooms and involved it in his concept , and in this middle room , the bedroom , there is now an atmosphere of setting off , " said gabriele ramsauer , director of the mozart museum .
" there are geese flying towards a window and you feel that something special must have happened many years ago .
this is the main thing i wanted to convey to people who come to this house . " playful approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's clavichord is the focus of one room original objects that belonged to mozart such as his viola and the violin he played as a child are still on display , but instead of having them simply housed inside a glass case , wilson has turned their viewing into a sort of playful hide-and-seek , ramsauer said . " they are a little bit hidden in the walls with round panels of glass , and there are also jokes and surprised in this exhibition , " she said .
" wilson wanted to show that mozart was a humorous person who loved jokes . " wilson 's installation incorporates all the rooms of the mozarts ' apartment in the yellow house on the getreidegasse .
through his poetic , imaginative approach to the museum , wilson hopes that visitors will experience mozart - the man and the music - in an entirely new way . mozart 's birthplace in the getreidegasse , central salzburg , is open every day , including sundays and public holidays , from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m , and in july and august until 7:00 p.m. dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating a quarter-millennium of mozart 2006 is the 250th anniversary of wolfgang amadeus mozart 's birth , and classical europe is looking to party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 08.01.2006 more room for foreigners in bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no german limits on european players like dutch striker roy makaay managers ' opinions are divided on a change to the german soccer rule limiting how many non-eu players a team can have .
some say it will help the game , others contend it will only benefit top clubs . soccer coaches may be well known for their ability to calculate exactly how many points they need to advance to a tournament 's next round or avoid relegation , but keeping track of the number of foreign players they have on the field is not always their forte . one of the worst mathematical mix-ups occurred in the 1992/93 season , when stuttgart 's then coach christoph daum substituted serbian jovica simanic into a champions league match against leeds , accidentally putting one too many foreigners on the field . stuttgart won the game 3:0 that night , but judges turned around the decision because of the infraction , and stuttgart were eliminated from the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the bundesliga 's most successful foreigner , brazil 's giovanne elber handed in his gladbach jersey in december starting next season coaches will no longer need to make their players ' names with flags when determining the line up , and the entire brazilian team could take field for kaiserslautern - if the bundesliga 's last-placed team were able to put together enough money to pay them . a rule change , which came during a late december meeting of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , will exchange the current four-player limit on non-uefa players with other rules to promote player development programs . big clubs in favor , smaller ones undecided bayern munich and werder bremen , two german teams in the champions league , had repeatedly called for reform to the foreigner rule in the past .
bayern manager uli hoeneß was especially critical of the rule he said hurt german clubs ' chances in european competition . " a german player has to be of good quality , not fulfill a quota , " he said .
" we can not keep the portion of germans up with artificial rules , otherwise we make ourselves weaker internationally . " heribert bruchhagen , head of the much smaller club eintracht frankfurt , said the new rule would only benefit the biggest , richest clubs , while the small ones remain left with the job of training young players because they ca n't afford more established stars . " the gap between the big and small clubs is only going to get wider , and the german players ' position is not strengthened , " he said .
" this rule is bad for german soccer . " new rules promote youth training programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfl wants to encourage training for home-grown players like miroslav klose the dfl , however , also implemented the uefa 's local player rule , which it said will make sure bundesliga teams are motivated to train younger players . the local player rule demands each club have at least four locally trained players .
players between 15 and 21 who have been with a club for at least three years qualify as locally trained . though the bundesliga 's locally trained players need not be german , each team is additionally required to have at least 12 german players on its roster .
that 's a part of the new plan mönchengladbach 's youth trainer max eberl said fits well with developing german talent . " it fits with our philosophy and is also a sign of appreciation for the clubs with good youth programs , " he said , before adding that gladbach plan to fill about a third of the team with players from their development program . the dfl said the new rules would hardly be noticeable to all but the most detail-oriented observers . " we do not fear any serious changes to the proportion of foreigners in the bundesliga , " dfl spokesperson christian pfennig said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the day european soccer began ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.01.2006 world bank report says migration highly lucrative großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants often contribute to two economies immigration is n't just about integration , but also big money .
a new world bank report says migrant workers send billions to their families back home - strengthening local economies as well as helping rich countries . the world bank says migration is here to stay , so nations around the world should try to get the most out of it . in its annual report called " global economic prospects for 2006 , " the world bank estimates that 200 million people work abroad . dílip rátha , a senior economist at the world bank and co-author of the " global economic prospects for 2006 " report said migration was set to rise in the future . " looking 20 years ahead , it is almost certain that there will be more migration .
in the rich countries , we have the problem of aging populations .
all of these old people are going to need care ...
and then you have the number of people in africa and poor countries exploding , and they are going to need jobs , " said ratha . " at some point , these push and pull factors have to come together ... and unfortunately , we have not prepared ourselves for this new world where there will be so much migration .
the whole idea of living with migrant population has to be incorporated into the current lifestyle . " reducing poverty through remittances ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrantion in germany is often discussed in terms of integration rátha said most discussions about migration focus on social and political issues , such as integration , yet the world bank reports that 90 percent of all people who migrate do so for economic reasons .
in the fiscal scheme of things , nearly everyone wins . " in the year 2005 , international migrants sent $ 167 billion dollars to developing counties in the form of remittances , " said ratha .
" india , mexico and the philippines were the three largest recipients of remittances in dollar terms , but in percentages of gdp , remittances were largest in smaller economies like tonga , lesotho and moldova . " the world bank expert said that remittances by immigrant workers are a way of reducing poverty and strengthening economies in developing countries . in fact , many developing countries receive twice as much money through funds sent by their nationals working abroad than through development aid , the report points out .
remittances even compose the greatest source of outside income for some countries . beneficial to host nations too but , it 's not just their native countries that benefit from the cash influx .
even the host nations reap advantages . " over time , because these migrants have arrived in the countries , they contribute to the economy , because they produce things , and they produce services , the size of the economy increases over time and there is more growth in the economy , and in the end , everybody benefits , including the natives themselves , " ratha said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even seasonal workers contribute to their economy back home so foreign workers can contribute to economic growth in wealthy nations , while also helping to reduce poverty back home .
but there are a couple of preconditions , said ratha . inflation must be low in developing countries for remittances to have a positive effect .
high fees for fiscal transfers must be kept to a minimum .
and there is one significant drawback : less wealthy countries lose skilled employees when they go abroad . louisa schaefer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study highlights migration 's bright side among increasing fear of worldwide migration , a new study emphasizes migrants ' key role in fostering global economic growth .

in 2006 , the 250th anniversary of his birth , about half a million visitors are expected - a good opportunity for the mozart family apartment to be spruced up . the international mozarteum foundation decided to give it a new look and commissioned texan-born stage director and designer robert wilson to create an installation of light and sounds to enhance many of the original objects on display .
the installation " a space for mozart " is intended to remain in place after the anniversary year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us artist and theater director robert wilson wilson first visited mozart ’ s birthplace over a year ago and was surprised to see how many families with small children came to see the apartment .
for that reason , he wanted to create an installation that would appeal particularly to young people .
he began by studying the architectural layout of the apartment to try and understand how the rooms were originally used . light in music wilson ’ s opera productions are characterized by his fascinating lighting effects .
in re-designing the mozart apartment , light plays a major role .
wilson said he found inspiration from the light he senses in mozart ’ s music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson 's installation gives a contemporary feel to the historical objects on display " his work appears on the surface to be something very simple , but at the same time it ’ s very complex , " wilson said .
" that ’ s something that fascinates me in the work of mozart .
secondly , the body of the work is the light that he creates , the mental light , the mental landscape , and one could say the virtual light .
that ’ s very different from wagner , puccini .
it ’ s a special light i associate with the music , with the requiem , the magic flute . " in the apartment 's bedroom , wilson conjured up a flock of blue geese , flying towards the window and the open space beyond – a very different way to express the birth of a genius . " robert wilson took all the original functions of the rooms and involved it in his concept , and in this middle room , the bedroom , there is now an atmosphere of setting off , " said gabriele ramsauer , director of the mozart museum .
" there are geese flying towards a window and you feel that something special must have happened many years ago .
this is the main thing i wanted to convey to people who come to this house . " playful approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's clavichord is the focus of one room original objects that belonged to mozart such as his viola and the violin he played as a child are still on display , but instead of having them simply housed inside a glass case , wilson has turned their viewing into a sort of playful hide-and-seek , ramsauer said . " they are a little bit hidden in the walls with round panels of glass , and there are also jokes and surprised in this exhibition , " she said .
" wilson wanted to show that mozart was a humorous person who loved jokes . " wilson 's installation incorporates all the rooms of the mozarts ' apartment in the yellow house on the getreidegasse .
through his poetic , imaginative approach to the museum , wilson hopes that visitors will experience mozart - the man and the music - in an entirely new way . mozart 's birthplace in the getreidegasse , central salzburg , is open every day , including sundays and public holidays , from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m , and in july and august until 7:00 p.m. dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating a quarter-millennium of mozart 2006 is the 250th anniversary of wolfgang amadeus mozart 's birth , and classical europe is looking to party .

27th , 1756 , that anna maria mozart gave birth to a baby boy : johannes chrysostomus wolfgangus theophilus – wolfgang amadé mozart . in an average year , about 400,000 people visit mozart ’ s birthplace in the heart of salzburg .
in 2006 , the 250th anniversary of his birth , about half a million visitors are expected - a good opportunity for the mozart family apartment to be spruced up . the international mozarteum foundation decided to give it a new look and commissioned texan-born stage director and designer robert wilson to create an installation of light and sounds to enhance many of the original objects on display .
the installation " a space for mozart " is intended to remain in place after the anniversary year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us artist and theater director robert wilson wilson first visited mozart ’ s birthplace over a year ago and was surprised to see how many families with small children came to see the apartment .
for that reason , he wanted to create an installation that would appeal particularly to young people .
he began by studying the architectural layout of the apartment to try and understand how the rooms were originally used . light in music wilson ’ s opera productions are characterized by his fascinating lighting effects .
in re-designing the mozart apartment , light plays a major role .
wilson said he found inspiration from the light he senses in mozart ’ s music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson 's installation gives a contemporary feel to the historical objects on display " his work appears on the surface to be something very simple , but at the same time it ’ s very complex , " wilson said .
" that ’ s something that fascinates me in the work of mozart .
secondly , the body of the work is the light that he creates , the mental light , the mental landscape , and one could say the virtual light .
that ’ s very different from wagner , puccini .
it ’ s a special light i associate with the music , with the requiem , the magic flute . " in the apartment 's bedroom , wilson conjured up a flock of blue geese , flying towards the window and the open space beyond – a very different way to express the birth of a genius . " robert wilson took all the original functions of the rooms and involved it in his concept , and in this middle room , the bedroom , there is now an atmosphere of setting off , " said gabriele ramsauer , director of the mozart museum .
" there are geese flying towards a window and you feel that something special must have happened many years ago .
this is the main thing i wanted to convey to people who come to this house . " playful approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart 's clavichord is the focus of one room original objects that belonged to mozart such as his viola and the violin he played as a child are still on display , but instead of having them simply housed inside a glass case , wilson has turned their viewing into a sort of playful hide-and-seek , ramsauer said . " they are a little bit hidden in the walls with round panels of glass , and there are also jokes and surprised in this exhibition , " she said .
" wilson wanted to show that mozart was a humorous person who loved jokes . " wilson 's installation incorporates all the rooms of the mozarts ' apartment in the yellow house on the getreidegasse .
through his poetic , imaginative approach to the museum , wilson hopes that visitors will experience mozart - the man and the music - in an entirely new way . mozart 's birthplace in the getreidegasse , central salzburg , is open every day , including sundays and public holidays , from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m , and in july and august until 7:00 p.m. dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrating a quarter-millennium of mozart 2006 is the 250th anniversary of wolfgang amadeus mozart 's birth , and classical europe is looking to party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 08.01.2006 world bank report says migration highly lucrative großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrants often contribute to two economies immigration is n't just about integration , but also big money .
a new world bank report says migrant workers send billions to their families back home - strengthening local economies as well as helping rich countries . the world bank says migration is here to stay , so nations around the world should try to get the most out of it . in its annual report called " global economic prospects for 2006 , " the world bank estimates that 200 million people work abroad . dílip rátha , a senior economist at the world bank and co-author of the " global economic prospects for 2006 " report said migration was set to rise in the future . " looking 20 years ahead , it is almost certain that there will be more migration .
in the rich countries , we have the problem of aging populations .
all of these old people are going to need care ...
and then you have the number of people in africa and poor countries exploding , and they are going to need jobs , " said ratha . " at some point , these push and pull factors have to come together ... and unfortunately , we have not prepared ourselves for this new world where there will be so much migration .
the whole idea of living with migrant population has to be incorporated into the current lifestyle . " reducing poverty through remittances ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrantion in germany is often discussed in terms of integration rátha said most discussions about migration focus on social and political issues , such as integration , yet the world bank reports that 90 percent of all people who migrate do so for economic reasons .
in the fiscal scheme of things , nearly everyone wins . " in the year 2005 , international migrants sent $ 167 billion dollars to developing counties in the form of remittances , " said ratha .
" india , mexico and the philippines were the three largest recipients of remittances in dollar terms , but in percentages of gdp , remittances were largest in smaller economies like tonga , lesotho and moldova . " the world bank expert said that remittances by immigrant workers are a way of reducing poverty and strengthening economies in developing countries . in fact , many developing countries receive twice as much money through funds sent by their nationals working abroad than through development aid , the report points out .
remittances even compose the greatest source of outside income for some countries . beneficial to host nations too but , it 's not just their native countries that benefit from the cash influx .
even the host nations reap advantages . " over time , because these migrants have arrived in the countries , they contribute to the economy , because they produce things , and they produce services , the size of the economy increases over time and there is more growth in the economy , and in the end , everybody benefits , including the natives themselves , " ratha said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even seasonal workers contribute to their economy back home so foreign workers can contribute to economic growth in wealthy nations , while also helping to reduce poverty back home .
but there are a couple of preconditions , said ratha . inflation must be low in developing countries for remittances to have a positive effect .

" people should have a place set aside for prayer , meditation and a silent time , " said the priest helmut bauer . only passages from the bible and psalms were read , and loudspeakers relayed the service from the packed church to mourners outside . the 15 victims were aged between seven and 40 .
they included three women , five teenagers , and seven children aged between seven and 12 .
a further 36 people were injured . meanwhile , weekly news magazine der spiegel , set to hit newsstands on monday , is reporting that the building 's structural weaknesses may have led to its collapse . the magazine quotes an engineer who examined the rubble of the building several hours after the accident , and who noted an absence of sealed joints on at least five of the 20 places where the wooden structure buckled . these weak points could have been the cause of the roof 's collapse , says der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the disaster was attributed to structural defects currently under investigation .
the roof of the rink , built in 1971 , was largely flat and was weighed down by at least 180 tons of thick snow when it collapsed on monday just before the rink was due to close . the magazine said the roof 's poor state had been known for some time . an inquiry is looking into the causes of the accident . saturday 's service also remembered three skiers who died in an avalanche near the town on monday , the day of the disaster at the ice rink . bavarian state premier stoiber mourns with families the service was attended by edmund stoiber , president of the state of bavaria in which the town is situated , and by relatives of those who died and by rescue workers . german president horst köhler was to have attended but according to bauer bad weather prevented his aircraft from landing at salzburg , in austria , nearby . but he was due to travel to bad reichenhall via munich during the day to sign a book of condolences . an official ceremony will be held tuesday and will be attended by several members of the government . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ice rink death toll rises to 15 police have begun a criminal investigation into the collapse of an ice skating rink roof in the southern german town of bad reichenhall , which took the lives of 15 people , including 12 children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 08.01.2006 more room for foreigners in bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no german limits on european players like dutch striker roy makaay managers ' opinions are divided on a change to the german soccer rule limiting how many non-eu players a team can have .
some say it will help the game , others contend it will only benefit top clubs . soccer coaches may be well known for their ability to calculate exactly how many points they need to advance to a tournament 's next round or avoid relegation , but keeping track of the number of foreign players they have on the field is not always their forte . one of the worst mathematical mix-ups occurred in the 1992/93 season , when stuttgart 's then coach christoph daum substituted serbian jovica simanic into a champions league match against leeds , accidentally putting one too many foreigners on the field . stuttgart won the game 3:0 that night , but judges turned around the decision because of the infraction , and stuttgart were eliminated from the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the bundesliga 's most successful foreigner , brazil 's giovanne elber handed in his gladbach jersey in december starting next season coaches will no longer need to make their players ' names with flags when determining the line up , and the entire brazilian team could take field for kaiserslautern - if the bundesliga 's last-placed team were able to put together enough money to pay them . a rule change , which came during a late december meeting of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , will exchange the current four-player limit on non-uefa players with other rules to promote player development programs . big clubs in favor , smaller ones undecided bayern munich and werder bremen , two german teams in the champions league , had repeatedly called for reform to the foreigner rule in the past .
bayern manager uli hoeneß was especially critical of the rule he said hurt german clubs ' chances in european competition . " a german player has to be of good quality , not fulfill a quota , " he said .
" we can not keep the portion of germans up with artificial rules , otherwise we make ourselves weaker internationally . " heribert bruchhagen , head of the much smaller club eintracht frankfurt , said the new rule would only benefit the biggest , richest clubs , while the small ones remain left with the job of training young players because they ca n't afford more established stars . " the gap between the big and small clubs is only going to get wider , and the german players ' position is not strengthened , " he said .
" this rule is bad for german soccer . " new rules promote youth training programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfl wants to encourage training for home-grown players like miroslav klose the dfl , however , also implemented the uefa 's local player rule , which it said will make sure bundesliga teams are motivated to train younger players . the local player rule demands each club have at least four locally trained players .
players between 15 and 21 who have been with a club for at least three years qualify as locally trained . though the bundesliga 's locally trained players need not be german , each team is additionally required to have at least 12 german players on its roster .
that 's a part of the new plan mönchengladbach 's youth trainer max eberl said fits well with developing german talent . " it fits with our philosophy and is also a sign of appreciation for the clubs with good youth programs , " he said , before adding that gladbach plan to fill about a third of the team with players from their development program . the dfl said the new rules would hardly be noticeable to all but the most detail-oriented observers . " we do not fear any serious changes to the proportion of foreigners in the bundesliga , " dfl spokesperson christian pfennig said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the day european soccer began ten years ago this week , the european court of justice handed down a ruling that revolutionized european soccer .

" we have announced that we are ready to start work as early as tomorrow and it 's now down to the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency to be ready too , " ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said sunday . " we are in close contact with the agency , iaea inspectors came out recently , " asefi told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea is awaiting further information before making its next move .
on saturday , iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said the watchdog had received a first letter from iran about its intentions but added that its inspectors needed more information before being able to proceed . " it did not satisfy our information requirements , we still need information in more details , " she said , adding that the watchdog was expecting a further letter from the iranians . as iran 's suspension of nuclear research was voluntary , the presence of iaea inspectors for the resumption is not a requirement under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , a diplomat close to the watchdog acknowledged . but iran 's top security body , which first announced the research resumption last tuesday , has made clear it wants to work with the watchdog . " our research activities will be under the supervision of the agency 's cameras , " its spokesman hossein entezami told afp saturday . iran splits hairs over research and enrichment iran has been trying to make a distinction between research into the nuclear fuel cycle and actual production of enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civil reactors or , in highly enriched form , as the explosive core of an atom bomb . but washington , which suspects tehran of using its civil nuclear program as a cover for weapons development , warned it would regard any resumption of research as proof that iran was not serious about negotiations to allay western concerns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice says the us sees the move as an unwillingness to make diplomacy work .
" they should n't do it because it would really be a sign that they are not prepared to actually make diplomacy work , " secretary of state condoleezza rice said thursday . she warned that a draft resolution had already been prepared to put before the security council in the event that the avenues for negotiation had been exhausted . eu fears time for talk is nearing its end the european union , which has been trying to reopen talks suspended in august after iran rejected an initial set of incentives to abandon enrichment , voiced dismay at the imminent resumption of research .

a new world bank report says migrant workers send billions to their families back home - strengthening local economies as well as helping rich countries . the world bank says migration is here to stay , so nations around the world should try to get the most out of it . in its annual report called " global economic prospects for 2006 , " the world bank estimates that 200 million people work abroad . dílip rátha , a senior economist at the world bank and co-author of the " global economic prospects for 2006 " report said migration was set to rise in the future . " looking 20 years ahead , it is almost certain that there will be more migration .
in the rich countries , we have the problem of aging populations .
all of these old people are going to need care ...
and then you have the number of people in africa and poor countries exploding , and they are going to need jobs , " said ratha . " at some point , these push and pull factors have to come together ... and unfortunately , we have not prepared ourselves for this new world where there will be so much migration .
the whole idea of living with migrant population has to be incorporated into the current lifestyle . " reducing poverty through remittances ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrantion in germany is often discussed in terms of integration rátha said most discussions about migration focus on social and political issues , such as integration , yet the world bank reports that 90 percent of all people who migrate do so for economic reasons .
in the fiscal scheme of things , nearly everyone wins . " in the year 2005 , international migrants sent $ 167 billion dollars to developing counties in the form of remittances , " said ratha .
" india , mexico and the philippines were the three largest recipients of remittances in dollar terms , but in percentages of gdp , remittances were largest in smaller economies like tonga , lesotho and moldova . " the world bank expert said that remittances by immigrant workers are a way of reducing poverty and strengthening economies in developing countries . in fact , many developing countries receive twice as much money through funds sent by their nationals working abroad than through development aid , the report points out .
remittances even compose the greatest source of outside income for some countries . beneficial to host nations too but , it 's not just their native countries that benefit from the cash influx .
even the host nations reap advantages . " over time , because these migrants have arrived in the countries , they contribute to the economy , because they produce things , and they produce services , the size of the economy increases over time and there is more growth in the economy , and in the end , everybody benefits , including the natives themselves , " ratha said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even seasonal workers contribute to their economy back home so foreign workers can contribute to economic growth in wealthy nations , while also helping to reduce poverty back home .
but there are a couple of preconditions , said ratha . inflation must be low in developing countries for remittances to have a positive effect .
high fees for fiscal transfers must be kept to a minimum .
and there is one significant drawback : less wealthy countries lose skilled employees when they go abroad . louisa schaefer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study highlights migration 's bright side among increasing fear of worldwide migration , a new study emphasizes migrants ' key role in fostering global economic growth .

a new world bank report says migrant workers send billions to their families back home - strengthening local economies as well as helping rich countries . the world bank says migration is here to stay , so nations around the world should try to get the most out of it . in its annual report called " global economic prospects for 2006 , " the world bank estimates that 200 million people work abroad . dílip rátha , a senior economist at the world bank and co-author of the " global economic prospects for 2006 " report said migration was set to rise in the future . " looking 20 years ahead , it is almost certain that there will be more migration .
in the rich countries , we have the problem of aging populations .
all of these old people are going to need care ...
and then you have the number of people in africa and poor countries exploding , and they are going to need jobs , " said ratha . " at some point , these push and pull factors have to come together ... and unfortunately , we have not prepared ourselves for this new world where there will be so much migration .
the whole idea of living with migrant population has to be incorporated into the current lifestyle . " reducing poverty through remittances ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrantion in germany is often discussed in terms of integration rátha said most discussions about migration focus on social and political issues , such as integration , yet the world bank reports that 90 percent of all people who migrate do so for economic reasons .
in the fiscal scheme of things , nearly everyone wins . " in the year 2005 , international migrants sent $ 167 billion dollars to developing counties in the form of remittances , " said ratha .
" india , mexico and the philippines were the three largest recipients of remittances in dollar terms , but in percentages of gdp , remittances were largest in smaller economies like tonga , lesotho and moldova .

some say it will help the game , others contend it will only benefit top clubs . soccer coaches may be well known for their ability to calculate exactly how many points they need to advance to a tournament 's next round or avoid relegation , but keeping track of the number of foreign players they have on the field is not always their forte . one of the worst mathematical mix-ups occurred in the 1992/93 season , when stuttgart 's then coach christoph daum substituted serbian jovica simanic into a champions league match against leeds , accidentally putting one too many foreigners on the field . stuttgart won the game 3:0 that night , but judges turned around the decision because of the infraction , and stuttgart were eliminated from the tournament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once the bundesliga 's most successful foreigner , brazil 's giovanne elber handed in his gladbach jersey in december starting next season coaches will no longer need to make their players ' names with flags when determining the line up , and the entire brazilian team could take field for kaiserslautern - if the bundesliga 's last-placed team were able to put together enough money to pay them . a rule change , which came during a late december meeting of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , will exchange the current four-player limit on non-uefa players with other rules to promote player development programs . big clubs in favor , smaller ones undecided bayern munich and werder bremen , two german teams in the champions league , had repeatedly called for reform to the foreigner rule in the past .
bayern manager uli hoeneß was especially critical of the rule he said hurt german clubs ' chances in european competition . " a german player has to be of good quality , not fulfill a quota , " he said .
" we can not keep the portion of germans up with artificial rules , otherwise we make ourselves weaker internationally .

" we have announced that we are ready to start work as early as tomorrow and it 's now down to the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency to be ready too , " ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said sunday . " we are in close contact with the agency , iaea inspectors came out recently , " asefi told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea is awaiting further information before making its next move .
on saturday , iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said the watchdog had received a first letter from iran about its intentions but added that its inspectors needed more information before being able to proceed . " it did not satisfy our information requirements , we still need information in more details , " she said , adding that the watchdog was expecting a further letter from the iranians . as iran 's suspension of nuclear research was voluntary , the presence of iaea inspectors for the resumption is not a requirement under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , a diplomat close to the watchdog acknowledged . but iran 's top security body , which first announced the research resumption last tuesday , has made clear it wants to work with the watchdog . " our research activities will be under the supervision of the agency 's cameras , " its spokesman hossein entezami told afp saturday . iran splits hairs over research and enrichment iran has been trying to make a distinction between research into the nuclear fuel cycle and actual production of enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civil reactors or , in highly enriched form , as the explosive core of an atom bomb . but washington , which suspects tehran of using its civil nuclear program as a cover for weapons development , warned it would regard any resumption of research as proof that iran was not serious about negotiations to allay western concerns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice says the us sees the move as an unwillingness to make diplomacy work .
" they should n't do it because it would really be a sign that they are not prepared to actually make diplomacy work , " secretary of state condoleezza rice said thursday . she warned that a draft resolution had already been prepared to put before the security council in the event that the avenues for negotiation had been exhausted . eu fears time for talk is nearing its end the european union , which has been trying to reopen talks suspended in august after iran rejected an initial set of incentives to abandon enrichment , voiced dismay at the imminent resumption of research . " the eu regrets that iran has chosen to announce this unilateral move at a moment when international confidence in the peaceful nature of its program is far from restored , " a statement said saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has urged iran not to begin research again .
" it finds it surprising and unreasonable that iran proposes to do this at a moment when ...
britain , france and germany with the eu were exploring with iran the possibility of a return to negotiations . " russia working to broker a deal with eu , us blessing with backing from both the european union and the united states , russia had been canvassing a compromise under which iran could carry out its own uranium enrichment but on russian soil . a high level delegation has been in tehran since friday evening to discuss the proposals and asefi said the talks were going well . " the negotiating process is positive and has the potential to produce effective proposals , " he said sunday . his assessment was a sharp improvement on comments he made tuesday in which he complained of " ambiguities " in the plan .
" it 's not a structured proposal it is still an idea , we have to discuss it , " he had said then . iran wants any deal to recognize its right under the npt to conduct enrichment on its own territory . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu opposes iranian move on nuclear research iran has said it will resume its nuclear research activities next week , despite western opposition .

" we have announced that we are ready to start work as early as tomorrow and it 's now down to the -lrb- international atomic energy -rrb- agency to be ready too , " ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi said sunday . " we are in close contact with the agency , iaea inspectors came out recently , " asefi told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea is awaiting further information before making its next move .
on saturday , iaea spokeswoman melissa fleming said the watchdog had received a first letter from iran about its intentions but added that its inspectors needed more information before being able to proceed . " it did not satisfy our information requirements , we still need information in more details , " she said , adding that the watchdog was expecting a further letter from the iranians . as iran 's suspension of nuclear research was voluntary , the presence of iaea inspectors for the resumption is not a requirement under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , a diplomat close to the watchdog acknowledged . but iran 's top security body , which first announced the research resumption last tuesday , has made clear it wants to work with the watchdog . " our research activities will be under the supervision of the agency 's cameras , " its spokesman hossein entezami told afp saturday . iran splits hairs over research and enrichment iran has been trying to make a distinction between research into the nuclear fuel cycle and actual production of enriched uranium , which can be used as fuel in civil reactors or , in highly enriched form , as the explosive core of an atom bomb . but washington , which suspects tehran of using its civil nuclear program as a cover for weapons development , warned it would regard any resumption of research as proof that iran was not serious about negotiations to allay western concerns . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice says the us sees the move as an unwillingness to make diplomacy work .

a new world bank report says migrant workers send billions to their families back home - strengthening local economies as well as helping rich countries . the world bank says migration is here to stay , so nations around the world should try to get the most out of it . in its annual report called " global economic prospects for 2006 , " the world bank estimates that 200 million people work abroad . dílip rátha , a senior economist at the world bank and co-author of the " global economic prospects for 2006 " report said migration was set to rise in the future . " looking 20 years ahead , it is almost certain that there will be more migration .
in the rich countries , we have the problem of aging populations .
all of these old people are going to need care ...
and then you have the number of people in africa and poor countries exploding , and they are going to need jobs , " said ratha .

in the fiscal scheme of things , nearly everyone wins . " in the year 2005 , international migrants sent $ 167 billion dollars to developing counties in the form of remittances , " said ratha .
" india , mexico and the philippines were the three largest recipients of remittances in dollar terms , but in percentages of gdp , remittances were largest in smaller economies like tonga , lesotho and moldova . " the world bank expert said that remittances by immigrant workers are a way of reducing poverty and strengthening economies in developing countries . in fact , many developing countries receive twice as much money through funds sent by their nationals working abroad than through development aid , the report points out .
remittances even compose the greatest source of outside income for some countries . beneficial to host nations too but , it 's not just their native countries that benefit from the cash influx .
even the host nations reap advantages . " over time , because these migrants have arrived in the countries , they contribute to the economy , because they produce things , and they produce services , the size of the economy increases over time and there is more growth in the economy , and in the end , everybody benefits , including the natives themselves , " ratha said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even seasonal workers contribute to their economy back home so foreign workers can contribute to economic growth in wealthy nations , while also helping to reduce poverty back home .
but there are a couple of preconditions , said ratha . inflation must be low in developing countries for remittances to have a positive effect .
high fees for fiscal transfers must be kept to a minimum .
